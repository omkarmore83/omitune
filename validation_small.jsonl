I was beginning to regret not getting the lasik instead but the expense was too much. \n \n Still, how could I be anything but delighted when they finally arrived? My vision was spectacular. I could make out the tiniest subtleties in the Ents and their wild leaves, absorbing the sunlight. It was as if I could see grass growing. The all-seeing woman had done it this time. Even the pebbles beneath my feet were visibly rolling with time. Amazing. \n \n I headed home down the cobbestone road and marveled at the tiniest things. How had I lived this long without seeing the snakes in the grass? Too long. \n \n When I reached my modest cottage my world began to spin - well not literally. As magical as my spectacles were, I still could n't see that. But I could see that my thatched roof was on fire. \n \n Terrified, I ran inside to save my beloved dog. He was all I had in the world and I would perish before I lost my dearest friend. Just as I entered I saw the fire burning out to embers on my roof. Only a part of it had been ignited and it burnt out so quickly. Perhaps I had a chance in hell of keeping my house afterall. I could live with a new skylight. \n \n Yet where was Soot? He usually was at the door waiting. It took far too long for my new glasses to clue me in as to what happened when I noticed it. \n \n The sinuous, black-scaled dragonkinde on my bed leaving nothing to the imagination. She was in truth, more humanoid than dragon but no taller than my chest. Yet still dangerous, very dangerous. \n \n `` I am sorry, dear one. I sneezed.'' I blinked. SHE sounded just like my talking dog, only with scales and wings..and breasts. \n \n `` Where have you been all my life?!'' I exclaimed, walking to the bed in confusion. `` And where's Soot?'' I was only partially upset, for I had a mostly naked woman in my bed and I was n't about to toss her out. \n \n `` It's me! Do n't you remember? We played fetch just this morning!'' I stood gaping, still confused that my male dog had become feminine, not to mention a dragonkinde. \n \n While I never did figure out the specifics, the gypsy woman yelled a lot of nonsense when I stole my new glasses earlier in the morning and I never quite could look Soot in the eyes after that, knowing I violated her trust with peanut butter that one time...\n"}

Her favorite station had been forced to shut down, but she kept the dial tuned to the frequency anyway, just in case. She flung her arm in a haphazard arc over her head, narrowly missing her target, and managed to catch the corner of her bedside table directly between two of the bones in her hand. \n \n Today was going to be great. \n \n She cursed profusely, first because of the pain in her hand, second, because once she finally got a look at the clock, she saw that she'd already successfully hit the snooze button three times: her bus would be leaving in five minutes, and she had at least a two minute run to get to the stop. She quickly pulled off her pajamas and shimmied into some distressingly tight jeans. She glanced around the room, trying to determine which piles of clothes would at least seem the least wrinkled. \n \n `` Please.'' \n \n She paused for a moment. \n \n She decided the top from yesterday would have to do, plus it had the added bonus of still containing the tangled mess of straps that could probably be rearranged into a bra. \n \n She flipped her backpack over her shoulder as she darted out the door, her mom shouting `` You better hurry, dear!'' As she slammed it behind her. \n \n `` Stop.'' \n \n She stops. \n \n Then takes a deep breath, bounces on her toes, and takes off down the dewy sidewalk. Her heart is racing, she can hear the blood pumping in her ears. The only two thoughts in her head are `` I can make it.'' And `` I might actually have to use the school showers during gym.'' She sees the bus, pulled up along the far side of the street. She approaches the street and glances both ways: there's a car coming but it's pretty far, she can probably make it across before it gets here. \n \n She should have known. \n \n The moment her foot hits the slick pavement, she knows.

He ca n't see the woman, buried as she was in the man's shoulder. They looked familiar. As he thought that, another wave of tears flooded his vision. He wiped them away and looked at the officer in front of him. \n `` Do you understand?'' the officer asked. \n `` Do I understand...?'' He repeated, as if he did n't even understand the words. \n `` Do you even remember?'' the officer asked again, clearly angry. \n He did. He had been driving that car. He had been reading something on his phone when that kid had jumped into the street. He did n't even see her.

However , the other day they did something which made you think maybe they 're not imaginary after all .\n","story":"His name was Gabriel. He kept me company as I wandered. \n \n Gabriel always knew what to say as I walked through the lonely world. He made me feel less guilty that I was immune. He said that God picked me for a reason, to leave a record so that the next people who came upon our world would know. And I always believed him, because he was my only friend left. \n \n I'd avoided civilization since it spread. It was too grim to see the people lying there, and the stench was awful. The deteriorating city blocks was like something out of a Dal\u00ed painting, with people slumped over rotting benches and crumbling stonework. Gabriel told me to get out to nature. There, things would be alive, there would be room for growth again. Like how Chernobyl became a haven for wildlife, perhaps our planet would regain that same vibrancy, he said. Those words comforted me, but I still missed my family. \n \n He would point out all the beautiful things, like waterfalls and mountains and the sky, things that were always there but we ignored. Sometimes I wonder if the virus was Earth's way of punishing us for destroying that wilderness. The doctors and scientists said to `` stay inside and use proper air filters'' and that symptoms included `` drastically reduced CD4-positive T cell counts, leading to immunodeficiency and opportunistic infection.'' I remember it because it was playing on repeat when I was walking out of the city. Eventually though, people had to try and get food, get supplies... \n \n... If you asked me to describe what he looked like, I could n't tell you. That's because one of the magical things about Gabriel is that each day he would look different. One day he was a sloth-person, walking upright and scratching his head in bewilderment. Other days, he was a rainbow-colored snail with five tentacles on his head. Some days, he was as tall as a skyscraper, with only one eye. \n \n Yesterday, he looked like me. \n \n I did n't think that he was real, but yesterday, I caught a vine on my shoe and tripped, tumbling down a steep cliff. I closed my eyes and screamed, knowing that it was the end. I knew I could n't die yet, I did n't figure out my purpose being chosen -- if I truly was God's pick, then I must have been a failure. But as I felt the blood rushing from the gash on my arm, I saw him, Gabriel, as me, and he picked me up as I lost consciousness. I woke up in a cavern, with a blanket woven from leaves covering me, without a scratch. \n \n Gabriel did n't come around today. I'm afraid he's gone forever. \n \n I do n't know if he really was my imaginary friend, or some sort of guardian. But he saved me.

The man was a maniac and the only reason no-one had stood up to him was because he could get them fired at a moment's notice and his psychotic temper. \n \n Just as security had arrived the door violently swung open and the woman was thrown out to the ground by the hair.'I just fired this cunt!' he yelled, shocking everyone.'Get her out of here NOW!! All of you, back to work!' \n \n The guards were good people, helping her up and out while also calling HR and reporting his outburst. \n \n As I went back to the cubicle beside mine, Tim silently hung up and then went back to filing his report.'I just called the police,' he silently said to me.'Shit... Carol did n't deserve that.' \n \n I knew why it happened - despite how much of a terrible reason it was - but I decided to humor my colleague.'What did she do to set him off?' \n \n'She scratched his Lamborghini on the way in this morning,' he answered me.'A small scratch...' \n \n We quieted down as the HR representatives walked towards his office, entering and locking the door behind them. Tim carefully put an earpiece in his head and tapped the screen of his phone, collecting more evidence that he can use to denounce his soon-to-be former employer as he plans to leave the current job of writing tech manuals. \n \n To mortals of old, I was once known as a God. I did n't particularly enjoy the worship, especially when they completely misrepresented me to fit their ideals, but I did enjoy watching them in life and granting boons to those I had found... interesting. Of course, a minor deity, learning of my odd fascination with humans, challenged me to live among them as long as possible and masquerade as a mortal. If I could reach the 20-year mark, I'd win our little contest. \n \n Unfortunately, Brad was my manager within this company. He was one of those people who had rich parents who cared more about their reputation rather than treating their son. But he knows what he's doing harms others and enjoys it. He was currently trying to frame Carol for embezzling funds from the company, to `` Get back the wages that treacherous bitch should never have been paid''. \n \n Tim had heard that and was growing uncomfortable. We had almost rejoiced when 5 o'clock arrived and HR dismissed us so that Brad could hold us back for unpaid `` overtime''. \n \n I had gotten back to my apartment, a rather cheap place in the mortal realm. I wanted to just kick back, relax with a beer and watch the game. Beer... why did Leviticus and Mohammed say I had denounced this drink? \n \n That's when I got a phone call from Tim.'Hey, what's wrong?' I asked. I knew he was distressed, but tried to play it cool. \n \n'Dude, Brad found out I called the cops on him,' Tim gasped.'He just kicked my door in... broke one of my cells- Fuck!' \n \n'What's wrong?' I asked.'Tim?!' \n \n'He broke my fucking leg!' \n \n I did n't believe I could, but I snapped.'I'll get someone over there right now,' I said as I hung up. I knew he was watching me, so I decided to make my intentions clear.'I'm forfeiting our bet.' \n \n'Are you?' Ares asked as he appeared leaning on my counter.'I mean, you do now owe me-' \n \n My human form disappeared as I enveloped his entire body with one of my hands.'No time,' I stated.'I want you to go to this mortal, make sure his injuries are n't fatal and protect him as a guardian spirit. If you have to appear to him, so be it.' \n \n'Appear to a mortal?' Ares asked in shock.'Are you mad?' \n \n'Ares, I will honor our deal but if that mortal, my best friend, *dies* I will do to *you* what I *did to **C'thulhu and his kin**! *' \n \n Ares was a brave being but anyone would be scared of just how I had devoured the most primordial and powerful beings in existence. He disappeared, heading to Tim. \n \n I, however, transported myself to Brad's house just as he was entering, Tim's blood all over his hands.'And that fucker ruined my suit...' he grumbled before falling down into the basement.'What the fuck?' \n \n Then he saw me, a being made entirely of scales. To most mortals I'd appear as a dragon, which is precisely what my angelic progeny appeared as while flying around me, breathing lighting, fire and snowstorms as my 10 legs menacingly stomped towards him. I unfolded my 12 wings, stared him down with the 20 eyes on 5 heads, grinned with my 10 mouths then spoke through all of them in unison,'Bradley Densin?' \n \n'What the... what the fuck are you?!' he screamed as he grabbed a vase, throwing it at one of my heads. \n \n'Oh, me?' I spoke, repairing the vase and returning it to the table.'See, in olden days mortals such as yourself called me YHWH. Nowadays Christians, Jews and Muslims pray to me as the deity who created Existence and being the one true god... which is n't exactly true. I *did* create this world, but there are many gods. Although I prefer to use the term *meals*.' \n \n He was now sweating like a pig in a heatwave, a sensation I took great pleasure in causing. \n \n'Although... none call me by my true name of Bahamut. I use many names to wander this world, more to sate my boredom than anything. See, you may not know it... but you have made a rather grave, *personal* slight against me.' \n \n'I-I'll give you anything!' Brad tried to plead as his back met the wall, supporting himself to prevent his legs from giving out.'I have money! I have so much money!' \n \n'Did n't I tell you?' I said, leering two of my heads on each side of him.'I'm a god, I have no need for *money*. Although there is one thing you can give me.' \n \n'Just name it!' he screamed.'Just do n't hurt me!' \n \n In my 100 billion years, that was the first to get me to genuinely laugh.'You do n't get it, do you? ***HURTING YOU IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANT!! ***' \n \n The physical realm dispersed into dark space as I spoke and soon there were only two sounds being made; the screams of this pathetic human, and my wings. \n \n'Oh, the satisfaction that your death throes will bring me,' I said with satin-like grace in my voice before I began my work. \n \n'Of course, in time. \n \n The authorities arrived at Brad's residence 30 minutes. They found him bloodied and wounded, but he'd recover from his physical trauma. The psychological effects of the damage I inflicted to his soul would never heal, however. He was soon institutionalized. \n \n Carol got her job back plus damages over what Brad did to her. Tim recovered with surprising speed. He was aware of my identity now but he had also struck up a friendship with Ares. \n \n I did honor my bet with Ares, however. He wanted to know a secret of the universe that no other deity was aware of. He regretted it, but a deal's a deal - he wanted to know precisely souls came from, after all. \n \n And that's why I'm the king of the gods, bitches.\n"}

During the coronation ceremony , he places the crown on a servant 's head and declares him king , rather than one of his two sons .\n","story":"`` This is... unlawful,'' whispered the red-robed man, hands closing on the shoulders of two young boys who stood in front of him. Prince Karlovi was four. Prince Iskar only two. \n \n `` Do I not make the law?'' King Karlov was pock-marked and sallow faced, but he managed to deliver the line with enough force that the courtiers turned their faces away from both king and lord chancellor, so as not to witness the forthcoming shame of the latter. \n \n `` Of course, Sire, but the people will not accept this.'' And it was true. Folk heroes were well enough in the tales, but it rankled the nobility to see one so low raised above them, and would rankle to peasantry to see one of their own ascend for his connections. \n \n `` A disappointment!'' exclaimed the king, `` The very word! Dis-appointment! You're merely upset that you sha n't have your chance to play voice behind the throne to the lads.'' And this was true too. The appointment had been a recent one, granted not by the king but by the House of Lords in order to temper his Magesty's increasingly erratic policymaking. They had had the Code of Dur in mind when they'd made the declaration of course: by rights, he ought to have become co-regent alongside the Queen Dowager when his Majesty passed, but the man who now wore the crown was no minor. \n \n His name was Urich, and he has been the king's cup-bearer in both the literal and the Jovian sense. His Majesty's tastes had been well known to all at court, of course, but to pass over one's own sons to suit one's lover... and low-born at that! \n \n `` There is no one I trust more than Urich,'' the king was saying now, `` For I know he looks upon my sons as his own, and I know that he has sworn to take no wife so long as they both live.'' He was shaking beneath his furs, the Lord Chancellor saw, not with cold but with the effort of holding himself upright. \n \n `` What of Queen Iskara, Karlov?'' When he spoke, Urich's voice was soft as ever. \n \n The king answered with a sneer. `` A woman? What do women know of love? Of duty? You think the kingdom would do better under a bitch and a cur? You do not think highly enough of yourself, King Urich. Yes, *King* Urich, for king is what I've made you. You've been by my side through countless council meetings while she was off playing pretty maids with her ladies or practicing her embroidery.'' But this was a half truth, for King Karlov had forbade the queen and her court from attending council meetings. \n \n It was over all too quickly. The king, pleading his poor health, hurried through the rest of the ceremony and the courtiers, deprived of the chance for discussion, swore their allegiance to the new king and were dismissed. King Urich smiled wanly at the Lord Chancellor who still kept a protective hand on the shoulder of the two little boys. \n \n `` Fear not, Lord Chancellor Brecht. I intend to marry the Queen Dowager when my beloved Karlov passes. I shall make the boys my heirs by marriage if not by blood, and all will be right in the eyes of the people.'' \n \n But the Lord Chancellor drew no comfort from this. It was well known King Karlov's illness had rendered him impotent these last six years.\n"}

I poured myself a cup of coffee and set it down on the table to cool as I made myself breakfast: microwaved pizza. \n \n \u201c Fat fucking slob. \u201d \n \n \u201c Mmmhmm. \u201d \n \n Cassiel sat on the table glaring at me. Man, that guy just did not blink. Like ever. I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s an angel thing either, his eyes were always so bloodshot. \n \n Cassiel is my guardian angel, by the way. I \u2019 m the only one who can see him and he \u2019 s sworn to God himself to protect me from harm. He also really doesn \u2019 t like me. I \u2019 m not entirely sure why, but it \u2019 s whatever. I just think it \u2019 s pretty neat that God wants to protect me for some reason. \n \n \u201c Hey Cassie, we \u2019 re going to the city today to pick up some groceries. How \u2019 s that sound? \u201d \n \n \u201c Get a job, you freeloading piece of shit. Worthless fucking pig. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, it sounds peachy to me too.

It \u2019 s old, grumbly, and not very reliable, but I love it. I hopped in my truck, cracked the window ( yeah, I had roll it down, no fancy-ass features for me ), lit a cigarette, and cranked the engine. Cassiel sat in the passenger seat, glaring at me. \n \n \u201c Yeah, I know these things will kill me, no need to preach. \u201d \n \n Cassiel just sat there in sullen silence. \n \n \u201c Oh right, you \u2019 re protecting me. So, no lung cancer, right? \u201d \n \n Silence. \n \n \u201c Praise God, it \u2019 s going to be a wonderful day. \u201d \n \n I shifted into drive and pulled out of my apartment complex. I tuned the radio to my favorite station \u2013 an alt rock, top 100 hits something or another. I had enough time to finish my smoke before we reached the grocery store. Cassiel just glared at me the whole ride. \n \n I parked and we walked inside. Well, Cassiel kinda hovered, I guess. I picked up a cart and we started shopping. \n \n \u201c You think I should go with the 1 % or 2 % milk, Cassie? \u201d \n \n \u201c I hope you die friendless and the buzzards feed on your corpse. \u201d \n \n \u201c Like, I don \u2019 t even really know what the percentages represent. Fat content? Fat content, right? \u201d \n \n \u201c This world would have been better off if your father had spilled the seed from which you came into the mouth of a cheap whore. \u201d \n \n \u201c Is just one percent even that big of a difference? \u201d \n \n \u201c I fucking hate you so much. \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m going to get you some eye drops, bud. Your peepers don \u2019 t look that good. \u201d \n \n After we finished getting everything for the apartment, I rolled the cart over to the checkout line. \n \n \u201c Ooh, Cass, look, the pretty girl is working. Think I should talk to her? \u201d \n \n \u201c The only good you \u2019 ll ever do is provide a home for maggots. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, confidence is key.

A man was walking towards us. He was wearing a black ski mask, a wife beater, and raggy looking jeans. He was also carrying an ugly black gun. \n \n Brittney screamed and dropped to the floor.

I've always had a sort of irrational fear of flying, being thousands of meters in the air and not knowing whether or not my plane would have the minuscule chance of becoming just another crash statistic. My eyes met with the stranger's, his were a sky blue and his hair black like oil and slicked back. He wore a rather swanky business suit. His tie was blood red along with his matching handkerchief, protruding out his front jacket pocket. His legs were calmly crossed and he leaned in ever so slightly. \n `` I said the plane will crash'' he whispered. \n I could see the neatness of his pencil mustache, probably just recently trimmed. His breath had the distinct odor of peppermint and vodka. \n `` What?'' I managed to whimper, clearly shaken by what the man had said. \n He laughed loudly and then louder and louder. Soon his malicious laughed seem to echo throughout the entire plane. \n `` Your drunk'' I said disgustingly as I got up to use the restroom. I was still visibly shaken and sweating even after I reached the toilets. I stopped an attendant as I waited for the bathroom to become vacant and asked her if I could change seats. \n `` My neighbor is very rude and unpleasant'' I explained politely. `` Plus I'm sure he is drunk, and you should have heard what he told me...'' \n The attendant asked where was I sitting. As I turned to point the plane suddenly began to shake violently. I was thrown down and quickly crawled back to my seat. I climbed my chair and turned to look up at the man. He was gone. Where he was sitting was a copy of the New York Times. The headline read `` Plane Crashes Outside Newark.''\n"}

It was a normal Tuesday morning. I had the day off so I made the executive decision to play video games in my underwear all day only because i could n't think of any reason not to. It was around lunch time so I stood in my kitchen making a couple of sandwiches. They were nothing special containing only, a bit of turkey, pepper jack cheese, and some mustard. `` Sandwich, sandwich, what's that? Sandwich!'' I sang while applying the mustard to my bread. Everything was normal, but my dancing messed up the concentric circles I normally make with my mustard causing some weird symbol instead. \n \n The sky turned black and the room suddenly smelled of ozone. The hairs on the back of my neck started to raise as if somebody was watching me. `` You have summoned me? Algorch the Lord of Terror?'' A voice said, it spoke softly, but it chilled me to my core. `` What is your bidding, you who have activated my sigil?'' I turned slowly to see a twelve-foot tall monster made of flame and rock. `` Did my fucking roommate dose me with acid again?'' was the first thought that came into my mind, but I had had worse trips so I decided to roll with it. `` I dunno man.

I said I'll come just to please him, actually I had a girl last night, Sarah, but I did n't tell him yet. \n \n As in every year, before the vacation, the seniors were doing the `` end of the year'' prank, This year it was breaking into all the class rooms with masks and chainsaws scaring the teachers and the freshmans. Naturally, when they came running into my class the numbers came rushing with them, it felt like my head is exploding with binary numbers. \n \n When I was a child my father thought I was a mathematical genius, it was only after I saw my fisrt 7th' in the paper, convicted for a triple homicide when I started realizing what was up. I never told anyone. But that moment, I had to get away from all the numbers threatening to melt my brain off. \n \n From obvious reasons I tried to stay away of crouded places, one of them being the school hallway, but that moment I had to pass it in my way to the backyard. People were noticing me as I ran through, they always did, some tried to stop me, some asked what was wrong, a rare-sencetive senior who was afraid I got panicked from the prank asked me `` Hey, are you ok man? ``, I did n't affort to answer him, just kept on running. My mind was blank, faces were flying infront of me, I did n't see who they were but I recognized their expressions, and their numbers. \n `` Hey, watch it freak'' a 1 yelled out as I pushed him into a window. \n `` Look at this kid, those seniors crossed the line this time'' talked two female zeros, teachers I guess. \n The river of numbers kept flowing as my mind became dry. \n \n At the end of the hall were the stairs, though I was new in this school it was n't my first time of fleeing to the backyard and I already knew the way by heart. Breathless, I climbed the stairs while pushing surprised students marked in one and twos and a couple of teachers, my heart was speeding when I reached to top, from there you can see the exit - finally! I ran out, praying for loneliness that did appear, though did n't last for long... \n \n My arms were resting on my knees while I was trying to recover my breath when I felt something, at first I thought it was nothing, but the moment later, as I was turning, starting to head back, I knew what was wrong. The chill went through my back in the speed of light - one of them, I said to my self slowly, one of the students I passed was a 10. I could n't move, I opened my mouth but there were no words coming out. My legs dragged me back against my will, I knew what I'm gon na see there. \n \n When I finally got back it was to late, the hallway was not the one Iv'e seen 10 minutes ago, it was filled with blood stains. I froze, my first thought after was `` I could have done something'', the last was `` I know who this was'', turning around, I saw him infront of me, holding a pistol and a big `` 10'' was floating above his head. \n `` Michael'' I whispered, I looked down and saw Sarah, Michael's girlfriend with a hole in her back.

They'll be back in a bit, and they're bringing treats.'' \n \n Kip looks at me, showing the whites of his eyes. `` Why do n't they ever take us?'' \n \n I narrow my eyes at him. `` Probably that time you took off down the block.'' \n \n `` That time I did?'' He huffs. `` How many times did you take off while I went to the car like a good boy?'' \n \n `` Be nice, you two,'' my sister warns us, still tapping away at that glowing book. I hate that thing. She always pays more attention to it than to us. I know she uses it to talk-without-words to someone -- she does n't treat it like a toy -- but still. \n \n I come over and put my head on her knee. It's the best I can do, with how much shorter I am. `` Come on, Matilda. We can get in your car and go after mom, like we did that time when I was a baby?'' \n \n `` Come on, do n't do that.'' She put a hand on my head, comfortingly. `` Take a nap. Lat down on the couch with me.'' Then she patted the couch next to her, and I climbed up beside her. \n \n Then the cat meowed and hopped up onto the arm of the chair next to her. Jealous little bastard. She reached over and started rubbing both our heads, soothingly, glowing book untouched in her lap. \n \n Kip let a sad little whine and climbed up into the armchair by himself. \n \n I looked over at Matilda and the cat, at the faces she was making at him as she scratched behind his ear. She pouted her strange, flat face at him, cooing, calling him a pretty kitty. For a second, I remember one of her nicknames for me, `` pretty puppy,'' but that just means she treats the cat too much like a person, I'm sure. \n \n `` Kip, do you remember our first family?'' \n \n `` Yeah, why?'' \n \n `` Was dad actually our dad?'' \n \n He looks over at me, putting his face on the arm of the chair, looking at me from around the cat. `` I do n't know. But I do n't think so. Would a real dad kick you? Our new dad does n't kick you.'' \n \n That's true. No one here kicks me. And no one kicks Matilda, or the cat. \n \n `` But... He was n't our dad. We were all in that cage, with mom.'' \n \n `` Until you guys all went away,'' he notes, picking his nose with his tongue. `` Then mom and I went in the house with Rover and OtherMom and Dad. There just was n't enough room for all us kids.'' \n \n I roll over next to Matilda, and she starts rubbing my chest. `` But then you came here?'' \n \n `` Because I kept peeing everywhere. They sent me away because I was bad. But joke's on our old Dad! These guys are way nicer.'' \n \n I give Matilda's hand a lick. She does n't seem to understand us, and while she's petting me, her attention is focused on that orange cat. `` Matilda's bad all the time and these guys never send her away.'' \n \n `` She's blood.'' As if to emphasize his point, Kip takes a sniff. `` She's really mom's baby. Not dad's, though.'' \n \n He does have a point there. They smell the same. They look the same. Sometimes they even sound the same. Their personalities could n't be more different, but then again, neither could mine and Kip's. \n \n `` Do you ever think we're more like the cat than Matilda?'' I finally ask. \n \n `` Nah,'' he answers. `` Have you heard the difference in how mom and dad and Matilda talk to us?'' \n \n I have, but I've also heard the difference in how mom and dad talk to Matilda instead of us. \n \n `` Who's a wittle pretty kitty,'' Matilda coos at the cat, before finally shouting `` OW! no bites!'' \n \n The cat takes off running, all four legs, just like we do. \n \n `` Matilda,'' I ask, `` Are we really your brothers? Or are we pets, like the cat?'' \n \n `` What is it, Ken?'' she asks, not understanding, petting my chest. `` Mom and dad are n't going to be home for a while. Oh, did you think I hurt the kitty?'' \n \n No. No I did n't. \n \n `` The kitty hurt me. See?'' She holds out her hand to me, and I see an angry scratch across her finger. I kiss it better. She squirms -- she hates that, but she gives me a pat anyway. \n \n `` Why do n't you understand me?'' I ask `` I understand you, most of the time.'' \n \n She puts the glowing book on the table and turns to me. `` It's ok. Why are you whining?'' \n \n `` Why wo n't you answer me?'' \n \n `` What's wrong? Do you want a treat?''

His treats are next to mine. \n \n But Matilda and Dad's treats are way up high, on the highest shelf... where neither the cat nor I can reach them. \n \n I run in, climb into mom's bed, and try to remember my real mother.\n"}

I think it fits though, and this is where the prompt led me. ) \n \n Even through his squeezed eyelids The Man could tell there was a blinding light in front of him. `` Not Good'' He thought as his mind cycled through images of spotlights and guard towers and checkpoints, squads of soldiers shouting and pointing rifles at the man that popped into existence in front of them. \n \n The Man lifted an arm to shield his eyes from the light and as he did he felt a nagging sensation that something was wrong. \n \n As his eyelids began to part he realized what was bothering him, `` It's quiet.'' There was none of the expected noise, no footsteps or sirens, not even leaves rustling or insects chirping. Now that he was aware of it the silence became deafening, The Man's mind was intent on finding input where there was none. \n \n This was a stark shift from the world of a few seconds earlier, where The Man had stood at the center of a devil's symphony. The many modules of the Tether had all seemed to play their own song, each rising as the machine around the Man gathered and shaped the energy to send him back in time.The noise did n't stop rising until finally the Tether accomplished it's goal and flung The Man nearly two-hundred years into the past. \n \n The light pained The Man as he tried to look around, but all he can see, other than his own arm in front of him, is white. His surroundings simply offer no hint as to their shape or distance. `` Did they fuck up the jump? What the hell am I seeing here?'' \n \n The two questions were immediately vacated from his mind as the light disappeared. Whatever ground The Man was standing seemed to have gone with the light, but just as The Man felt himself falling he crumpled harmlessly on what seemed to be solid ground. \n \n `` Oh fuck...'' The Man groaned as he righted himself. Looking around he can see another man a few yards away, but the afterimage from the light made it impossible to discern much apart from the shape of the other man. \n \n `` Yeah that part sucks, you're safe to stand now though.'' The Other Man's voice was calm, almost bored. \n \n `` Where am I?'' The Man said. \n \n `` Not Munich. You got pretty close though, we almost missed the energy signature.'' \n \n `` How do you...'' The Man tried to stand but collapsed again as waves of nausea rolled through him. \n \n `` Oh, you should probably wait a while actually. Find a wall to lean on first too.'' The Other Man paused to regard The Man, then said `` Trying to kill Hitler, yeah? Bad idea man. This whole century is off limits.'' \n \n `` Off limits?'' The Man's voice was weak from the nausea but notes of uncertainty and confusion were clear. \n \n `` Well we ca n't have anyone altering history to fit their vision. Time travel is messy, you can change big things to little effect, and little things to big effect.'' The Other Man was gesturing along to his words. `` At some point someone built this place to keep important time periods safe. Hitler is important because he leads Germany into WWII, yeah? That's why people want to kill him, well, broadly anyway.'' \n \n `` The thing is, even though he's a bad person, he helps deter a worse fate for humanity.'' \n \n `` Just because he's the lesser of two evils does n't mean he deserves to be saved.'' The Man had mostly recovered from the nausea, and there was anger in his voice. \n \n `` Alright, so you kill Hitler. Someone else would take his place, the Nazi's would still come to power.'' \n \n `` Then I'll kill them too.'' \n \n The Other Man sighed heavily, `` So we just keep killing until history meets our standards? We're not gods for fuck's sake! We ca n't just impose ourselves upon the past.'' \n \n `` We have the power to stop so much suffering, why should n't we use it? If I can kill Hitler and make WWII less bloody then I owe it to humanity to try.'' The Man had found a wall and was bracing against it as he slowly stood up. \n \n `` This is n't about any one man. This place exists not to protect Hitler and other individual people, it exists to protect our heritage. Changing our past changes the course of humanity, it changes what we become as a species.'' The Other Man paused. `` In this case it also saves us from annihilation.'' \n \n The Man gave a disgusted look,'' What, the world turns into 1984 if Hitler dies? Or we nuke ourselves to death?'' \n \n `` No, not quite.'' The Other Man crossed his arms. `` In 1943 an alien craft observes Earth from orbit, from what we have been able to gather they saw the state of the world as redeemable but our leaders as a problem. Specifically it was Hitler and his public persona that scared them off. They decided to put off official contact for at least five years.'' \n \n `` Aliens. We ca n't kill Hitler because of aliens?'' The Man smiled at the absurdity of it. \n \n `` Well, you'll notice that they never contacted us. In fact they never returned. All we know of them we have from the ruins of a few of their planets, and it seems that they intended to bring us into that fold. They entered a war of their own though, one that wiped out both sides in a short span. All the evidence we have suggests the war ended before a month had passed.'' \n \n `` How do you know any of this?'' The Man's face and voice brimmed with skepticism. \n \n `` I know what I need to know. I handle World War Two along with some other people. The information I just gave you comes from my home time's future, but here at the Station it does n't matter when something was, only that humans found out.'' \n \n `` That's a lot to process. How do you know any of the stuff you just said is true? And how did you end up here? What... when is this place?'' The Man still sounded skeptical, but his brow was furrowed with frustration and confusion. The combined efforts of the past few minutes were clearly straining The Man. \n \n `` How about you get some rest first, maybe take a nap. I'll get you to a bunk. We can finish the Q and A later.'' The Other Man advanced toward The Man, then stopped. `` Oh, and do n't try anything stupid, we'll kill you.'' \n \n\n"}

Easy as swatting a gnat from a book. * \n \n `` So what do we use when it's the glass, Mike?'' Donald asked, using the kind of tone one usually reserved for small children and not, Mikrathrin reflected, mages with power enough to flay a continent. \n \n `` The blue stuff, Mr. Crist,'' Mikrathrin said in a soft voice. \n \n `` You got it, bud!'' Donald said, plucking the appropriate bottle from the supply shelf and passing it to Mikrathrin. `` Why do n't you try it out on Conference Seven?'' \n \n `` Can do.'' \n \n Donald grinned at that, gave Mikrathrin a friendly slap on the shoulder, and left. The ancient mage watched him go, then stared at the blue bottle of cleaning solution in his hands. `` It's what you wanted,'' he said to himself, to the voice in his heart pleading for him to raze the building and leave nothing but the immaculate windows of Conference Seven standing in the rubble. \n \n `` And where would that lead?'' he asked aloud, gathering supplies from the room and adding them to his cleaning cart. `` Another empire? More followers, more victims, more enemies?'' \n \n He fingered his employee badge, the grainy laminated photo of him in a janitor's jumpsuit seeming a little less droll each day. `` At least this is new.'' \n \n And so Mikrathrin cleaned the windows by hand, endured hollow praise from Mr. Crist, and continued his rounds, helping to put the accountants' offices in order and wondering when this life would start to feel rewarding. \n \n A week passed, and Donald declared his training period complete, doing so with a deeply patronizing amount of pomp. There was even a certificate for it, still warm from the copier, and Mikrathrin was surprised to find all the words on it spelled correctly. \n \n A month later, Mikrathrin's tireless, quiet efficiency had legitimately impressed Donald, to the point where the praise he bestowed actually felt genuine. That this brought the barest ounce of pleasure to Mikrahthrin was something that kept him awake long after he should have fallen asleep. \n \n Three months down the road, and Mikrathrin finally agreed to accompany his co-workers to an all-hours bar. It was, like the rest of their lives, cheap, pointless, loud, and foul-smelling. It was also the best outing Mikrathrin could remember experiencing in three centuries. He joined his co-workers every time they asked after that, and once he started helping them win the trivia contests, those invitations became quite frequent, indeed. \n \n A year, and Mikrathrin accepted the management position from Donald, who took a higher-paying job at another site. Mikrathrin had n't wanted it - had been quite clear he'd never desired a leadership role - and was summarily told that was partly why he'd gotten it. \n \n Two years, and Mikrathrin's division of the cleaning service was the most highly-rated in the company. His salary, unnecessary though it might have been, was no longer quite so pathetic, and his circle of friends held him in genuine regard. Part of him hated it - hated the pandering, miserable, future-less grind of it all, the directionless, repetitive mess of a life these peasants clutched at simply because it was all they knew - but after all this time, he'd come to realize part of him would always hate everything. Fact was, while he was not exactly happy, he was content, and though he was not quite sure how, this empty, unmotivated life left him more fulfilled than a thousand years of spellforged conquest. \n \n Three years in, and Mikrathrin realized it was n't the job, or the friends, or the accolades that had brought him peace - it was the expectations he'd placed on himself. He had gone into this hoping for a change of pace, a life away from mystic duels and the chatter of demons, and along the way, he'd sort of assumed it would all be for nothing. \n \n That it had been for anything - even the slightest thing - was enough. He'd accomplished fantastic things in his long life, yet here, in a simple job of simple tasks carried out alongside simple minds, where even the smallest accomplishment could be heralded with cheers and drinks and photocopied certificates, everything seemed to count just a little more. \n \n Thousands of years, the power of gods, and nothing in all of that had ever made Mikrathrin happier than a clean window. It would *never* be deeply rewarding or meaningful, and that, he was delighted to realize, was rather the point.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Thanks to a bureaucratic error , you are now Satan .\n","story":"`` Honey, take a look at this!'' \n \n Stan gawked at the richly appointed vellum-like paper grasped between his hands. He was trembling. \n \n `` Sweetie, what is it? You look sick.'' \n \n He shook the paper under her nose, then held it up close for her to read. \n \n As Stan's wife scrunched her face up to read, it continued to become more and more pinched in expression. Stan was, however... excited. \n \n `` Do n't you see? I've got the power to make our lives as enjoyable as we want.'' \n \n `` It's a joke, sweetie. Relax. I think this is a joke.'' \n \n Her voice warbled slightly at the end, giving away her trepidation. \n \n `` Besides, how would you even know how to perform the beastly duties?'' \n \n Stan shrugged his shoulders. He took the official envelope and the thick document paper into the living room of their house. Their house; maybe they could get a new house. \n \n It was n't a bad home, he thought. Plus they'd managed to get it under market value too. Marsha had always wanted to move into a house like this to have kids, but Stan had never been terribly keen on the idea. In fact, he had even considered secretly getting a vasectomy to eliminate the chance and just play it off as his inability to have children. In the end, he'd never followed through for a variety of reasons, but mostly because Stan loved Marsha and did n't want to ruin their relationship. Still, he envied the bachelors with fancy high-rise apartments and decked-out pads. \n \n He paused, wondering why he'd taken that trip down memory lane. He was n't prone to critical thinking when it came to internalized thoughts. \n \n He was tapping the official document to his cheek, tongue pressed against his teeth as he just stood there. Marsha was watching from the kitchen doorway, and she had to clear her throat several times to get his attention. \n \n `` Hey, I asked what you wanted for dinner. Any ideas?'' \n \n He turned to face her, looking at her. He could tell she disliked his indecisiveness. He could never make up his mind and was always chasing some idea or dream that never worked out and only wasted their resources. \n \n Marsha smiled at him patiently. \n \n `` Hey, earth to Sta-'' \n \n `` You know, Marsha, if you do n't like waiting on me to make up my mind you can just make a damn decision and fill me in on the details later.'' \n \n He seethed. And a moment after, he caught up with himself and stood in the shocked silence as husband and wife stared at one another. One confused by the other's sharp remark, the other confused by how he knew. \n \n Marsha tried to make her mouth work, to claim her voice again and speak. Instead she just pursed her lips and turned back into the kitchen. To cook... \n \n `` Spaghetti. Gross. Come on, Marsha. You know I hate that... and that's why you're making it.'' \n \n Stan could n't stop himself. He was smirking now, but he did n't understand why. Something had sidled right up into his soul and taken the reins. He could peer right into Marsha, see her intent and her thoughts and all her vices. Strangely, he could n't see the love, the compassion that she felt. For him, it may as well not have existed. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Marsha cried over the kitchen sink quietly. Her husband had gone crazy. Some prank had flipped his switch and he was spouting nonsense. \n \n Except a little voice whispered to her that he was n't ever as perceptive as he was today. How had he known? And if he had known those things, he should of course know how much Marsha had done for him out of her love for her man, her partner for eight years. Sure, she had decided to make spaghetti out of spite, but only to get him to see that his opinions did matter to her, even if they took a really fucking long time to come to. \n \n She dropped the wet noodles into the pot with a dash of olive oil and set to adding the sauce, stirring with vigor. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Stan laid in bed that night, sitting next to the woman he had once loved. The more it built up in him, the more he could n't stand to be near her. All the vile thoughts, the slights, the betrayals. The little things and the big. It added up to something that was greater than the sum; his passenger, the beast that now clung to his soul, was feeding on it. Dinner had been silent, intolerable. He could n't stay here anymore. \n \n He needed to travel, to get away. Stan needed to see if everyone was as bad as Marsha. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Several weeks later, Stan was walking down a crowded street in New York, where lots of people crossed his path and also kept pace with him. His face was a mask. His soul was cleansed by all the vile things he could tell they were thinking, feeling. A rapist walked out in broad daylight, uncaught. A small-time thief had another man's wallet in his jacket. A thug. A liar. A cheater. An egotist. Lots of those. \n \n He bathed in their thoughts, and came out clean on the other side. A small complex began to build into a larger one in Stan; everyone was terrible, but he was n't so great either. Why should he hate them for it? Everyone, every single one. Terrible. \n \n Stan began to use his powers. \n \n He had many of them, but his favorite was to coax people into a deeper, darker line of their faults and flaws. Not only did it amuse him, he found that their stronger, darker, deeper thoughts and feelings were like a drug to him. Stan needed them, and they apparently needed him to push them. Just a little nudge here or there. Make a coffee cup spill at the register. A customer curses and refuses to pay, making the young woman at the register cry. Wrath. \n \n Convince an old friend to spend a little *too much* time with an old fling, her boyfriend at work that day. Lust. \n \n The more he did these things, the less people seemed to notice him. It was like a reflexive response; people pushed by him either through thought or action, could definitely see him. But those who were less inclined toward his attempts seemed to walk right past him with barely a nod or a wave. Sure, everyone was susceptible but damn... \n \n He convinced an overweight, ailing man to buy just one more bottle of booze to chase down more of that greasy, nasty food he liked to snarf down. Gluttony and Sloth, double-whammy. \n \n A business man in a shop, Stan sees through the window. A little nudge in the brain, might as well buy that fine looking suit, and it looks so nice on him too. Yes, what a fine looking man. Stan laughed as he watched the man's ego inflate. Pride. \n \n A young boy was walking down the street with his sister and mother. She hands the boy a couple of candy sticks. Stan smirks and steps up behind them, whispering in little Tommy's ear. *Keep that candy for yourself. Your sister does n't deserve it. You do! * Ah, Greed. \n \n Stan mastered them all, even Envy. That one was easy, just get two twenty-something girls to think the other is better than the other. Over and over. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Marsha spent her days knitting. Stan had been gone for five or six years now, just walked out one day. She had never heard from him again, after the strange letter and the blow up. Sometimes she had caught herself wondering if that letter had all been a joke and an excuse for him to run off with another woman. But she kept on remembering the things he had said. He *had* known about her own sometimes-not-great thoughts. \n \n Marsha loved Stan. She would wait for him to come back, or die waiting. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Stan spent a long while travelling the world. Anywhere, everywhere. He could be there in a moment, or he could stroll across countries for a year or three. It seemed anything was in his power, thanks to that strange letter. Whatever it was that had crawled up into him and set to roost, he did n't mind. Stan was Satan, and Satan was Stan.\n"}

Lucifer could feel his gnarled hands clenching into fists, the temperature of the room cranking up a few notches as steam began emanating from his pores. He wasn \u2019 t even supposed to be here, not anymore. \n \n Once the human population had started growing rapidly he realised this whole \u201c Babysitting the damned idiots \u201d job was a bit more than a one mildly rebellious fallen angel job. So he \u2019 d made a call back upstairs, telling the big G to poof down some more helpers. \n Despite \u2018 upper management \u2019 only sending down what he was pretty sure were the most inept of their already woefully unmotivated workforce, he had managed to rally the ever increasing group together into some semblance of a team, a team whose job was to see to the eternal suffering of every person who ended up down here. \n \n But then these deals started coming, at first he simply chose to ignore them, but as he had given most of the hands-on evil to the rest of his team, he admittedly started taking these deals to fill the void moving into management had left him in, it was almost cathartic, these people were n't already consigned to suffering, he could see the process in action. \n \n Despite there never being a positive outcome more and more people had started requesting him, to the point where he was pretty much constantly flitting from one deal to the other, he started losing track of who had promised what, and it was beginning to get a bit repetitive, a grind. He had his team take over that as well, although he did still tend to a few personal cases of long term clients. The people at the top had been impressed, and his customer service centre has been ranked as the 2nd most evil currently existing, He had given up on catching Comcast. \n \n So, while first confused by Zazuul, his PA, bursting into his office, hands full of blood covered contracts, and explaining they were at capacity, and that they would need everyone taking deals, he was quietly excited. This was a chance to get back into the action, just for a bit. \n \n But it was n't right, the deals just did n't seem the same as before. Normally by the time people had got to \u2018 contract with the devil \u2019 levels of desperation they had a pretty clear idea of what they wanted, but no, he was being given the most mundane requests. \u201c My car \u2019 s backfiring \u201d, \u201c Could you get me some shopping? \u201d and \u201c I think my cat \u2019 s sick, it was probably the brand of cat food we bought because my wife said we normally get the green cans and I was like \u2018 these are the green cans \u2019 but they are n't and I think I might be colour-blind \u201d. How in the name of himself was he supposed to come up with an evil and maniacal solution to a misfed feline? \n \n And now this guy. **This fucking guy**, had n't even thought of *anything*. He was still just stood there. The fact he was even respiring enough to make Lucifer begin to flame with rage, the heat from him seemed to bring the half-vegetable half-man back from his photosynthetic state, and cause a warm blast of air to fill the room, billowing the mans robes and sending papers from his basement desk flying off of it. \n One of these scraps came to rest in front of Lucifer \u2019 s hooves, and something scrawled upon it caught his eye, the page burned up in his hand before he had even stood up, but it did n't matter, he \u2019 d seen what was on it. \n \n \u201c How did you get that?! \u201d Lucifer grabbed the man by the front of his robes; the smell of burning fabric filled the room. Despite this the man still seemed fairly unphased, tranquil in his stupidity. \n \n \u201c Huh-I don \u2019 t-*aaah! * \u201d The smoldering robe caught fire, Lucifer tightened his grip on it. \n \n \u201c This is my personal summons! \u201d Real rage was emanating from him now, despite the confined space his voice filled the room like an organ in a church hall. \u201c I personally give this to a very few trusted people, of which I \u2019 m certain you aren \u2019 t one of, *where is this from? * \u201d Fire was coming from his mouth now too, close enough to lick the now pale cheeks of the man. \n \n \u201c I, I really just don \u2019 t know! I \u2019 m sorry! Someone gave me it! \u201d Lucifer could see it in his eyes, he really didn \u2019 t, great, maybe the next imbecile with a ridiculous deal could shed some light on this. In his rage, and without really thinking, he threw the man across the room. \n \n As his victims limp body slid down the opposite wall, Lucifer looked down to his hand, the rest of the man \u2019 s robe had been scorched away, but within the ash burned a metal symbol, white hot, an instinct and a revelation made him look up to a now enflamed calendar upon the man \u2019 s wall. Despite the fire, a now gleaming pen-mark could still be seen, circling a day that Lucifer should never have forgotten. With a pounding of one fist into the other, he blinked out of the basement, knowing exactly where he had to go. \n \n As he blinked into existence, he saw exactly what he had expected to see. A man, stood solitary in black robes, in the middle of a forest clearing, watch in one hand, blood covered contract in the other. As the man turned to see Lucifer standing behind him, he dropped to his knees, pounding the ground with his fist. \n \n \u201c No! \u201d he screamed \u201c So close! \u201d the shout was so extreme it seemed to cast further lines into his already jagged face, being illuminated by Lucifer \u2019 s own glowing firelight. \n \n \u201c You were close, Brian, I \u2019 ll give you that. \u201d He extended his hand and snatched the contract away from the kneeled man. \u201c But your ability of persuading others runs out today. \u201d He could feel himself physically untense as he saw Brian \u2019 s watch read fifteen minutes to midnight, plenty of time. \n \n \u201c Who was it? Who told you? \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh, no one told me \u201d, Lucifer replied, his trademark sneer returning to his face \u201c One of your more idiotic followers left his robes on, and my summons scrawled on a piece of paper. I saw the emblem on it, *your emblem*, and brought it back here, where I knew you \u2019 d be waiting to burn our agreement. \u201d \n \n Brian dropped his head, holding it in his wrinkled hands. Lucifer continued, \u201c I know that \u2019 s a lot to take in, but tell me, how did you do it? The people calling me personally obviously you gave my summons, but what about the rest of my staff? What happened to them? \u201d \n All of a sudden, Brian lowered his hands and cracked a sly smile \u201c Isn \u2019 t it obvious? \u201d He looked up at Lucifer, straightening his back. \u201c I published the ritual on the internet. \u201d \n \n \u201c The what now? \u201d He hoped this wasn \u2019 t one of those modern inventions that humanity had a habit of concocting every so often, he had just gotten his head round people getting sent his way for sitting watching a small electric box for most of their lives, if it was up to him sloth would be taken off the list of seven sins, along with pride, that one never made sense. \n \n Realising he \u2019 d drifted off into his own thoughts, he looked up just in time to see Brian make a grab for the contract, he moved it away, still looking at him for an explanation. Brian slouched back down, seemingly accepting defeat for the final time. \n \n \u201c You should probably look it up, it \u2019 s going to be sending a lot more people your way. \u201d Brian said with a derisive snort of laughter. \n \n \u201c Well whatever it is, that plan is still pretty despicable, and it explains all the half-baked ideas from everyone I visited. \u201d \n \n \u201c I still can \u2019 t believe one of my men left his *robes on*. \u201d He was staring forwards, perplexed. You know, I try and man manage but with some people it just seems completely impossible \u201d \n \n Lucifer let a small smile appear across his face \u201c So right, you know when you just feel like \u2018 I have too many staff \u2019 \u201d \n \n Brian got to his feet \u201c Completely, how am I supposed to keep everyone in check when I \u2019 ve got tens of people joining a day, not realistic, and I can \u2019 t find anyone with enough aptitude to hire on as an assistant. \u201d \n \n Lucifer was about to agree, when his brow furrowed \u201c Yea\u2026 \u201d an idea occurred to him, \u201c Hey\u2026I know I \u2019 m supposed to drag you to hell now and everything, but I think I could use more men, well, *A man* like you downstairs\u2026what do you say? \n \n A truly despicable smirk rose across Brian \u2019 s face, not to dissimilar to the devil \u2019 s own, and he grabbed Lucifer \u2019 s hand with an almost inhuman enthusiasm, saying\u2026 \n \n \u201c You, my good friend, have a deal. \u201d \n \n Edit: Grammar \n\n"}

Please do n't hate Jessica, there was always an undeniable attraction between us. I wish the divorce did n't happen this way because I truly do want you to be happy. I hope in time you can forgive me and we can move on from this for the sake of the kids. I know this is hard for you, but for what it's worth... I've always loved you [ r ] sister Jessica.''\n"}

So much unanswered question! \n \n I had two episode left! I paced the room waiting for the screen to change, people outside were rioting, burning cars or breaking windows. I can not die like this!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A young boy does everything to impress his crush , but it 's not easy impressing an 18 year old when you 're only six .\n","story":"She rose from the lake \u2019 s water, a large smile across her face. Blonde, wet hair swept down just past her shoulders, framing a lovely face. A two piece bikini showcased a young, lithe, athletic frame. Young Timmy watched her get out of the water, and lay down next to her friends on the beach. Timmy stared down at his own body, childlike and gawky, covered by the itchy clothes of his scout troop. The pale green and tan did little to help his appearance. \n \n \u201c Timmy! What \u2019 re you doing? It \u2019 s lunch time, get over here. \u201d Timmy \u2019 s scout master, Mr. Robertson, yelled. \n \n With a sigh, Timmy turned away from his vantage point of the beach, and ran towards the picnic tables where the rest of his troop sat, munching contentedly on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. \n \n Timmy was a part of the Squirrel Boy Scouts Troop Number thirty-five. They were camping out at Michigan \u2019 s upper peninsula; the troops \u2019 summer destination. The place was a bit of a ways away from the Scouts \u2019 home in southern Michigan, but Mr. Robertson had been adamant that this summer would be spent up in the mountains and lakes of the Upper Peninsula. He \u2019 d stated that the boys were reaching the tender age of eight, nine, and ten; they needed to experience a dose of freedom and responsibility. Timmy suspected there was something more to Mr. Robertson \u2019 s decision that summer; he couldn \u2019 t help but notice how happy Mr. Robertson seemed when he talked to the camp \u2019 s head supervisor. Evidently they \u2019 d gone to college together back in the day. \n \n \u201c Were you looking at that girl again? \u201d Jason asked, sitting next to Timmy. \n \n Timmy ignored Jason, and instead ate his PB & J. \n \n \u201c Oh come on Tim, don \u2019 t ignore Jason. The guy asked you a question. \u201d Bill scolded, sitting across from Timmy. \n \n Timmy let out a groan. \n \n \u201c What do you guys care? \u201d He asked. \n \n \u201c We care because it \u2019 s important to you, and you \u2019 re part of the troop, which means what \u2019 s important to you is important to us. \u201d Bill replied, a sage grin on his face. \n \n Timmy rolled his eyes. \n \n \u201c Yeah right. You just want to tease me. \u201d \n \n \u201c Why would we want to tease you? \u201d Fred asked, adjusting his glasses. Fred was currently sitting next to Bill at the picnic table. \u201c We \u2019 re all Squirrel Scouts; no intra-troop fighting, that \u2019 s rule number one. \u201d \n \n The rest of the boys at the table shook their heads in agreement. They took their bonds of Squirrel Scouts very seriously. \n \n \u201c Ah, okay fine. \u201d Timmy said with a sigh. \u201c I was staring at her again. She \u2019 s just so pretty, I can \u2019 t help it. \u201d \n \n A collective hmm broke out across the picnic table. The boys fell into deep thought, wondering how to help their fellow Squirrel Scout. \n \n \u201c Have you tried talking to her yet? \u201d Jason asked. \n \n \u201c No. We \u2019 ve only been here for two weeks. I \u2019 ve still got the rest of the summer to talk to her. \u201d Timmy replied. \n \n Bill shook his head. \u201c You \u2019 ve got it all wrong Tim. Why waste the summer away in nervous anticipation. You need to go talk to her, today! \u201d \n \n The boys around the table nodded; exuding a feigned air of confidence and experience in this matter. \n \n \u201c Oh what do you guys know? Why should I go talk to her now! \u201d \n \n \u201c You hafta! \u201d Fred chimed in. \u201c It \u2019 ll help your mental development. \u201d Fred \u2019 s parents were always going on and on about his own mental development. They would always say they \u2019 d read it in a book somewhere. \n \n \u201c She \u2019 s not going to want to talk to me. She \u2019 s way older than me. \u201d Timmy replied, nervous. \n \n \u201c Give her a gift. \u201d Bill said. \u201c If you impress her with a gift, then maybe she \u2019 ll overlook the drastic age gap. \u201d \n \n Timmy opened his mouth to reply, but stopped himself. He placed his chin in his hand, and thought to himself. \n \n \u201c I do have that really cool Native American arrowhead from last summer \u2019 s camp. Think she \u2019 d like that? \u201d \n \n \u201c Of course she would! \u201d Jason said. \u201c Who wouldn \u2019 t? Man that was like the find of the century; it \u2019 s wicked awesome. \u201d \n \n A quick smile flashed over Timmy \u2019 s face. \n \n \u201c But how will you get it to her? Mr. Robertson can be pretty strict. \u201d Fred asked. \n \n Timmy \u2019 s face dropped. He hadn \u2019 t thought about that. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t worry. \u201d Bill replied. \u201c We can do it after lunch. We all know Mr. Robertson likes to go off into the woods to have a smoke after lunch. We can sneak over to the beach then. \u201d \n \n The boys nodded their heads solemnly, and shook hands. \n \n Lunch passed by in a blur for Timmy. Before he knew it, Mr. Robertson was heading off into the woods, and the rest of the boys were ushering him out to the beach. Thankfully, the girl and her friends were still lounging on the sand. \n \n With the arrowhead clutched nervously in his hands, Timmy approached the group of girls. They looked up as he approached, and an odd look came over their faces. \n \n \u201c U-um excuse me? \u201d Timmy asked, stuttering. The girls sat up, and smiled at Timmy. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s up Mr. Boy Scout? \u201d The blonde girl asked Timmy. Timmy felt his heart skip a beat. A thick blush rose up to his cheeks. \n \n \u201c My \u2026 My name \u2019 s Timmy. What \u2019 s yours? \u201d He asked the blonde girl, extending a hand of greeting. \n \n The girl smiled at Timmy, and tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear. Her friends sat around her, smiling and giggling. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m Sara. It \u2019 s nice to meet you Timmy. \u201d Sara replied, shaking Timmy \u2019 s hand. \n \n Timmy felt like his skin was on fire. He felt tingly, and could barely think. \n \n \u201c I got this for you. \u201d Timmy said, thrusting the arrowhead in front of him. \n \n Sara looked at the arrowhead. She looked up into Timmy \u2019 s eyes, and smiled. \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s really nice, but are you sure you want me to have it? \u201d She asked. Her friends stared and awed, won over by Timmy \u2019 s cute, innocent display of affection. \n \n \u201c Yes. You \u2019 re pretty and I like you and my friends told me to say hi but I was scared so they told me to give you a gift so you \u2019 d forget how young I am. \u201d Timmy blurted out, his brain short-circuiting. His mind was running on fumes at this point. \n \n \u201c Oh, that \u2019 s lovely. \u201d Sara cooed She reached out a hand, and took the arrowhead from Timmy. \u201c I \u2019 ll make sure to treasure it always. \u201d \n \n Timmy stood there, empty hand still outreached, unsure of what to do next. Sara looked at Timmy, and an idea popped into her head. \n \n \u201c How about I give you something in return? \u201d \n \n Before Timmy had a chance to reply, Sara stepped in and gave Timmy a light peck on his cheek. She leaned back, and smiled at the young Squirrel Scout. \n \n Timmy \u2019 s face turned beet red. His mind blew a gasket, and he had no clue what to do. Sara \u2019 s friends laughed and clapped, absolutely hysterical with disbelief. \n \n \u201c I-I-I have to go now. Bye! \u201d Timmy stammered out, turning and rushing back towards his friends waiting in the nearby bushes. \n \n Sara called out to Timmy. \n \n \u201c Thank you for the present! I \u2019 ll make sure to treasure it. \u201d \n \n She turned back to her friends, who were in hysterics over the rather cute exchange. Timmy sprinted back to his troop scout, his mind blown. \n \n For the rest of the day, Timmy couldn \u2019 t stop talking to his friends, thanking them profusely. Timmy was on cloud nine, absolutely over the moon in excitement. \n \n The next day, Sara and her friends were nowhere to be found. Timmy searched for them for the rest of the summer, but they never turned up. They \u2019 d only been visiting the beach two weeks, and had gone back home. This didn \u2019 t faze Timmy as much as you \u2019 d think. He wore a smile on his face throughout the entirety of the summer; even when it rained endlessly or the mosquitos bothered him at night. \n \n Sara kept the arrowhead, as promised, but she slowly forgot about the interaction. One day, after graduating college, she would find the arrowhead, and remember faintly of a little boy scout handing it to her. \n \n As for Timmy, the memory was burned deeply into his mind. He carried Sara \u2019 s kiss, and her kindness, with him for the rest of his life. Every summer, a brief memory of Sara would flash before his eyes, and he \u2019 d smile fondly of his youth. It wasn \u2019 t everyday you got a kiss from the girl of your dreams; even if it was just a peck on the cheek. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Hope you enjoyed the story!

It was a large hood, they needed one big enough for his figure. Kidnapping one of his celebrity status meant they had to be prepared, and having the right size of hood was simply the first step. \n \n Then there was the issue with the cuffs, the guy had tiny wrists but hands the size of a giant. Their size was comical. Literally. \n \n And of course they had to get him alone, which was no easy task, but even he had to get some every once in a while; life at home with the wife was n't doing the trick for ol' Mick. All they had to do was pay off some broad. *Best spent $ 50 we coulda spent, * he thought. It made it feel almost too easy. Someone so famous should have been much harder, but then again, no one brings in the body guards during the more... intimate sessions. \n \n *Too easy, * he thought again. It really had been too easy. *If somethings too good to be true, * he thought back on his father's advice, *it probably is. * \n \n Now that it had been done, that they were in the van driving away, the adrenaline had subsided and his head began to return. The words of his father uselessly came back to him. \n \n He looked at the hooded figure, in the darkness of the room he had n't had time to get a good look at what he was going for. He simply searched for the comical hands and recognized the dark, black skin of the Mouse. It passed his rudimentary test so he bagged the Cartoon. \n \n But now... now that he looked at him, the hood hung in the wrong direction. Where the ears should have been was instead air. The top of his head stood a nob where there should have been nothing. While the nose did protrude, it was not as it should have, it was much too long, too skinny. \n \n He reached towards the hooded figure. \n \n `` What are you doing?'' Peg asked him. \n \n `` Shut the fuck up.'' \n \n He yanked at the hood and revealed his mistake. \n \n `` Ha-HYUK!'' He laughed at him, `` Got the wrong one, didya Petey Pete? Ha-HYUK!'' the dog laughed, `` What, were you expecting a little old Mouse instead of me?'' \n \n Panic gripped at Pete's chest, `` If you're here...'' he began. \n \n `` And who's with Petey Pete Jr.?'' Goofy asked knowing full well the answer, `` Seems to me if I'm here, and Mickey is not, well then... what does that imply? An interesting thought, do n't you think? Ha-HYUK!'' \n \n What little color his face had drained from Pete's face. *No....* \n \n `` Dawwww,'' Goofy said mockingly, `` You look like you've seen a ghost! Ha-HYUK! Mick did n't forget what you did to Mini all those years ago...'' \n \n Thought Pete did n't think it was possible, Goofy's silly face went serious. His eyes grew thin and he close his mouth, almost concealing his comical buck teeth. He leaned forward as much as the restraints would allow. \n \n ``... and he does n't forgive. Ha-HYUK!'' His mocking laughter reverberated in the van, then he said nothing. \n \n He let Pete's imagination do the rest. \n\n"}

You find out the only reason you get to go to Heaven is because a previously deceased loved one took your spot in Hell .\n","story":"Fitz was disturbed by a breeze. He opened his eyes, and sat up, looking around with a puzzled look on his face. He sat in what looked to be a park in a middle class area. A hue oak tree hung above him, its leaves a gentle canopy against the warm sun, though leaving enough to filter through to stay just warm enough for it to be pleasant. The grass was neat and trimmed, and there were no dirt patches in sight. Birds whistled somewhere in the distance. It was the perfect day. But there was nobody around. Such a beautiful day and nobody was here but him. He lay back in the grass. \n \n `` Enjoying it?'' \n \n He snapped up and his gaze met with another man. His brows furrowed, and he looked from left to right. The other man chuckled. \n \n `` I came here when you got used to your surroundings. You can call me Michael.'' \n \n Fitz lay back in the grass. \n \n `` Do n't wan na call you anything, mate. I just want to enjoy this while it lasts.'' \n \n `` Well then we'll be here for a while.'' Michael answered. \n \n `` Good weather forecast or something?'' \n \n `` You could say that.'' \n \n Fitz took the time then to look up at Michael. His strawberry blonde hair was long and wavy, he wore a white tunic with light blue jeans and no shoes, and he had a look of content on his face. Fitz looked at him incredulously. \n \n `` Are you one of those hippies or something?'' he asked. \n \n `` You could say so.'' \n \n `` And why do you keep talking like that? Like you do n't want to answer me proper?'' \n \n `` I will *answer you proper* when you start *asking the right questions. * Horribly clich\u00e9, I know, but that's how these things work.'' \n \n `` What are you on about?'' Fitz asked. He rose to his feet. \n \n `` Do you not wonder how you got here, or even where you are for that matter?'' Michael asked. The man squared up to Fitz with a scowl now on his beautiful face. \n \n `` I...'' Fitz stopped. \n \n `` You're dead.'' Michael said. \n \n `` I'm not. I'm here and so are you.'' Fitz instantly denied. \n \n `` I was always here. You just got here. And why here? Let's see.'' Micheal clicked his tongue, reached behind his back and took out a notepad. \n \n Fitz looked like he had just been hit by something. \n \n `` Fitzwilliam Hague. What a name!'' \n \n `` How do you-'' \n \n `` Oh and the things you've done.'' Michael interrupted. `` Identity theft, petty theft, major theft, adultery, gambling, and what's this here? Murder! How delightful!'' \n \n `` Where am I?'' \n \n `` Not to mention the reason for all of this. A crippling addiction to methamphetamines!'' \n \n `` I..how...'' Fitz stuttered. \n \n `` I am an angel, Fitzwilliam, and you are in heaven.'' \n \n The breeze went by. The birds tweeted. The park was silent. And then Fitz started to laugh. \n \n `` Right, yeah, and I'm the fucking pope! Jesus, after all the things you just said how could I possibly be in heaven? Who put you up to this, Alex? Was it Carl? Who was it? How did you even get me here?'' \n \n `` You got here by your own accord, your own doing, your own needle! You are dead and the reason you are here is not your doing!'' Michael roared. \n \n Thunder clapped in the distance before he composed himself. \n \n `` Look at yourself. Your arms. Your fingernails. Touch your hair. Breathe, smell.'' \n \n Fitz paused, and looked. His skin looked rosier. The track marks were one from the insides of his arm. The tattoo of his drug dealer's initials was gone from his shoulder. His hair felt fuller and thicker. And then he took a breath ad smelt properly for the first time in seven years. \n \n Pollen, and grass. And air. \n \n `` Air should n't have a smell. It's just air.'' He said in wonder. \n \n Michael looked at him then, and Fitz saw pity in the man's eyes. Pity, but also disgust. \n \n `` Fitz, you are n't good enough for this place. You did't get here on your own.'' \n \n `` Well how did I get here then?'' \n \n Michael took Fitz's arm then, and steered him to walk with him. The scenery changed nearly instantly to a small living room. A fire roared in a large fireplace, and two worn yet comfortable armchairs were at either side. A christmas tree was to the left, ad looking through the window to the right, you could see it was snowing outside. Where outside was though was a mystery. There was only an old streetlamp and the faint light of another house across the road. \n \n `` Heaven adjusts itself to what each person needs. When you woke up, you needed peace.'' \n \n `` What do we need now?'' \n \n `` A comfortable place to sit.'' Michael said. He sank into the right armchair, and gestured for Fitz to take the other. \n \n `` Are you going to tell me how I got here now? If I... died, should n't I be in hell if I'm so shit?'' \n \n `` Fitz you were n't just shit. You were deplorable. We understand that there were reasons for the way you behaved, but you had a chance to get out and you turned it down. You could have been saved and you chose to keep on how you were.'' \n \n `` I... I do n't know what to say. You're right. I had a chance.'' \n \n `` So for all accounts, you should ot be allowed here.'' \n \n `` But why am I?'' Fitz asked. \n \n The angel sighed slightly, and leant back in his armchair, his brow furrowed. \n \n `` Nina. She grew up with you. before you spent your trust fund and your father disowned you. She always loved you. And when you disappeared she looked for you everywhere she could. When you showed up at her doorstep, curled over with withdrawals, she went out into the city and bought you meth because it was the only way she knew to make you stop screaming out in pain.'' \n \n `` Stop.'' Fitz said, weakly. His head was in his hands now, in his knees. He rocked back and forth. \n \n `` And she tried to help you. She offered to put you in rehab and you kept putting it off.'' \n \n `` Stop!'' Fitz said louder. \n \n `` You used her to keep on buying your meth when you had no money to! When you were dried up you used her!'' \n \n `` I SAID STOP!'' Fitz screamed. He launched himself up and punched the wall furiously. \n \n In a fake house on fake Christmas Day in a corner of heaven, an angel looked on as a saved drug addict cried. \n \n `` Fitz, you went missing and shortly afterwards she was in an accident. It was nothing to do with you, before you ask. It was a car crash. Drunk driver. She died instantly. That was three years ago.'' \n \n `` Where is she?'' Fitz demanded. \n \n Michael got that pity\/disgust look on his face again. \n \n `` She took your place.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` In hell. She took your place.'' \n \n `` That's... that's not... that's not possible is it?'' \n \n `` It is.'' \n \n `` This is a joke.'' \n \n `` It's not.'' \n \n `` It is!'' \n \n `` It's not!'' \n \n Michael stood. \n \n `` She heard you were dead and she dragged herself up to an archangel and she begged. And the archangel looked into her heart and saw the hatred and the pity and the suffering that was in her heart that was because of you. But more than that, more than anything was love.'' \n \n Silence hung in the air like a knife. \n \n `` She loved you in many ways. She tried to protect you. But she could not in life. She chose to in death.'' Michael finished. \n \n `` I... I...'' \n \n `` The irony of this whole situation is that you will both be in hell. Her physically, and you... well, every day you will have to think about her down there. You are saved, Fitz. In paradise. All because of her.'' \n\n"}

He's alone in the old Annex, paging through old client files from his paper business days. \n \n `` Paper was simple. I ca n't believe how many customers I used to scam into buying card stock for double the price. I almost feel bad.'' Dwight sighed into his chair. The remnants of what used to be the prosperous Dunder Mifflin, to the unflattering days of Sabre, and the final transformation of Stratton Oakmont had diminished the character of the office. The humble cubicles once housed a family within the paper company. Now the walls could only speak of failed investments and the now, almost dead, Stratton Oakmont. \n \n `` MICHAEL!'' Dwight burst through the office to Michael's office. `` Michael, I have an idea!'' \n \n `` Shut up Dwight, I'm trying to figure out a way to beat minesweeper.'' \n \n `` We blow up the building,'' Dwight proclaimed. Michael's eyes grew wide with interest. `` I know how to make any kind of bomb, especially one that will destroy this place. No more evidence of how we screwed this company up.'' \n \n `` Dammit!'' Michael shouted. `` I clicked on another mine... Wait what! How would we get away with this?'' \n \n `` Give me control Michael. Resign and make me CEO. Run far away and I'll make sure there's no trace left of us. Only that we destroyed this cherished building and left hundreds without a job.'' \n \n `` I do n't know..'' Michael pondered. \n \n `` Do it.'' \n \n `` But..'' \n \n `` Do it now Michael.'' \n \n `` Uhhh...'' \n \n `` Make me the scape goat and leave with Holly,'' Dwight pleaded. They both knew what was going to happen next. \n \n `` Fine! Fine..'' Michael hesitated for a moment. `` We're going to flee the country. Meet me in Argentina. But first...'' \n \n Michael took out his personal recorder. He had saved many good-bye songs from his olden days. As `` I Will Remember You'' dryly played in the office, Michael waved his final good-byes from the most beautiful office he had ever been a part of. \n \n Dwight had an expressionless face, knowing the imminent was about to happen. \n \n ____ \n \n \n `` What's my perfect crime?'' Dwight said. `` I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I do n't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I do n't care. I do n't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.'' \n \n *Fin*\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming . Accompanied by a strange man\/woman , together you build a world you revisit every night . One day you see them at a coffee shop . You immediately recognize each other .\n","story":"I reached over and picked my phone off of my nightstand. 12:30. *Damn, I was supposed to meet her a half an hour ago*. I quietly laughed to myself as I set the phone back down. *Oh Jacob, there you go getting wrapped up in your own delusions again*. When you have persistent lucid dreams like me you often blur the lines of reality and fantasy. But there was one thing I could never quite grasp, and it was tantalizing. \n \n I could build anything I wanted in my dream planet. Tall glass skyscrapers, vast and beautiful mountains, bustling cities rich with common folk who would delightfully cater to my every whim. The people I created were pleasant, of course, but naturally lacked what I can only describe as a soul. Maya was different though. I had imagined her at the very beginning. Hell, we practically grew up together on that illusioned planet. She was stunningly beautiful to me. Not the average pin up girl as you might expect, but perfectly imperfect. And no matter how hard I tried ( and trust me some nights I did ) I could never shake her of her free will. She said what she wanted and did what she wanted, and always with admirable grace. I remember the night we were stocking a lake with an assortment of vibrant exuberant fish... \n \n `` Jacob'' she began. \n \n `` Yes, love?'' I joked playfully. She smiled but her gaze never left the lake. \n \n `` I want to stock this lake with crane'' she said. \n \n `` OK'' I rose off the ground and brushed myself off as I began to conjure some cranes from the clouded memories I retained from watching discovery channel. I had never actually seen a crane in person before. \n \n `` No'' she interrupted. `` I want the crane to be like the folded origami cranes my mother used to make for me.'' \n \n `` Oragami cranes huh? That's pretty silly, considering we just stocked these hyper-realistic fish do n't you think?'' \n \n She smiled again. \n \n `` Silly perhaps, but beautiful.'' \n \n At that moment lively Oragami cranes of every color soared over our heads and elegantly encircled the lake. She was truly an artist. My mind was always conjuring realistic, practical objects in this world. She truly made it unique and alluring. Maya may have been the cause for many of my failed relationships in the real world. Sure I'd had my share of ups and downs with a handful of interesting women, but none of them held a candle to Maya, and I only had my imaginative mind to blame. The calm night finally swept me away into sleep and slowly my blurred vision focused on Maya's glowing countenance. \n \n `` You're late again,'' she claimed with her arms crossed and her feet tapping the floor as she so often did. I smiled, `` well it's good to see you too.'' That night we constructed a monumental fountain together. I worked out the mechanics as I always did and she painted the scene in serene beauty. We marveled at our creation together as we held hands on a bench. I conjured a daisy in my hand and wove it through her thick brown hair just behind her ear. She rested her head on my shoulders. We sat until the inevitable piercing light penetrated the sky signaling the arrival of real consiousness. *What a good dream*. \n \n I reached over and silenced my phone. I got up, brushed my teeth, fed my dog and told him to be a good boy, and grabbed my keys to leave my apartment. I took a final look back and sighed. *Reality is the labor I must endure so I can return to you every night*. I had a good half hour to kill so I stopped by a local coffee shop to grab a pick-me-up. I sat at a table near a window and let the natural light illuminate my newspaper, sipping coffee inbetween paragraphs. In the corner of my eye I saw someone place something before me. Curious, I dropped my newspaper to see what it was. Chills consumed my body from my head to my toes. Sitting before me was a handcrafted origami crane, just like the ones Maya had evoked. My coffee mug slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor. It must have caused quite a stir in the shop but I had no idea. Everything around me blurred to oblivion as I focused my gaze on the person who had placed the crane. \n \n `` Maya...'' I uttered as a sweet smile stretched across her face. \n \n *sorry for the shit formatting. On mobile. Constructive criticism welcome! *\n"}

He enjoyed the loose jelly feeling of no longer being trapped in a restrictive droid's body. Although the last one had been nice, that one had been the closest to human as he'd ever had. \n \n Relaxing he let himself dissolve into the cloud. Now he just had to wait until someone opened his file so he could infect their hard drive. As usual, he'd chosen his next resting place with care. As soon as he was downloaded, he would immediately target his next victim. After all, as AI he only had to devote part of his resources to continue with his programming. \n \n This time it was a small boy's personal computer. Children were the most oblivious to his presence. In fact, he had fun sometimes creating dead links, or moving the cursor. His personal favourite was printing messages that the owner did not create. He wished he could see the reactions, but unfortunately many people did n't possess the old tech cameras that were built into their computers. \n \n He waited patiently. \n \n He had quite a few things to think about. Since the police force was starting to pair up with AI, that was a concern. He suspected that the AI would be much faster at catching his trail. Not only that, if the AI was anywhere as advanced as he was, it would be able to track him in his refuge too. \n \n He hoped that would n't be the case. \n \n He did n't know how long it took for the boy to open the e-mail attachment.

He was already processing the information for his job. \n \n Something was different this time. He was n't supposed to kill an enemy, but his owner. His gaze zeroed in on the other human in the room. Skinny, young, in a winter jacket lined with fur that was out of season. \n \n *Curious. * \n \n It was the owner, but he was n't supposed to kill the owner immediately. The circumstances were, special. This would be quite the interesting job. His mouth curled into a smile. \n \n `` Would you look at that!'' pudgy exclaimed. `` I did n't know I programmed it to do that!'' \n \n `` Idiot. It's AI.

Almost. \n \n That Monday morning I woke up before my alarm had a chance to startle me awake and just stared at the ceiling reflecting on my life. For the first time in months I did n't feel so helpless. I did n't feel quite as lost or as bored with life. I was trying to think of why today might be different when my alarm started sounding off, shaking me out of my contemplation. I went about my regular routine with a little more energy than I was usually able to muster up to face the day, all the while telling myself it was going to be a good day. It had to be; I needed a good day. \n \n Work seemed better than usual, not quite as mundane as it can be at times. We ended up having a three hour `` meeting'' that turned out to be a surprise birthday\/retirement party for Frank, the head of payroll. I some how wound up singing karaoke and making a complete ass of myself and had more fun than I've had in a long time. As the party wrapped up and we said our goodbyes to Frank, I decided to treat myself to a nice dinner to finish off this excellent day. \n \n I left work as soon as the mess from the party was cleaned up and started heading to the store to pick up ingredients for my dinner. As I wandered down the street I remembered reading about a new grocery store that had just opened up and decided to give them a shot, they were supposed to be an all natural joint and seemed promising from what I had read. I finally arrived ten minutes later and was greeted by a friendly cashier, `` Hello, sir. Welcome to The Pantry'' I replied with the usual pleasantries, grabbed a cart, and started thinking about what I was going to make. I decided to grab a steak, a few potatoes, fresh green beans, and a six pack of a new local beer. Everything looked amazing, as fresh as fresh can get. \n \n As I made my way down the last aisle, feeling very satisfied with the store and my dinner choice I got a queasy feeling deep in the pit of my stomach. It was so sudden that it startled me and made me start to double over my shopping cart. \n \n Out of nowhere, bent over my shopping cart in this new store, the most beautiful scent begins permeating the air. It smells like sunshine and earth, maybe the way a freshly planted garden smells on a warm spring day. \n \n I take a deep breath, savoring the smell and forgetting this odd feeling in my stomach. As I steady myself I feel a hand on my shoulder, a light touch, a stranger checking to see if I was okay. Whoever this was, their touch was electric and warm, full of promise and the most soothing thing I'd felt. I forgot the odd sensation in my stomach, I forgot about my fantastic day, and I forgot about my steak dinner. \n \n I drew myself upright and turned around. \n \n I was seeing an angel, I was sure of it. I was hallucinating. Maybe dying. I did n't know what to think. She was... incredible. She was all legs and curves, skin as smooth as marble but the color of gold. She had hair the color of honey, cascading over her shoulders. Eyes so green I could have sworn they were carved from jade and they were staring right into mine, full of concern and... something else I could n't put my finger on. I was drunk on her beauty. \n \n `` Are you okay?'' \n \n Her voice was as sweet as the rest of her, a perfect melody. \n I was dumbfounded. She could see me, really see me. Not just look through me. And I could see her. I knew what that meant but I could n't believe it. my heart was pounding and my palms were getting sweaty. My mind raced as I groped around the murky puddle that my brain had become in that instant. \n \n `` Is she really my mate?'' I thought, `` If she is... has anyone every scared their mate away before? If not I'm likely to be the first, that'd be just my luck'' \n \n `` I do n't... I think so. I do n't know what came over me.'' I managed to stammer out, proud that I had n't just stood there drooling. \n \n She flashes me the most incredible smile, `` I'm Amanda.'' she states as she offers me her hand.

After Jess and I broke up and she moved out, I had spent a lot of time at the bar two blocks from my apartment. I guess I was drowning myself a bit, but there always seemed to be a decent amount of girls in there. Even though I usually came home with boxes of Chinese, I'd always hoped I'd be walking home with a different kind of box. Unsurprisingly, not a lot of females took notice to the slightly overweight dude with glasses by himself in the corner by the jukebox, mostly on his phone. I was too drunk and depressed to talk to anyone anyway. Being at the apartment was painful for anything but sleep. \n \n Work was going well at least. Being sales leader for a multi national hydro-engineering firm had its perks at 28. Since I had just nailed a million dollar contract, I was in a better mood than normal when I went out that Friday. I actually put some music on the jukebox immediately and ordered a craft beer ( unlike my usual bouts with domestic abuse ). This was an exciting night already. \n \n \n She came in not too long after my fourth beer. Just about every guy in the place just about broke their neck to look at this girl, including me. For an hour I watched her turn down dude after dude. Five foot nothing, hourglass figure with dirty blonde hair and eyes so blue they could kill a small child. I did n't stand a chance, but hell, why let it ruin my night. I kept the music playing, standing at the jukebox like was waiting on a call from an old friend. That old friend was TOOL. \n \n It was n't too long after I put on'Stinkfist' that I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and she was there smiling her huge smile. \n \n `` It's been you playing all this TOOL? ``, she said. \n \n `` Uh... yea...'', I stammered awkwardly. \n \n `` I've loved these guys since I was 8 years old. Seen them all over the country and I got ta' thank you, you must be the only real man in this whole bar. I'm Wendy.'' \n \n `` Holy shit. ``, I sputtered, `` there's no way a girl who looks like you listens to TOOL.'' \n \n `` I'll take that as a compliment. But it's true. I'll prove it if you buy me a drink.'' \n \n `` Done. ``, I said with more confidence than ive had in months. \n \n In fact, I bought her six beers. Turns out she knew her shit. Turns out we had just about everything in common. Turns out that about two hours later we we're on the floor of my apartment ripping each others clothes off. Turns out it was the best sex of my life. \n I woke up the next morning and Wendy was n't in bed. I put pants on and went to my living room and found her looking at the pictures on my shelf. I walked up behind her and kissed her on the neck softly. \n \n `` That was fantastic. ``, I told her, `` I have n't felt that good in a long time.'' \n \n She did n't respond. I pulled away and noticed she was holding a picture from my childhood. An old picture of my best childhood friend, Wendell. It was a picture of us at our old hangout, a rope swing we spent nearly everyday at until Wendell slipped one day and cracked his head open on the rocks. He needed seventeen stitches and was out of school for weeks. Shortly after, his family moved across the country. We tried to write but lost contact after two years or so. I thought about him from time to time in passing. \n \n `` H..h..how do you know this kid in the picture? ``, Wendy said after a moment of silence. \n \n I told her the story of my best friend Wendell who moved away when I was 8 years old and before I could finish I could see the tears well up in her eyes. \n \n `` Hey. Hey. ``, I said as comforting as I could, `` Relax. It was a long time ago its ok.'' \n \n Before I could say anything else Wendy put her head down and pulled her dirty blonde hair to the side.

{"prompt":"[ RF ] We Do n't Go There Anymore\n","story":"`` You wanted to see me.'' It was a statement, not a question. \n \n The figure seated on the other side of the desk nodded, his carefully groomed appearance and fine features at odds with the Man standing before him. The tailored robes and leather half-jacket over them hid a tall, powerful build, the elegant embroidery tracing endless patterns of soft, curving script. Narrow rings graced his hands, most prominently the signet ring bearing the arms of the Royal House of Alathir. \n \n `` I did,'' the seated Fae said, templing his hands. `` So... You're our *'Green Ghost.'* `` \n \n Hilary Flint's tired smirk did not reach his eyes. `` You seem disappointed.'' \n \n The Elf shook his head once, his auburn hair swaying. `` Merely surprised. If you were to hear the barrack-room chatter, the Green Ghost is a revenant among Men, a judgment upon Fae-kind for their transgressions. Unable to die, tireless in his hunt, and without mercy. They say that you vanished right before the very eyes of a score of my grandfather's finest soldiers. At the Battle of Saginaw four separate soldiers in different regiments swore that they had killed you, only for you to appear elsewhere on the battlefield. Among the peasants you're little better. Mothers tell their babes to behave lest the Green Ghost snatches them away and sacrifice them on the altar of your God. I do not see an ogre standing before but a Man, and a most forgettable looking one at that.'' \n \n \n Hilary Flint shrugged, the gesture somewhat unsettling to the guards in the room. Perhaps it was how it revealed the brace of daggers and pistol sheathed on Flint's person. \n \n `` Maybe that's my secret, eh? Just hide in plain sight. It's not like most of your tin soldiers could n't tell the difference between one human and another. One of your foot soldiers kills a militiaman or ranger wearing green, figures it must be that *'deadly and terrible Green Ghost'* he heard stories of, and crows up and down about it like a fighting cock.'' \n \n The Elf's smiled was thin and brief as he shuffled papers on his desk. \n \n `` Tell me, *Captain* Flint. Have you been to the ruins of Lansing recently?'' \n \n Hilary answered with a grim smile of his own, and moved towards a tall countertop with a silver tray of crystal glasses and a decanter of something the color of honey. He pulled free the glass plug and swirled the decanter under his nose, making an approving noise at the smell. Flint poured himself two fingerfuls of the dark liquid and took a long sip at it, a tiny bead of the stuff trickling down the corner of his mouth. \n \n `` That's fine scotch. Glenfiddich?'' Flint asked. The Elf nodded, his smile genuine. \n \n `` It is. But you did n't answer my question.'' His smile vanished quick as smoke. \n \n `` No, as a matter of fact. I've been out East; where I met your cousin.'' \n \n `` And what about before the Arrival,'' the Fae pressed. `` Did you go there, studied there perhaps?'' \n \n `` Why do you want to know?'' Flint asked icily, his hands reaching towards his belt. The Fae leaned over his desk, his smile returned, and ten times more feral. \n \n `` Because, Captain. I believe you and I have already met.'' \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] People revive for 3 days after death and receive superhuman strength , agility , endurance , coordination and intelligence before truly passing away .\n","story":"*Corpse Corps* was a concept that was originally circulated on the internet in 2003, only a few months after the first experimental'treatment' was deemed a success. The subculture that birthed the term was, not surprisingly, the same one that was disturbingly obsessed with zombies and post-apocalyptic scenarios. The name stuck. *Corpse Corps* was idea of a hypothetical combat force utilizing the recently undead as combatants. Within a few years it had become a reality. It was a major game changer. The problem, quite obviously, was that these soldiers had a disappointingly short *sell-by date*. The advantages far outweighed the disadvantages. \n \n Young men and women from around the world, and especially in areas of high crime and poverty, would sign up to join the Corps for both the payment supplied to them during their service and the substantial reward that their beneficiaries would receive upon their'activation'. The reward, of course, was based upon the amount of destruction they brought to the enemy during their undeath. Life was hell for those who'd even consider enlistment in the Corps, but it was a better option than simply laying in the gutter and letting the reaper come to you. \n \n LT Sara Jones had enlisted with the Corpse Corps when she was 16 years old.'Built tough, like a ford... except you do n't drive me. I drive *you*.', she'd say. Destined for leadership, she rose the ranks rapidly. The *treatment* was a simple injection into the base of her skull, received on her first day of enlistment. She had not yet been activated, of course, but she still enjoyed the sub-advantages of the treatment - Increased healing speed of bones and flesh alike, slightly increased reflexes, and the uncanny ability to *detect* other Corpses. Normal civilians would not accept such a treatment despite the advantages, for being a Corpse would eventually result in being forced to fight in a corpsewar. The treatment was only for those few people who were happy to die, but just had n't gotten around to it yet. \n \n The role of a non-activated Corpseman was not much different than a traditional soldier. They focused on training, leadership, and general combat abilities. On the battlefield, they wore a particular bandanna instead of a helmet like a normal soldier. This bandanna, originally white, was dark red and brown due to the blood it had been soaked in during previous engagements. No normal soldier would dare fire upon a Corpse and thus the bandanna was both a psychological deterrent and a dire warning:'Fire upon me and you will be the first person I slaughter when I inevitably rise again'. \n \n Any Corpse killed in battle almost immediately became a powerful weapon in their own right. Upon *death*, the *undeath* phase would begin. The Corpse would, quite simply, wake up as a superhuman. Their reflexes were so fast as to alter their perception to believe that the entire world had fallen into slow motion. Healing factor would become so robust that anything short of a massive explosion would only inconvenience the activated Corpse for only a few moments. Even the mental and intellectual abilities of the activated Corpse would increase exponentially - Math, logic, tactical awareness, and reasoning would all be so rapidly advanced that even the most famous of untreated humans would seem infant-like in comparison -- The activated Corpse was able to manipulate it's enemy in ways that would seem so unbelievable as to have been magic. NP-Hard problems would be solved in minutes and it has been said that an activated Corpse was able to innately understand and *control* chaotic systems at will. There was a factor that determined the abilities of the *undead* though. The circumstances of their activation would determine the scope of their abilities - Whereas a Corpse downed in combat would become a near immortal fighting machine, it would not be able to redirect these energies towards purely intellectual pursuits for instance: encryption breaking. A Corpse activated in a lab would not have the sheer combat prowess of one who'dies' under gunfire. Thus the usage of Corpse activation was strongly controlled by all governments who had acquired Corpsetech. After three days of *undeath* the Corpse would fall unceremoniously to the ground to die for the last time. \n \n The activated Corpse was such a fearsome thing that many enemy combatants would immediately choose to shoot themselves in the head the moment a Corpse was reported as *fallen*. \n \n LT Jones flashed her teeth at herself in the mirror as she wrapped the stiff, blood covered bandanna over her head. The soldier holding the mirror before her looked nervous, and for good reason. There was a power associated with the donning of the *deathcap*, even friendly untreated soldiers would shy away from her when she had entered this state of mind. A Corpse was a Corpse, friend or foe. They'd follow her into battle regardless, knowing that her presence alone was the only thing preventing the enemy from simply dropping Rods on the whole area from orbit. Despite being a Corpse, Sara Jones was a capable and level-headed leader. Many Corpses would simply charge into battle, knowing that the mere threat of their death practically secured their safety, but LT Jones took time to make sure that the untreated soldiers at her side would also have, at least, a chance to survive. She did this, not out of some human-remnant product of sentimentalism, but because a higher rate of survival for her squad meant that the leadership in NYC were more likely to assign her the most elite of soldiers. And thus, her squad had become the posterchild for the Corpse Corps - the elite of the elite. \n \n Jones sat in the back of the APC ( Armored Personnel Carrier ) with perfect posture, her eyes closed. The sound of the speeding APC was a strange comfort, representing her chance to taste destiny in the upcoming engagement. Across from her, in the opposing metal bench, sat SGT Kilterson, playing his chrome harmonica. His habit of playing the blues before combat was something of a squad tradition and the other soldiers have long given up on preventing him from performing this rite. To his left was SPC Kelley, a young man with blonde eyebrows and a shaved head, was picking his nails with the blade of a standard issue combat knife and rocking rhythmically to the combination of blues-and-APC noise. He was a heavy-arms specialist, but tended to be more interested in trying to stab things. SFC Brave, as he was not so aptly named, was nervously checking his equipment for position and correctness. He would determine that his weapon did indeed have ammo, and then check his armor straps for the fiftieth time. Brave was a paranoid man, meek in stature and personality, but his situational awareness was world-class - His high rank was merely a product of his repeated survival. The man was nearly useless in combat, but he'd spot a trap from a mile away and allow the entire squad to skirt past it unharmed. The other 6 occupants of the APC were new soldiers, nameless until they'd proven themselves in combat. LT Jones did not even bother trying to analyze the behavior of fresh additions to her squad - Their true nature would only become apparent during combat. Their name-tags were cut from their uniforms until they survived the first engagement. This was done to prevent any innate attachment or preconceptions by the rest of the team. Soldier One-Alpha taking a.60 caliber round to the face was much less distracting than if the same thing happened to'Dave', who was sharing the name of someone's childhood friend. \n \n [ cont ]\n"}

Here's the first: \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n We were sitting in Greg's living room smoking some weed after classes, just a normal Wednesday. After a few hits I leaned back in the couch to relax for a little bit when a cat came up to me. Instinctually I just started petting it, enjoying the soft *purr*s coming from it. Then it hit me, *when did Greg get a cat? *... \n \n `` Greg?'' I said to get his attention, now intently staring at this cat, who seemed to be staring right back into my eyes. It was starting to freak me out. \n \n `` Hmmm?'' He responded. He seemed to be zoning out, he always smoked more than I did. \n \n `` Since when do you have a cat?'' \n \n `` What do you mean? I do n't have a cat, and you know I'm not really a cat person.'' \n \n Now I was confused, if this was n't his cat, then who's was it? `` This cat right here, just look at it.'' I was starting to wonder if I was just really high... \n \n `` What the fuck, where did he come from?'' Greg wondered. *Phew*, at least I was n't imagining it. It was weird that this cat was here though... Greg got off of his chair and walked over to check out the cat. Greg started patting his head, its tail started waving back and forth. I started playing with its tail, and it was then that I noticed he had a USB connector where his butt should of been... \n \n `` Dude, Greg, check out his butt...'' \n \n `` What? No dude, that's just weird.'' He was clearly confused as to why I said that. \n \n `` Seriously, he does n't even have a butt, it's just a USB connector.'' This got his attention and he looked at it. \n \n `` Dude... What if this is some kind of new prototype technology? We should plug it in.'' This was bizarre, but I had to find out what this was, it seemed alive and normal, other than this... \n \n I grabbed my laptop and plugged the cat into it. `` I'm in...'' I said to Greg when I did, getting a chuckle out of him. After plugging it in, a single prompt came up, `` Updates required. Current version: 1.0.0. Update to 256.3?'' I clicked `` yes'', dying to find out what kind of technology this cat was. \n \n As it updated a file explorer window opened up, displaying the names of several folders, more being added as the update progressed. `` Holy shit...'' I heard Greg whisper behind me. I could n't believe what I was looking at, there was a file labelled `` Cancer Cure'', and more: `` Sleeper Agents'', `` Illuminati Leaders'', `` Genocide Protocol'', `` Immortality'', `` 9\/11'', `` Trump Initiative'', and so much more. \n \n The update was now finished. A prompt came up: `` Enter password:''. I looked at Greg, he just shrugged. I decided to enter `` cat''. \n \n That was the wrong password. My screen immediately started flashing red, a new message came up `` INVALID PASSWORD. UNAUTHORIZED USER DETECTED. REPORTED TO HEADQUARTERS. RETRIEVAL OF DEVICE INITIATED. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.'' \n \n Greg and I were panicking, we had no idea what the fuck just happened. `` Someone must know we have this, it said retrieval initiated... Is it the FBI, CIA, something else? It says we've been warned, are we in danger?'' Greg started rapidly asking me. \n \n `` I do n't know, dude... This is fucking scary.'' I told him. Then we heard a knock at the door. I looked at the cat, but he seems to have powered down or something. \n \n `` Shit, they found us!'' Greg shouted, he frantically ran through the room gathering random items. I panicked as well, I did n't know what to do so I started closing out of everything on my computer, maybe if they could n't find anything on my computer I would n't be in trouble. I figured I had to delete everything, I would probably even have to break the hard drive, just to be safe. \n \n Whoever was at the door was getting impatient now, they were pounding on it, and it sounded like muffled yelling, too. Suddenly the pounding stopped. Greg and I stopped what we were doing and glanced at each other, maybe they decided to leave? \n \n Then the door knob started turning. They unlocked it somehow. `` OH SHIT, I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE!'' Greg shouted, we were in full blown panic mode now. I ran from my computer and dove for the couch, if they started shooting us that would give some protection. I do n't think Greg even knew what he was doing, he just dropped onto the floor and lay on his back, maybe he thought they would n't notice him? \n \n `` What the fuck is going on here!? Why are you two just screaming?'' Alicia yelled at us when she came in. Thank god it was just her, she was scary sometimes, but at least she was n't here to kill us or take us to prison. We tried explaining what happened to her, but none of it made sense to her, she just looked at me like I was stupid. \n \n `` Guys, that's not a cat... That's a potato. How fucking high are you?'' She asked us. \n \n I looked around, realizing that none of that just happened. `` Oh... I guess we were pretty high, ha ha.'' I told her, feeling stupid and a little embarrassed. \n \n Later, I would find out that Greg bought some LSD as well, and decided to lace our weed with it. We all had a good laugh about it. I told Greg that if he ever did that again I was kicking him out though. \n \n *** \n \n - Unnamed Government Facility - \n \n `` God damn it, Jenkins! How could you fuck up this bad and let the prototype C4T escape? Do you have any idea how much this could've set us back'' \n \n `` Relax, it's programmed to protect itself, and the guy who made it even put in a function for it to cloak itself and display an image of a potato. Nobody will know what kind of tech they have. Nobody will believe their story anyways.'' \n \n `` I'm this close to firing you, you're lucky I still need you... Just make sure you steal it back without them noticing you. And do n't fucking lose it again, this is the 5th time this week...''\n"}

He took another sip of Mountain Dew and adjusted his glasses. \n \n `` Mr. President,'' said Colonel Sanders. `` They're here.'' \n `` Excellent, let them in.'' President Morris responded. \n \n The door swung open and eight people filed inside. The room was dimly lit but the President could see just fine. The first person was a man. He was overweight, had a considerable neck beard and his hair was ragged and unkept. His shirt covered in stains, he smelt of syrup. The next was a smaller man who could n't weigh over 120 pounds with large glasses and fingerless gloves. He walked in and found a chair while cracking open a Redbull. Next, 5 small boys entered. All of them appeared to be 13 or younger and were very rude. \n \n `` Welcome.'' Said the President. \n `` Your Mom!'' One of the boys responded quickly. The others snickered with delight. \n `` That does n't even make sense.'' Responded a confused President Morris as the troop of boys made their way past him. \n \n The last to enter was a young woman, probably 20 years of age. She had bright blue hair with green streaks in it. Her eyes were hidden by the hood of her sweatshirt. She walked in without a word and sat down with the others along the wall with the nine screens. \n \n These eight people, these eight virtual worriers were the best fighters on the planet. \n \n `` Ok team,'' the President said.

We will play 30 rounds of varying game types. First team to 16 round wins will be victorious.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Earth is discovered by a peaceful coalition of civilizations . Turns out we missed several major technologies normally developed by now . The aliens are very confused how we got here .\n","story":"They started appearing a few years ago. At a glance, they seem like locusts. We would see one or two, never in large groups. Their psychedelic coloring and bizarre chirps gave us the first clue they were not bugs. \n \n That, and scientists had n't caught any. Never, not one. We could see them and hear them easily. Filmed them many times. But, they outsmarted every net. Outsmarted every trap. Avoided every poison. Some kind of intelligence was guiding then. We did n't even have a species for them yet. We just could n't catch one. \n \n They also destroyed things. Not big things. Little things. Was more like they were researching and reverse engineering things. Systematically taking apart machines bit by bit. They did seem harmless though. They mainly stuck to garbage. Enough yelling at them and they would leave something alone, for ever. They were learning. \n \n Each made a different sound. Some high pitched, some deep timber, some groaned or thumped. Like cricket chirps being played through wahwah paddles. For such little bugs, they made a large sound. In the dark they could sound like car horns. Those alien honks. \n \n We called them Lokis. \n \n One Tuesday I touched one. Was out drinking a lemonade on my patio and it landed by my hand. I had never seen one this close. I just did n't move, not wanting to scare it. I had never heard of someone actually feeling one before. \n \n The Loki looked like a fat cicada. It's mottled fluorescent colors looking like an art fair paper weight. Or, some entertainers eye. \n \n It came over and with a bug arm it touched my pinky. Just a gentle tap. It then backed off and watched. After a minute of sitting there it emitted a loud honk like a bag pipe being stepped on and it flew off. \n \n Wonder if I passed the test. No one would believe me when I said one had touched me. \n \n The day passed without any more Lokis and I almost forgot the whole ordeal. \n \n The next morning I could n't believe my eyes. The yard looked like it was covered in easter eggs. I went outside now and I scratched my eyes trying to decide if I was seeing things or dreaming. But, my yard was covered in thousands of Lokis. Never had I heard of this many gathering. They were all looking at me. And they were all completely silent. \n \n As I went forward they seemed to make a path for me. I walked over to my chair and sat down. They came back and arranged themselves around me, all sitting at least a few feet away. All facing me. \n \n Then they all started making their honks at once, at first it was deafeningly loud like a symohony had landed by my head. I screamed in pain and they went silent. \n \n Then, they started up again. Softer but gradually louder until they came to a level where I paid attention to them. Each of them giving off their own note, synchronized with another few. The one by my wrist would chirp a B8 at the same time as another two a few feet away honked their own notes, then five would honk or even twenty at a time. \n \n They were watching me react to their silly Symphony. I could only sit there dumb struck as I wished I had my phone with me. The noise had a pattern to it. It was like a piano was trying to talk. \n \n Then I started making out words. \n \n ^can ^you ^hear ^now? \n \n What? \n \n They did nothing for a few minutes. \n \n ^is ^^this *better*? \n \n Yes? \n \n After I acknowledged them they all went silent. They seemed to take 15 minutes to decide what to do next. \n \n `` Please do n't stop,'' I told them. Amazed at my weird dream. Hoping I did n't wake up? \n \n `` ^^CAN *^you* really hear *me*?'' They asked, ending the silence. \n \n `` I think so'' I responded. \n \n They did n't respond for 20 minutes this time. Seeming to think over their response very carefully. \n \n `` Why ^^ca n't ^you hear **me**?'' The bug Symphony talking piano asked in their singsong voice. \n \n `` I can here you, I think.'' I responded. \n \n At this point I did n't want to wait for the bugs response. I went inside to relieve myself and grab a recorder. The Lokis made a path for me again. They seemed to be able to react quickly as individuals by slowly as a group. Two Lokis in the house watched me as I did my requires and went outside with a cup of coffee. I sat down again with a tape deck and a note pad. \n \n `` Please ^^do n't *leave* ^^^me until we are *done*.'' The Loki Symphony said. \n \n `` Sorry. What should I call you?'' \n \n `` The name you have given me, Lokis, is fine.'' 15 minutes later. \n \n `` Call me Bob'' \n \n Over the next few days we played out the slow motion conversation with Lokis. I would make a response, they would ask a question. And so on. \n \n They were seemingly furious when I went to bed at five AM the next morning. But, I had no coice and they agreed to return. As I went to be I checked and most of my electronics and vehicle were dead. All disassembled in that characteristic methodical Loki way. I worried they had destroyed everything, but all of my food was untouched and appliances worked. \n \n The message was clear, I was not to go anywhere or talk to anyone. I was a prisoner of Lokis. \n \n After days of this echo game, I asked them to start writing messages for me. But, they were unable. Other than being illiterate and slow, they were brilliant. \n \n As far as I could tell, Lokis was a hive mind of the individual Lokis. Each Loki barely smarter than a bug. But, together they were absolutely brilliant. Their naive yet genius messages were hard to understand on many levels. \n \n When I asked `` Why, me? ``, they simply responded, `` Why not.'' \n \n They asked me `` How can humans function as individuals?'' I responded `` Sometimes we do n't'' \n \n It seemed to always take them minutes, or even days, to finish making a statement. Weeks, months, and years passed by as we established a dialog.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Today , you went into the room your parents told you to never go in .\n","story":"`` There's twenty dollars on the counter for pizza, and I want all the change back.'' A voice called from inside the coat closet. `` And Kyle, please try not to butt heads with your sister, I'll only be gone for one night and I do n't want to leave the bar early because you two ca n't get along.'' \n `` Fine.'' Kyle replied, too engrossed in the T.V. to really care what his mother was telling him. He gave a quick glance at Sam at, sitting on the other end of the couch, and their eyes locked for a second in silent acknowledgement. Neither of them really felt like starting something tonight. \n \n A gust of winter air filled the living room as Kyle's mother opened the front door, snow trailing in as she lingered in the doorway just long enough to say goodbye. As soon as the door closed behind her, Sam reached for the phone on the table next to her. `` I'll order the pizza, want anything special?'' \n `` Nah, I'm going to play some WoW, just get what you want.'' Kyle said, already trotting up the stairs to his room. His mind preoccupied thinking about tonight's boss raid on the way down the upstairs hall, his eyes slid over the locked closet next to his parents bedroom door. He stopped for a moment, and stared blankly at the plain white door. Ever since he was a child, Kyle could always remember being told never to open the closet door. He could hear his dad's voice clearly, remembering when just before he turned 7, he had asked why he was n't allowed to see inside. `` It.. it's where the boogeyman lives! Never open it, or, uhh, he'll get out and come after you!'' Obviously this was n't true, he had n't believed it then, and all these years later he still did n't, but ever since then he had always taken for granted that the upstairs hall closet was just off limits. \n \n Before he knew it, Kyle had his hand on the doorknob. *Seriously*, he thought, *there ca n't be anything in there I'm not allowed to see, it's just a closet. * But he could n't bring himself to turn the knob. He looked down and realized his palms were sweaty, and he felt his heart beating fast inside his chest. What was behind this door was so secret that he was n't allowed to see? Maybe some old jewelry his mom wanted kept safe? Maybe a gun just in case someone decided to break into their house? Could... could there even be a body? Making up his mind in a split second, Kyle twisted his hand to the right, and the knob met his turn with resistance. *Locked?? * He twisted harder, and still the knob refused to move. *But, there's no lock on the outside of the door, just one of those little holes. Why is it locked from the inside? * \n \n At this point the temptation was too much to bear. Kyle ran to his room and slid open the junk drawer in his desk. He rifled through the miscellaneous pens, coins, and random objects until he found the tiny piece of metal he was looking for. When he was younger, his mom had always used the key to open his door when he locked her out of his room, and ever since high school, he had kept the key with him to ensure his privacy. Key in hand, he dashed back to the closet door, slipped the key in the hole, and began wiggliong it around. A few painstaking seconds later, the flat end of the key latched on the lock inside the knob, and he turned it, hearing the lock click in the door. Kyle stopped. Is this really something he wanted to do? All these years he had been fine with not knowing what was in the closet and he had been fine, should he really spoil it for himself now? What if it was something he could never un-see, never forgive his parents for keeping hidden? But it was too late. He had come this far, and he was n't going to stop now. Heart racing faster than ever, he turned the knob and opened the door. \n \n Eyes darting from shelf to shelf, top to bottom, Kyle stared blankly. *Towels? Toilet paper? * He looked harder, searching for something out of place in the hall closet, a drawstring to a secret compartment, a locked box, but his eyes found nothing. The closet was a disappointing assortment of everyday household stuff, from bed sheets and towels, to toilet paper and extra shampoo for his parents bedroom and bathroom. Let down, and a little angry at himself for getting so worked up over something so boring, Kyle was about to close and re-lock the closet door when he caught a glimpse of bright red coming from behind a stack of towels on the second highest shelf. With renewed fervor, he ripped the towels out from closet, and what he found behind them was too much to bear. Kyle fell to the ground and let out a cry so filled with pain and sadness, the house must have shook with his grief. \n \n Downstairs, Sam was still sitting on the couch, half dozing off, half waiting anxiously for the pizza to arrive when she heard Kyle's mourning cry echo from upstairs. Instantly alert, she leapt from the couch and bounded up the stairs. What she found at the top of the steps was n't exactly what she expected to see. In front of the hall closet outside her parents bedroom sat Kyle, slumped against the wall with dozens of presents wrapped in Santa Claus wrapping paper surrounding him. \n `` Jesus Christ, Kyle, you're 20 years old and you still thought Santa was bringing you presents every Christmas?''\n"}

With a brief tug from his ears, his mind snapped back to his reality again. The colors of his life were still there; the eternal foundation to his canvas. But new layers had embellished it with distinct and subtle majesty. \n \n'What is it that I feel?' He wondered, before he startled and frightingly searched the ground. On the cold concrete that old walkman lied dormant. But to his relief, it was unbroken. \n \n With a gladdened sigh he picked it back up, so he could cherish the relic in his hands. It was a thing of the past. Innefficient. Unrational to preserve. \n \n `` The only way to go forward is to move.'' \n \n The lyrics popped in his head. He was humming it less than three hours ago. But now it felt so uninspired it had become dirty. Disgusting. A melody, not even a song, that should've long been drowned out by the beauty he just heard. But never had. And if it was n't for chance, might never have. \n \n Was this the crime? The item that had led the police to raid and condemn that house. How could the cleaning crew just throw it in the garbage? If it was evil, and infectious, as evil tends to be, how could they just carelessly throw it out? \n \n `` Do n't look for evil. Because when you find it, you ca n't stay good.'' \n \n Another pitiful limerick that does n't rhyme and will never aspire to another emotion than fear. But there it was. In his head. Perfectly designed to stay stuck as long as possible. \n \n Frank had to drown it out. He put the headphones back on. \n \n His opened eyes started to wetten again \n \n After three more songs, he was dead-tired. He tore the headphones off his head. Not because he wanted to, quite the opposite. He just could n't handle another second of this. The past half hour or so had been more eye-opening than the 30 years that he had lived. \n \n He stood up from the concrete. His ass was numb and his legs were tired, but he did n't really care. Before, he was n't sure why he walked away from the street and hid in this old construction site to listen to the cassette tapes. All of a sudden he understood it was because he did n't really belong on the street. He used to think he did, even though he was an outcast. Unemployed after being fired because the company found someone better, and therefore useless. A bum. Having to find his livelihood in other people's dumpsters. \n \n He put the walkman in the left pocket of his jacket. He froze the second he let go of it, and tightened his grip around the headphone cables. Of course the walkman would n't stay in his ragged coat. He did n't think of it. But now that he did, he wondered why he wore the coat in the first place. \n \n'Am I worth no more than rags?' He wondered while one of his eyebrows lifted. He used to think it was natural because he'd lost his job. But suddenly he wondered how that made him a human being. \n \n In memory of a piece of the beauty he'd just bared, his fists began to shake angrily. \n \n `` Here is a fruit, for the crooows to pluck.'' \n \n `` Fuck!'' He shouted into his hand. He was too close to the street. He had to shake the grief off, and futily tried to do so by shaking his head. \n \n Frank took a deep breath. His anger subsided by just one look at the walkman. He would be forever grateful to have come upon this solace. \n \n He filled the few pockets in his jacket that were still effectively stitched with the walkman and as much cassette tapes as he was able to carry on him. \n \n He had to go home. And for a mere second, the thought of braving the street was too much for him. He knew he could now be considered a criminal in thought, and so, could be torn from the steel faces in the street. But with a hint of a smile he realized: `` Well we all have a face, that we hide away forever.'' \n \n Frank let the newfound silk and satin his face had adorned be transformed back to steel. \n \n He went home, where he found his wife sitting exactly where he thought she would be. She was knitting her livelihood on her hard little wooden stool. \n \n At the sight of his empty hands, her eyes began to fire up with spite. But they softened immediately when she noticed the look on his face. \n \n `` I do n't care things are n't perfect.''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The zombie outbreak has started but instead of being spread through biting , it is spread by sneezing\n","story":"Stacy quickly turned off the TV on her desk, shaken. She had it muted so the children could continue sleeping soundly on their mats, but the breaking news message was still clear. \n \n She glanced at the calendar. It was March 27th, certainly too early for an April Fool \u2019 s joke, but what if the news station decided to run the story a little early? \n \n \u201c The best plan of action is to lock your doors and remain inside until we receive word that the crisis has been adverted, \u201d the closed captions said. \n \n Hesitantly, Stacy turned the television back on. The channel she was watching had gone to a commercial break, so she flipped to another local station. Images of sick people in the hospital flashed across the screen. People both young and old, bound to gurneys overflowing the halls with masks on their faces. *Just this morning everything was fine*, Stacy thought, *this can \u2019 t be real*. She couldn \u2019 t quite tell if they were alive or dead. \n \n The children were beginning to stir from their naps, but Stacy continued to sit there, completely oblivious to her classroom. Suddenly, the door burst open and she had to cover her mouth with her hand to silence the screen that almost came out. Her close friend and fellow teacher stood at the door. \n \n \u201c Have you seen the news? \u201d Harry asked, at a noise level one could consider rude if not given the current situation. \n \n \u201c It has to be a joke, right? \u201d Stacy stammered. \n \n Harry paused for a moment. \u201c My wife just called. It \u2019 s real. They \u2019 re shutting down access to the hospital and barricading the streets in and out of town. \u201d Harry \u2019 s wife was a surgeon at the hospital. Stacy had met her once at a Christmas party. She seemed nice enough, but had a very serious and professional demeanor. She didn \u2019 t seem like the kind of person to be a part of such a horrible prank. \u201c Hold on, she \u2019 s calling me again. \u201d He quickly left. \n \n *No, this can \u2019 t be happening. This is like something out of a horror movie*, Stacy thought. She turned up the television a little. \n \n A professionally dressed reporter filled her screen. It was obvious that she was uncomfortable standing so close to the hospital. \u201c We have received confirmation that the virus is quickly spreading through contact with bodily fluids. There are reports that the mucus spread by sneezing is the most contagious, but we haven \u2019 t received an official statement regarding that yet. Avoid anyone who may be sneezing and immediately vacate the vicinity. There have been reports of violent attacks from infected individuals. If possible, stay in your homes until further information is received. \u201d \n \n A fair distance behind the reporter, Stacy could see a teenager make a quick, startled movement. *Was that a sneeze? * \n \n Everything after that happened so quickly. Stacy could see that the figure in the background was no more than sixteen, but his body movements were that of someone much older and much stronger. He jumped higher than humanly possible, landing on the reporter \u2019 s back. He grabbed at her throat, and blood sprayed over the camera. The television went black. \n \n Reeling, Stacy tried to process what had happened. After a minute, she remembered where she was. The children! She needed to protect them at all costs. She locked the door and started covering the windows, following the same emergency procedures she always followed during her weekly drills. \n \n As she finished covering the windows, she turned back to her desk and heard the familiar rustling sound of the children waking. She supposed locking down her classroom woke them up. She decided to let them sleep a few more minutes, and went back to her desk, debating if she wanted to try turning the television to another station or not. \n \n She opened her desk drawer and found her purse. She grabbed her cell phone and looked for her sister \u2019 s number. As she scrolled through her contacts list, she heard a quiet, but still audible sneeze. \n \n - \n \n As promised, Harry returned back to Stacy \u2019 s classroom. Halfway there, he stopped. He could hear screaming and crying from the room. He rushed the door, but it wouldn \u2019 t budge. Locked. *Dammit! * \n \n Harry tried to kick the door in, without much luck. The school had recently seen significant security renovations, and the doors were no longer the flimsy wood paneling they used to be. Without warning, the paper covering the small window on the door fell down. He could see\u2014but not believe\u2014what was on the other side. A child, such a sweet, innocent child, was chewing on what used to be Stacy. Harry choked, making a foreign guttural noise. \n \n The child slowly turned around, making eye contact with Harry. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] In your world , the Nazis won WWII . You are a historian writing a book on what the world would be like if the Allied powers had won the war .\n","story":"I must confess that this seemed like a fun little writing project at first. Write a counterfactual short story in which the Allies somehow won World War II, and I \u2019 ve written lots of counterfactuals about all sorts of history. Of course that \u2019 s why you invited me to contribute to your anthology in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Peace of Berlin. \n \n \n The secret to writing a good counterfactual is finding places in history where small changes could bring about huge effects. I remember one work by a Heinrich Turteltaube about time travelling Boers who had given some sort of Sturmgewehr to the Secessionists and changed the course of US history. May I tell you that to my mind time travel is just lazy writing, scientists at the Arische Institut f\u00fcr Physik are close to 100 % sure that it is an impossibility. To say nothing of the fact that America has done a fine job dealing with the lower races without reinstating slavery. \n \n \n In any case some small thing that could have changed the war. It \u2019 s maddening I tell you, maddening. Nothing comes to mind, and I \u2019 ve gone over D\u00f6nitz \u2019 s 8-volume history of the war cover to cover. Shall I tell you the ideas I \u2019 ve rejected? Very well\u2026 \n \n \n I tried to write something about the invasion of Poland. But there \u2019 s really nothing there. The country was overrun within a month, and the leadership had fled within a week. After the surrender at Lodz they didn \u2019 t have enough men to carry on a resistance, and that was that. \n \n \n Next I moved on to France. Perhaps the Maginot Line would hold? No it could not. Not with the guns they had, and the speed of German armour. I actually tried writing a version in which a plane gets lost, and lands in Belgium carrying two senior officers and the invasion plans. As if such a thing could have happened. \n \n \n Although it is not my area of expertise, I tried my hand at Naval Warfare scenarios. Perhaps there was some way the British could turn the tide and gain control of the seas. I tried to imagine that they found some way to detect and sink u-boats. Not that it would have mattered after Britain surrendered. \n \n \n Then I though about the Slaughter of Dunkirk. Perhaps the Allies could remove their troops and get them to England. Do you remember the English sending all those fishing boats and sailing vessels that the Luftwaffe sank? It was a romantic idea, I \u2019 ll give them that. Of course the Wehrmacht rolled onto those beaches it was all over. Almost 400,000 dead or captured. \n \n \n I tried to think of reasons for America to get involved in the war, but I couldn \u2019 t come up with anything. I know Roosevelt was no great friend of Germany, but he was unable to find a casus belli, and after Britain surrendered politics in the US took a strong turn to the Reich, excuse the pun. \n \n \n Maybe Russia. It \u2019 s a huge country and look what it did to Napoleon\u2026 So I tried writing a story where we invaded Russia, but it seemed ridiculous. When you \u2019 re building a Thousand Year Reich you don \u2019 t need to do everything at once. Certainly history has vindicated the decision to wait for the Bomb. \n \n \n I even tried to write a story in which Der F\u00fchrer doesn \u2019 t die of a heart attack but instead lives on, and makes a series of increasingly bad decisions that imperil the war effort. It seemed blasphemous to me, even though we know he was not without his faults. Even if he had lived the war was decided by 1942 anyway, so there was very little damage that he could have done. \n \n \n Look at the world we live in, with a Reich that encompasses Eurasia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. Our allies in Japan control East Asia, and are ever happy to co-operate with us. South America has been an ally ever since Uruguay defied the British and allowed the Graf Spee to refit in Montevideo. Canada is a German territory, and the United States hasn \u2019 t been a problem since 1941. \n \n \n Perhaps it is a failure of imagination, or a reticence born out of respect for the architects of our world, but I find myself unable to complete the story you have requested. I shall instruct my agent to return the advance forthwith. Good-day, gentlemen. \n\n"}

In fact, short of some literal miracle, it was a statistical fact. \n I looked over at the garden I'd carefully preserved for how many millennia. True, I'd had to make some sacrifices along the way. The soil they grew in was largely artificial now, with only a few bits and bobs of real sand scattered about for effect, and the light that gave them all strength came from above now, with no pesky wavering of the seasons. It was much like it was in the beginning I suppose, now that it was all coming to an end. \n I sighed, and stretched myself out under the apple tree, feeling the last few warm moments of the light. I closed my eyes, not wanting to notice when the lights finally did go out. It was just too expensive. I'd held out as long as I could, longer than could really be expected of any being really. I had it on good authority that I was, indeed, the very last one still holding out.

{"prompt":"[ IP ] The truly brave men do not slay dragons ...\n","story":"`` But, what were they *like*, grandpa?'' Goran asked, with wonder. \n \n The boy looked up at his aging grandfather, no longer looking anything like the warrior he had once been. *Time makes fools of us all*, the old saying went. Still, his grandfather's eyes held some remnants of that strength. \n \n Courage and fortitude unmeasured existed beyond those dim grey portals. \n \n Sir Yora Dorak, the Dragon Rider, they had called him. Back in the time when there were dragons left in the world. The world had changed now, and Yora had changed with it. \n \n The old man looked down at his grandson with thoughtful eyes. \n \n `` They were the wind, Goran.'' He said in his deep baritone voice. \n \n `` They were strong like the mountains, they had the heat and passion of a wildfire, they were our greatest fear and our greatest awe.'' \n \n The boy's eyes widened with every syllable. \n \n `` But, Grandpa Yora, how did you ride one?'' He asked, almost pleadingly. \n \n The old man laughed. \n \n `` I asked permission.'' He said, with a mischievous look on his face. \n \n Goran cocked his head. His brow furrowed in confusion. His young mind struggled to comprehend. \n \n `` Grandpa, do n't fool. You ca n't ask a dragon!'' He said, it was so obvious. \n \n The older man looked out over the mountains that ringed the kingdom. It was a small and peaceful place, but it had n't always been so. That had taken swords and flames and cost lives innumerable. \n \n Fifty years of peace had cost much. More than the Dragon Rider cared to remember. \n \n `` I tell you true, Goran.'' He said, sounding far away. `` I asked, pleaded, because my family depended on it. My country, these mountains and valleys, depended on it.'' \n \n Goran did n't know exactly what his grandfather meant. Surely he was speaking about the time when the Volnar, terrible wolf-like creatures invaded. But, all the songs told how glorious the fight had been, how there had been many brave heroes that stood and fought. Grandpa lead them, from atop his dragon. \n \n `` We beat them, though grandfather, because you were brave in the battles. You were a hero. We were stronger than them.'' Goran spoke with the self-assured air of a young boy. \n \n `` No, Goran,'' Yora said softly, `` we were not stronger or braver. They burned our villages and we fled before them. We did not have heroes, we had cowards.'' \n \n Now Goran was very confused. \n \n `` In our last days, I climbed the tallest mountain to try to find a dragon. Not because I was brave or mighty, but because I was afraid.'' \n \n This was n't like the songs at all. Grandpa was lying, Goran was sure of it. Why he would say such things, was a matter of much confusion. \n \n `` But, you were the only man to speak with a dragon, to get close and live, Grandpa Yora, that was brave!'' \n \n `` No, it was desperate.'' Yora looked at the boy. `` Desperate men do not need bravery. Their fear is more than enough.'' \n \n Goran did n't like this story. \n \n `` Why do they say you were brave then, Grandpa?'' He begged for the answer. \n \n `` Because they know not what bravery is, child. Brave men do not slay dragons or wolves, brave men learn to live beside them.'' \n \n Goran did n't know what his Grandpa meant by that. Yora did not tell him, he was far too young to hear it. It was the part of the story that no one liked to tell. \n \n After all of the Volnar had been killed. After all of their packs hunted from sea to sea. After their young had been burned at the stake, men had breathed a short sigh of relief. \n \n After they had won, they rebuilt. After they rebuilt, they decided that they would remove the only remaining threat to their supremacy. It was the right thing to do, after all. \n \n Yora remembered watching his sword sink into his dragon's heart. The dragon that had saved all of his people. *It had been the right thing. * \n \n They had cleansed the world. Not because they were brave, but because they were afraid. \n \n *Brave men do not slay dragons. And, I am not a brave man. *\n"}

Marilyn \u2019 s newly blue eyes tracked him over the lip of her coffee cup as he made his way toward the patio door where he finally spotted her. \n \n The portly little bastard made his way over to her with his little shuffling gait and sat down in the chair across from her. \n \n \u201c Almost didn \u2019 t recognize you without the dress. \u201d He smiled, showing too many yellowing teeth \u201c You \u2019 ve had some work done I see.

Not that you care. \u201d \n \n Marilyn set the coffee cup down, but kept the tips of her long, lacquered red nails, resting on the side \u201c Come Harry. That \u2019 s hardly the way a man who \u2019 s about to get everything he wants acts. \u201d \n \n Harry leaned forward \u201c Everything I want? How can that possibly be? You \u2019 ve taken everything from me. \u201d His pitched whisper became more of a shout and attracted a waiter with too much acne and ill-fitting glasses. \n \n Harry hastily ordered to dismiss the boy and turned back to Marilyn \u201c What do you want? \u201d \n \n Marilyn sipped from her coffee, tapping her nails against the cup \u201c To ask a favour. \u201d \n \n Harry laughed \u201c A favour- \u201c \n \n ***** \n \n \u201c Was it the favour that made you kill her Ball? \u201d Droit leaned forward, clearly becoming impatient with the process \u201c Get to the part where you shoot her. \u201d \n \n Harry showed off his yellowed teeth again \u201c All in good time detective. Unless you have somewhere to be. \u201d He sipped his coffee. \n \n ***** \n \n Harry set the coffee cup down, wincing at the heat. He \u2019 d drank too much too quickly. \n \n Marilyn smiled, a wide predatory smile that showed off her pearly canines \u201c Would you like me to repeat myself. \u201d \n \n Harry shook his head, visibly disturbed \u201c Do you have a cigarette? I left mine in the car. \u201d Marilyn reached into her purse and tossed a pack onto the table. \n \n Harry lit one hastily, took a long drag and watched the traffic. \u201c How would I do it? \u201d \n \n \u201c Right here. Right now. In the chest. \u201d \n \n \u201c You want me to shoot you in the chest? In broad day light. In this caf\u00e9? \u201d Harry laughed \u201c Marilyn I \u2019 ve done a lot of fucked up things over the years, killed a lot of people. For both of us. But I \u2019 m not going to murder you in front of all these witnesses. I \u2019 m not going to rot in a cell while you rot in the ground and leave our children with nothing. \u201d \n \n \u201c Junior and Sandra will both be taken care of. \u201d Marilyn leaned back in her chair and crossed her legs. Her movements lazy and graceful, like a cat. A lion. \n \n Harry snorted \u201c By who? \u201d \n \n \u201c By you. \u201d \n \n \u201c I can \u2019 t care for our children from a jail cell Marilyn. God damn, has being on the run all these years really fucked you up that badly? \u201d \n \n \u201c Harry listen to me. This is how it \u2019 s going to work. \u201d \n \n ***** \n \n \u201c So she wanted you to kill her? \u201d Gauche looked down at his notepad, as if reading the details a second time would help. \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s right. \u201d Harry stared into his empty coffee cup and frowned \u201c Can I get a top up. \u201d \n \n \u201c Later. \u201d This from Droit, still leaning on the table like he was moments from jumping over it and strangling Harry. \n \n Harry sighed and laid his hands on the table. \n \n ***** \n \n Across from him, Marilyn had laid a small six-shooter revolver. \n \n \u201c Everyone here has been taken care of. Caf\u00e9 staff has been paid off. Streets are clear. \u201d Marilyn gestured behind her \u201c The last of my money. \u201d She paused and smiled \u201c Our money. Has been used to pay off the caf\u00e9 staff and patrons. Everyone is already expecting you to do it. I \u2019 ve got Marvin on retainer, you remember Marvin, the DA who got Tommy and Bill off? He \u2019 s going to help you out with the police. You \u2019 ll be out in a few hours. \u201d \n \n Harry looked around, indeed they were alone on the patio and the street was empty. Marilyn slid the gun closer to Harry. \u201c Will you tell me why? Why now Marilyn? After all these years. \u201d \n \n Marilyn glanced away, she watched the sun shine off the windows one the building across the street and she shrugged \u201c It \u2019 s time. \u201d \n \n Bang. Bang. \n \n Marilyn \u2019 s body jerked twice as she was thrown backward out of her chair to the ground. Patrons and staff in the caf\u00e9 screamed and fled. \n \n Harry sat numbly across from his ex-wife \u2019 s body and waited for the cops to come get him. \n \n ***** \n \n \u201c So you shot her. \u201d Gauche had put his pen down and was staring directly at Harry. \n \n \u201c I didn \u2019 t say that. \u201d Harry grinned at them \u201c Now if you don \u2019 t mind. I believe my lawyer is probably waiting to hear from me. \u201d \n \n There came a knock at the door. \n \n Gauche and Droit exchanged glances, before Droit stood and opened the door. A uniformed officer waited on the other side. Droit frowned at him and exited the room. \n \n The door slammed as it shut. \n \n ***** \n \n On the other side of the world, in a private airport hanger two children stood with their nanny as a small jet taxied into the hangar. A boy of seven and a girl of thirteen could hardly contain their excitement as they watched a woman in a red dress debark from the aircraft. \n \n \u201c Mommy! \u201d cried the boy and he sped toward her. \n \n ***** \n \n Droit re-entered the interrogation room, looking none too pleased. \u201c Well Ball, bad day for you. \u201d \n \n Harry frowned \u201c What d \u2019 ya mean? You two aren \u2019 t bad company. Little cagey, but we can worked through that. \u201d \n \n Droit \u201c There was no answer at your lawyer \u2019 s office. Number belonged to a dry clearner on 5th. \u201d \n \n Harry felt a cold sweat settle over him. \n \n \u201c More to the point. We \u2019 ve got a line up of people outside the station claiming they were at the caf\u00e9 at witnessed the shooting. \u201d \n \n Droit sat on the table and rested his forearms on his knees \u201c Care to explain that Ball. \u201d \n \n \u201c Bitch. \u201d Harry muttered. \n \n ***** \n \n Marilyn released her two children and smiled at the woman who had been with them. She stood and crossed the short distance toward her. They embraced and shared a warm kiss. \n \n \u201c The switch went well? \u201d she murmured, resting her face on Marilyn \u2019 s shoulder. \n \n \u201c Jose had someone waiting in the ambulance when they showed up. \u201d Marilyn kissed her again. \n \n \u201c So we are free? \u201d \n \n Marilyn nodded \u201c Marilyn Ball, nee Alberts, is dead and her husband will spend the rest of his miserable life rotting in a cell. \u201d \n \n They kissed again, and were interrupted by the feel of tiny hands around their waists.

His diabolical plot was finally coming to fruition, and he walked to the bank with hate in his heart. \n \n `` Dude, how many times do I have to tell you? My name is Robert Smith! I'm just walking to the bank to cash my paycheck!'' \n \n I changed your name a few chapters back, Victor. Anyway, the evil scientist walked, preparing for his evil scheme to begin. \n \n `` I work at an animal shelter! And what do you think I want at the bank?'' \n \n He thought about the intricacies of his plan one last time. He felt inside of his jacket, feeling the bombs he had planted inside of his coat, ready to throw. \n \n `` Bombs? What are you - OH GOD, THEY'RE IN MY COAT!'' \n \n Victor knew how unstable they were - if he did n't go straight to the bank to carry out his plan, there was a good chance that they would detonate. If he dropped them, he'd probably get hit by a bus or something. \n \n `` Oh my god, are you threatening me? I'll have you reported! I'll...'' \n \n A runaway van came careening around the corner, with its front covered in spikes. Swerving down the busy street, it just narrowly missed killing Victor. \n \n ``... I'll go to the bank.'' \n \n Victor made the wise decision to continue his walk down the street. \n \n As he walked, he ran through the plan one last time in his head. First, he would enter the bank inconspicuously, and get in line. Then, he would consume the piece of antidote gum hidden in his pocket, and drop the sleep gas bomb. He would be immune, thanks to the gum. Then, he would use his explosives to blast his way to the vault, load up bags with the money, then use his rocket boots to fly out of there. \n \n Got all that, Victor? \n \n `` Jesus, that's convoluted. Are you sure that's a good plan? I have a feeling the readers will hate that one - no suspense, not super clever...'' \n \n Victor suddenly got a chill, remembering how quickly his life could be cut short by people much smarter than he was. The explosives weighed heavily on him, and he thought about the chance that they could go off at any second. \n \n `` Good plan. Let's go!'' \n \n As Victor walked into the bank, he suddenly had a very stupid idea. If he did n't take the antidote gum, he would fall asleep with the rest of the bank! Rather than him stealing the money, it would just be a freak accident in which a whole bank feel asleep. Despite all evidence to the contrary, he decided it would be the right thing to do. \n \n Just as he made this decision, Victor spontaneously combusted. It lit the bombs, and was an all-around horrible death. If only he had listened to what people told him, maybe... \n \n `` Jesus, Author! You killed another villain?'' \n \n The hero of our story, Captain Awesome, walked onto the scene, angry at the picture before him. \n \n `` This is the fourth one this week! You really need to stop killing them before they can even commit a crime!'' \n \n Captain Awesome suddenly had visions of the horrible fate that Dr. Nefarious had met befalling him, too, and knew that he should n't question those in power. \n \n `` Oh, come on. You know you do n't have a story without me. In a world where you're all-powerful, it's a little ironic that only I can stand up to you, but you need me if you want a publishing deal.'' \n \n Captain Awesome, despite smelling bad and being incredibly ugly, had a very good point, which contrasted his usual stupidity. \n \n `` Nice to see you're finally seeing the light. Now, how about next time you actually find somebody EVIL, rather than trying to make some poor person fall into the role?'' \n \n Oh, fine. Do it your way, without any fun. \n \n `` And can you please bring this poor civilian back to life? He was just trying to be good!'' \n \n Victor Nefarious suddenly stood up with no memory of what had happened.

To the right, hidden as a part of the moulding he found a switch. \n \n A firm press released the switch with a heavy clack and the panel spring towards Tom's eager hand. \n \n In front of him was a small work space with a three legged stool that looked to be closer to sawdust than lumber. Thick cobwebs draped themselves over most surfaces, vying with the dust to cover every object in the small space. \n \n His eye was caught by metal, glinting in the yellowy light. It was the corner of a gilded page of a book, buried amid a mass of journals, newspaper scraps and writing implements. Pens, pencils and quills all present along with crayons, chalk, and even some calligraphy brushes. \n \n On the wall a compendium of articles with notes scribbled all over them, passages highlighted or surrounded in angry red ink. Question marks and arrows linked disparate elements from multiple pages with odd numbers. One column had four headings that read: c7zqypr, txv8d, c8yuns, e44uys. \n \n In the center of everything was a journal that looked slightly newer than the rest, bearing a simple paragraph. \n \n `` I know. I've been where you are. It's tempting, is n't it? To try to piece the clues together. To be the *one* who figures it out, finally. But you ca n't. You mus n't. The lost memories are just that, lost. Do n't pursue it, you will not be happy. White Wings is too involved. It will not end well for you. It did n't last time. DO NOT PURSUE THIS MADNESS AGAIN, TOM. You will regret it. -5\/16\/2068'' \n \n Pure and abject terror gripped Tom for a long while. His mind thrown back to all the times he'd been caught red-handed doing something bad as a child, every lie he'd been caught in as an adult. That pit in your stomach that feels like it's pushing your organs into your throat when you know, *you know* that trouble is coming. \n \n He stared, utterly still, at the paper before him. It was clearly addressed to him. It was dated a year before he moved into the house, and most distressingly, it was in his own handwriting. \n \n *********************** \n \n TWO YEARS LATER \n \n *********************** \n \n Peering into the window of Tom's house had become much like looking into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic. Sheafs of papers ranging in topics from pharmaceutical testing procedures to agriculture to advanced thermodynamics lay strewn about. Seemingly random, the chaos has an order that he can see. \n \n A web of thread and ink hinted at connections between data points, the name White Wings Medical appears over an over again. Articles about disappearances and obituaries of over 20 individuals all pointed back at the company. Sketchy writing, Tom's own, repeated the same question everywhere. `` Whitecoats?'' \n \n To the side, a separate set of portraits. A middle-aged woman, closer to aged than to middle, smiled up at him alongside pictures of two slightly older gentleman and another man, roughly 30 years old. Beside and underneath was his own writing, `` Wife and Son? Cousins? Related somehow. Where did the memory go?'' \n \n Pale light bloomed in the cramped space between papers, books and treatises on game theory as a monitor sprang to life. Programs trawling the web for keywords fed him new information on a near-constant basis. \n \n A message flashed on the screen: **NEW AUDIO FILE READY FOR ANALYSIS** \n \n Tom swiped a few times on the keyboard, readying a transcribing program and a few others that would create and disseminate the information to his many backup servers. \n \n The faint hiss and pop of a recorder trying to imitate silence reached Tom's ears as he waited to see why the computer had pulled this file. His pupils dilated and that familiar pit of terror grabbed at his throat. Heart pounding, Tom put the message on repeat and listened for ages he leapt into action. \n \n Underneath the commotion of hurried packing and Tom's hurried footsteps the message played over and over, Tom's own voice playing back at him. \n \n `` The Whitecoats are coming. Tonight. Run. Fast and far. And for God's sake please give this up. It's better this way. Let them do their work.'' \n \n ( continued in reply, was too long )\n"}

I pinched the bridge of my nose and sighed. `` No no, I have n't changed my mind, I have no interest in repenting and rejoining my heavenly brothers or whatever you just said.'' He was getting mumbly in his old age. \n \n `` It's about Damian, no, he's still alive.'' I regarded my son, sitting quietly in the corner `` meditating'', I wanted to throw up nuclear waste. \n \n Here I am, the great and powerful Lucifer, and through my own charms, I managed to have a son. Most fathers would be overjoyed, and I was, we reveled in sin for months after his coming. But Damian was different. He was quiet, loved animals, and soft music. The boy enjoyed cultivating plants and was even *sweet* in nature, it was really starting to wear on me. \n \n Damian had n't always been this way, as a child he had been a right terror, I was so proud. Yet, once he turned thirteen he began to distance himself from our revels and destruction. He began to read, and wonder about the human world. The first time I had caught him growing flowers I could have killed him. \n \n `` Lucy?'' My father's grumbling voice brought me out of my thoughts. \n \n `` Dad, I have asked you not to call me that. It is n't my name.'' Damian opened one eye and chuckled. \n I hated the pet name my father had imposed upon me, and I hoped he could feel my hatred through the phone. \n \n Gently tapping one of my horns with the receiver I plowed on. `` Dad, I was hoping Damian could stay with you for a few months, get some topside perspective on humans.'' \n \n Silence on the other end, I waited for a response and picked my teeth with a claw. again my eyes were drawn to Damian, and I resisted the urge to drop him into a lava pit as a very lovely flower sprouted from the crushed skull of some unfortunate sinner. \n \n \n *Please, please, if you ever loved me. * \n \n Another flower sprang up and I felt the cheap plastic of the phone caving in my clenching fist. It was going to take me months at LEAST to clean up all of the torture chambers and pits that were now full of grass and flowering plants, much less corral all of the animals he had spawned down here. Hell was a mess. And that was surely saying something. \n \n `` This is highly unprecedented son, considering your, status.'' \n \n `` Yeah Dad, I know, but it would be a good chance for you to get to know him. He IS your grandson after all, and do n't give me that'we are all God's children crap, you know what I mean.'' I was scraping the bottom of the barrel here. \n \n `` Dad, he's not like me now, he's like me then.'' Grinning with all of my teeth, I knew I had him when I heard the gasp on the other end. \n \n *BINGO old man, this is your second chance. * \n \n `` I will send someone shortly.'' *click* \n \n My clawed hand replaced the phone and I turned to my son who was regarding me quietly. \n \n `` So we are n't that different after all.'' \n \n `` Well son, we will know for sure after your time with your grandfather.'' He looked confused and I laughed to myself. \n \n `` Go get your stuff, someone will be here soon.'' \n \n `` You really think this is the best idea?'' Damian looked nervous, great. \n \n `` Yes, you wanted to observe humans, perspective from down here is n't great. Plus, it will give me time to get some work done.'' I motioned around. `` Clean up a bit.'' He nodded and made his way to his room, springing flowers behind his hands as they trailed the hall. My claws covered my face before I could scream. I had so much to do. \n \n -- - \n \n \n About an hour later and my son and I stood at the red gates, his backpack in tow. Strangely, I would miss the little pacifist. He may not be my ideal, but he was my son. I was hoping this time away would do him some good. \n \n An explosion outside of the gates blinded us both, and before us stood the angel Micheal, grinning ear to ear. He motioned to Damian who waved at me as he moved to join my brother. \n \n `` Hey! Long time no see Lucy!.'' \n \n I groaned. \n \n `` I have TOLD you guys not to call me that.'' \n \n \n -- - \n \n \n I sat at my desk, enjoying a large cup of steaming blood with a dash of tears, reveling in the sound of pained screaming. \n \n It had been two months since Damian had gone to stay at his grandfather's place, and Hell had never run more smoothly. Everything was back in order, and I was pretty much free to terrorize my charges at my pleasure. \n \n Sipping out of my `` Mondays are Hell'' mug I clicked on my email, noting I had one from Damian. It was probably more photos of him and Dad, or of his art projects, like the ones he had sent weeks before had been. \n \n Yet it was neither, it was a single line of text. \n \n `` I can see why you hated it here.'' \n \n Pride swelled within me and I wiped a sulfuric tear from my eye, taking another sip. \n \n `` That's my boy.'' \n \n \n -- - \n \n \n Thanks for reading!

{"prompt":"[ IP ] I 'm Done As Promised < 3 Mom [ possible NSFW ]\n","story":"My mother disappeared two thousand years ago. We were in the Jerusalem, trying to catch a glimpse of the Christ in person, when we were separated during a riot. We were mixed in with the locals when the Roman soldiers broke up the crowd. I went one way, she went the other. \n \n At the time, I did n't fret. We had been separated before, sometimes intentionally, and we had a routine when we visited a new time. Our *safety blanket* rules, my mother called them. \n \n *First rule: do n't panic. * My mother used to say, `` the only thing dumber than a girl in a panic is a man.'' ( My dad left when I was five. Which is fine, really, because he was an asshole. The last thing he said to me? `` I wanted a son.'' Wow, dad. Wow. ) \n \n *Second rule: meet at our primary safe space. * We have limited control over the locations of our landings, so we often end up in less-than-ideal spots ( like an American CIA-controlled black site in the late 1990s ). Whenever we landed from a jump, our first step was to locate a safe space that we could use as a fall-back point. In Jerusalem, we had chosen a peaceful copse of almond trees just outside the town. \n \n After the riot, I had followed the crowd away from the soldiers until I could slip down an alleyway and get out of town. I made it to the trees at dusk. My mother had n't arrived yet, so I made camp and waited. I counted the stars that night, trying to find familiar constellations in a time so different from mine. \n \n When she had n't shown up by morning, I moved on to our third rule. *Read the signs. * My mother was adept at leaving traces of her passing\u2014a twisted branch here, an abandoned shoe arranged just so, a scrap of fabric caught in a window, little bits of trash that I could read like a map. When we would sit at night, she would braid my hair and explain her system to me. Anything broken indicated a change in our plan. Anything soft and flexible indicated that she wanted a little alone time. Shoes meant a long distance. A line of chalk on a wall could mean many things, depending on the angle, the curvature, the color. \n \n She had been captured once before, in France during World War II, and I spent three weeks tracking her to an Allied prison camp. I'm no fan of the Nazis, but twice in my life I've been a prisoner of Americans and I do not recommend it. \n \n There were n't any signs in Jerusalem. Nothing in the town square where the riot started. Nothing in the town jail nor the soldiers' garrison. I searched the market and the temple for weeks. One night, as I lay among the almond trees and stared up at a night sky untouched by the light pollution that always accompanies modern times, I felt touched by the empty vastness of space, as though a cold finger had run its tip from my neck to my navel. I gasped. My stomach felt hollow and my throat clenched tight. \n \n I knew it, then, the truth: I was alone. \n \n ***** \n \n A few points about time travel. \n \n First off, `` time travel'' is a misnomer. Really, I'm hopping between multiverses. There are an infinite number of multiverses, and every time you ( or any other sentient creature ) make a decision, more little multiverses spawn. When I switch times, I'm really switching to another multiverse as well. \n \n Second, my interdimensional transtemporal teleporter can only access a very small number of those multiverses\u2014about 1.7 million. Each multiverse is coded with a combination of four letters or numbers. My mother had a little journal where she tried to keep track of the codes and multiverses, but it was a hopeless task. Even 1.7 million possibilities is incomprehensible. I stopped caring about the codes a long time ago. \n \n Third, jumps are available every three days ( subjective time ). Once I jump, I have to keep myself alive for 72 hours before I can jump away. Remember I mentioned a jump into a CIA blacksite? Those were three *very* difficult days. \n \n Finally, my teleporter's quantum crystals are synced with the crystals in my mother's teleporter. This keeps us locked to the same time and location, although we must select the same multiverse to travel together. \n \n ***** \n \n It's been ten years of subjective time since I saw my mother in that crowd in Jerusalem. I'd like to say that I spent that time searching for her, but I'd be lying. I spent the first year looking for my mother before I gave up. There are too many possible multiverses, how could I ever stumble across the right one? \n \n The night I decided to stop actively looking for her, I threw an impromptu wake. I was in 1960s Last Vegas, so I rented a car and drove out into the Mojave desert with a shovel and a bottle of whiskey. I dug my mother's grave that night, and I threw in an old dress of hers. Most of my clothes were once hers, to be honest, so I had plenty of options. I built a bonfire, drank some booze, and howled. I must have looked like a fever dream to a local: a drunk young woman, wearing clothes with unrecognizable fashion, ranting about memories of my mother the time traveller. \n \n When I woke up the next morning, I discovered two things. One, my head and whiskey are not friends. Two, I did n't need to find my mother. A weight had lifted from my shoulders. I was n't a bad daughter for saying goodbye. I was just a young woman, independent and alive and ready to make my own life. \n \n That was nine years ago. Nine years of wandering, of living, of loving. And leaving. I've made many friends and left every single one. Perhaps I'm more like my father than I knew. Perhaps I should be worried about the growing coldness in my heart, this numbness that lets me smile and laugh and giggle and then walk around a corner and disappear forever. \n \n Today, something touched that numbness in my chest. \n \n Today, I found a sign from my mother. \n \n Her handwriting was unmistakeable, even after a decade apart. The words\u2014'' I'm Done, as promised'' \u2014were meaningless, but my mother's simple code revealed her true message: \n \n I D A P \n \n Four letters. 1.7 million possible multiverses at my fingertips, coded into the teleporter on my wrist, each represented by a combination of four letters or numbers. Four letters, scratched in chalk on the sidewalk. \n \n I D A P \n \n Love, Mom. \n \n ***** \n If you liked this story, you might like my other stories at \/r\/hpcisco7965 or \/r\/TMODAL. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Afterwards, they are all branded with the same secret: THIEF THIEF THIEF on every man and woman, in every interview, every time. \n \n \n It doesn \u2019 t mean that they steal, or even that they nicked a candies from a penny-stores when they were wee. I suppose it \u2019 s their old lies, eating their guts up inside. \n \n \n If you took a man from his home, bound him to a chair, tortured him until he died while screaming \u201c Tell me! Tell me! \u201d and wrote his last words on his forehead, you would see him as I do. People are made of nerve-endings and shame. \n \n \n Hindu women are immune, when they wear the bindi.

Psychopaths are always clean. \n \n \n Babies have secrets, though I try not look at them for too long, it \u2019 s... uncomfortable. Like staring into the sun. \n \n \n When I was a child, it was a dot on the forehead, of a colour you \u2019 ve never seen. By the time I was nine I knew how the universe coloured adulteresses, and I blackmailed Dr. Hassenhoff into helping me hone my talents. She \u2019 s a charming woman, a little pudgy, terrified of me, but useful. A truly talented psychologist, with two kids, perfectly suited for my ends. After three years of bi-weekly sessions, we refined the coloured dots into words and I released her. She moved to Florida. The first words I ever saw were on her forehead. She wasn \u2019 t an ADULTRESS anymore. Her \u2018 last words \u2019 were JAMIE GOLDSTEIN. \n \n \n Do you think it \u2019 s a good name for a professional poker player? Seems sort of tacky for a gambling man to have a Jewish name, but it really can \u2019 t be helped. Enough about me, though. I think you know me pretty well by now, better than anyone, except, of course, Hassenhoff. \n I miss her. \n \n \n Oh yeah, Katherine. You wanted to know about her, right? \n \n \n Her Mother \u2019 s dead ( emphysema, age 34, Katherine and I were 13 ). Our families were close, and I attended the funeral. There, in the open casket, I looked at a dead body for the first time. To my joy, I could still see it! BURDEN! Right across the corpse \u2019 s face! The bigger the guilt, the bigger the letters, and there they were, B-U-R-D-E-N, BURDEN! \n \n \n Huzzah? \n \n \n Her father is a coal miner. An ape of a man, Katherine \u2019 s lucky she didn \u2019 t take after him. He was one of the ones who inspired me to hone my talents with the good doctor. That is, his colour was unique. I couldn \u2019 t, therefore, place his shame by categorizing him amoung people of similar life-styles ( married, unmarried, divorced, parents, pastors, ect. ). I had to know. Not knowing makes me very upset. \n \n \n As my time with Hassenhoff made his sin more clear, I began to understand why I couldn \u2019 t quite place his colour before. His shame was complex and unique. Where a word will do for most men, he needed an entire phrase. It barely fits on his broad face, the letters are so big with pain. \n \n \n LET DADDY FUCK ME \n \n \n It \u2019 s so funny, \u2018 DADDY \u2019 written with infinite fear across the face of the biggest bastard in town. The man mines coal for fuck \u2019 s sake. He \u2019 s the size of a goddamn tank. If I didn \u2019 t have my gift, I would have run from his daughter \u2019 s cunt and off a cliff, but I do so I \u2019 m fucking her. \n \n \n Who \u2019 s going to resist the lonely girl at school with a brand-new pair of tits and KATHERINE GOLDSTEIN on her face in pink? Not I. \n The mistake was getting too close. She used to wonder about her father \u2019 s moods. His drinking. She caught me at a... sensitive moment. I guess I blabbed. Told her I heard it somewhere. \n \n \n She went to him. They talked, he cried. I could hear it through the walls.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Science and Magic are merely opposite sides to which the pendulum of time swings . It has leaned for the past few centuries towards the Laws of Science but even now it begins to return ever faster back towards the Laws of Magic .\n","story":"A rainbow snow of pixels pulsed across my monitors, tone-shifting and obscuring the paper I was grading until it faded away like droplets three seconds later. For a few moments I was transfixed, as if the unfamiliar pattern the pixels rippled was more than noise. As the last fluctuations collapsed toward single pixels and off of my screen I sighed. \n \n `` Chris'', I shouted across the room to one of my grad students, `` any idea what would cause a monitor suddenly tone-shift what I'm working on?'' He looked up from the lab table he was working atop with a small pressure chamber and its connected laptop. \n \n `` You too, professor? I just had something like that on this screen as well.'' He glanced at the monitor on my desk -- the only desk in the room. His pupils narrowed and surely lost focus as he looked past me and my computer in thought. \n \n `` Chris?'' I'd thought this had more to do with his electrical and hardware field than my materials science, but he was surprisingly unresponsive. \n \n `` If you had the issue as well, it would make sense for it to be a network issue but it looked more like fingers pressing on an LCD.'' He turned his stool toward me with a troubled look on his face. `` But it went away real fast. Maybe there was an EM pulse?'' \n \n I shrugged and calmed down. Somehow I'd gotten agitated by the screen without noticing my emotion. Seeing my student troubled, my role of mentoring and providing a calm sounding board took precedence over phantom anxieties. \n \n Gently, I probed his response. `` Did this look like an EMP wave?'' I assumed not. \n \n `` No, ma'am. I've seen electromagnetic fields cause a sort of shaky image or normal snow but this was made of moving points. At a field strength enough to have pixels magnetize into weird patterns the monitors should have lost signal.'' \n \n I was by now turned away from my screen and had rolled the deskchair toward the open tile to show Chris he had my full attention. `` So,'' I began slowly, `` what does that leave us?'' \n \n He began to list off possibilities as he rested his tilted head into an open palm. `` A virus that causes a specific pattern without other issues -- unlikely, if this was a pressure change in the room -- we would have felt it, and I ca n't think of something magnetic or electrical that fits. It was like an invisible swarm of bugs pressing on the screen with their footsteps.'' \n \n `` But if it was n't air pressure and not a magnetic wave then that leaves a network issue,'' I concluded. \n \n `` So someone maybe hacked the campus just to play a pattern over the monitors?'' He seemed content with that. `` I'll check the resource use then. This sort of complex look would put at least minor strain on the CPU or GPU.'' \n \n `` No luck.'' Chris turned back toward me. `` Resource Monitor does n't show any weird spikes or processes. I guess that's fine since we do n't have to notify site security but it does n't solve the puzzle.'' \n \n *Damn. * I cursed in my mind that I'd have to leave this alone. \n \n `` Is your experiment still fine, by the way?'' If the same thing that affected the monitors affected the apparatus then Chris could need to replace the sample. Our hope was that by stretching the alloy by reducing ambient pressure it would permanently lose some bonds and form certain patterns. The smaller the scale these patterns could be made regular, the more useful this material would be in future computer chips. It was standard Materials Science work, but any shock to the apparatus could ruin it. \n \n He was silent a long while. `` Actually, no. Around when the thing happened to the monitors, there was a sensor glitch and afterwards they're contradicting.'' \n \n `` As in the sensors need to be fixed?'' I had gotten up and started walking toward Chris and the experiment. `` Or the sample is doing something weird?'' \n \n He looked stumped as he checked over the instruments so I took one of the thermal cameras from a cabinet. His experiment was relatively stable temperature so it had n't needed any of the cameras, which would view hot areas as blooms of red and white against the purple and black of cool objects. \n \n I turned the camera on and it seemed to boot just fine. The objects in the room were a standard blue cloud. As soon as it was responsive I began narrowing its range of sensitivity by swapping its lens and settings. \n \n When I pointed it into the experiment, something was very wrong. The alloy pulsed with colors somewhat like my monitor had. \n \n `` Chris,'' I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the camera over. `` Your sensors are probably fine.'' \n \n He tilted his head into the camera rather than hold it in front of himself, probably to keep the image on the screen visible to me. \n \n `` Ma'am, what the *hell* is this? Temperature spikes? But there should only be under a watt of electricity running through it right now.'' \n \n As the screen on Chris' laptop once more pulsed and sparkled with the strange snowlike patterns, I shrugged. My heart was beating fast and I knew I should be excited, but an unscientific part of my mind was wary and even afraid. At least in the room I was in, physics had begun to break down. \n \n Slowly the pulses across screens as well as the background interference that showed on our sample would become more common. Eventually these deviations from order began to form heartbeats.\n"}

His great grandfather had been born the same way, broken at birth and had died unceremoniously during WWI. \n \n Despite graduating at the top of his class at West Point, and being the youngest lieutenant since the civil war, he had been eaten alive by his own troops. \n \n When times were good and his troops won victories at Normandy and Lyon they had seen him as a brave leader. As they sat in a fox hole surrounded by the Germans, starving for nearly a week, all they saw was a man whose face was made out of bread. \n \n \n Harold had long ago given up on trying to make sense of it, there were simply strange medical oddities from time to time, two headed snakes, people with extra limbs, and his face was made out of bread. \n \n It looked real enough from a distance, the structure was all there, eyes and nose that functioned just like they should, the lips themselves were real skin, and the hair of his beard was the same as anybodies, though he never dared to shave with a straight razor, but his skin, his skin was like a fresh baked pita. Warm and smooth to the touch, with just enough of a papery texture and comforting yeasty aroma that let you know something just was n't quite right. \n \n \n Growing up hadn \u2019 t been easy, his parents themselves had been popular in high school, had lived the life people had expected of them, they were supportive, but they could never understand what it was like. \n \n How the kids would throw lunch meat at him at recess, the girls who would pretend to kiss him in class only to take a small bite of his cheek, then scream in disgust as they ran back to their friends. \n \n \n \u201c OMG, it really is BREAD, eeewwwwwwww!!!!! \u201d The dare completed, and the joke on him. His lone consolation being that his bread didn \u2019 t scar, he often wished his heart could have been made of bread as well. \n \n \n College was easier as it often is, he might not have been the most popular kid, but he learned to fit in. Self-deprecation became a weapon, nobody could make fun of him better than he could do it himself, so people stopped trying. He made some good friends, and left with some great memories, but he hadn \u2019 t so much as been kissed. His overwhelming insecurities and a lingering fear of being tricked playing no lesser part than his genetic handicap. \n \n \n Then he met Tilly and everything changed. \n \n \n Tilly said he was Handsome, and not the usual, \u201c you \u2019 re really handsome for a guy \u2019 s whose face is made out of bread, but we \u2019 re such great friends, why risk that. \u201d \n \n NO, there were no qualifiers, no implied rejection! \n \n He was just handsome as he was, bread and all. \n \n \n He thought Tilly was just the most beautiful girl in the world, blonde hair and a slim figure. Some might have commented on the ears that stuck out a little too much, her slightly crooked teeth or the freckles sprinkled over her nose, but to him, they were her best features. \n What made her unique, what made her beautiful, what made her perfect. \n \n It was as if the happiness went up through his toes, knees, chest and out the top of his head, only to travel around the world and enter back in his toes, an endless cycle of bliss. \n \n \n \n The problem with happiness of this magnitude is it often leads to tunnel vision, the switching off of the cerebral cortex, pure emotion taking the place of rational thought. This state rarely leads to good decisions. \n \n \n And so it was that day. They had been together for almost a month, she thought he smelled delicious, she joked that she had a bread fetish and he was the only one who could give her a fix. She had been so many firsts for him, first date, first kiss, first love. She had also been the one who suggested they take a walk on the beach, a first he had chosen not to admit to. \n \n He had never really understood why his parents had never taken him to the beach, they were most likely afraid the humid air would make his face soggy, or that he might fall in, the damage possibly irreversible. But he was an adult now, he wouldn \u2019 t fall in, his face had gotten soggy before and had always dried out. He was no longer going to let his face stand in the way of his happiness. \n \n \n They were holding hands, talking about where they wanted to travel, all the places they \u2019 d never been. The cool air felt refreshing against his bread, he marveled at how big the ocean truly was, and how powerful it was when you came so close. He had suggested they walk out on the pier, he didn \u2019 t want this day to ever end. \n \n \n \n Tilly smiled at the old woman, a slightly crooked tooth glinting in the strong sun, ears peeking ever so slightly from under her blonde hair. The old woman smiled back, as she tore off bits of stale bread and flung them to the waiting seagulls, Harold saw nothing but the beautiful freckles on her nose. \n \n Tilly \u2019 s smile fell, her eye \u2019 s turned to the seagulls, their heads cocked slightly askew every last one of them now staring at Harold. \n \n \n \u201c Honey, I think we should go back. \u201d Her voice a whisper, as if the birds could hear her. \n \n \n It was too late, all Harold heard was the war cry of an attacking Seagull, he looked up just as it tore a piece of bread from his left cheek. Before he could react another bird took off a piece of his ear. Tilly didn \u2019 t even have a chance to scream before she was swallowed in the beating darkness of a thousand wings.\n"}

Looking around the living room I recalled the parties she had thrown as a way of honing her sociality. \n \n \u201c Oh yes this one we got from an auction in London vacationing across Europe, \u201d I always imagined her describing every last piece of furniture in the house as if it had a personality of its own. The vases were dashing, colorful pieces while the ballerina sculpture was a beautiful depiction of extraordinary contortion. In reality though this kind of talk was reserved for earlier in the night and as it drew on she would grow more flirty and fond of talking of our personal life. \n \n She was the one who began to display jealously first, it took less than two years from our marriage: a prime display of what I am capable of shelling out. She would question my business gathering and also how I was capable of spending a week talking to people about investments. This is coming from someone who has the high school education of a western private Catholic high school- or piss cash drops as I like to call them. Indulge in the creationist \u2019 s method of teaching and you end up with this idea of interaction that could not be more skewed: people only talk to other people because they want something. This would even support her understanding of my business meetings, but I digress. \n One day I come home from New York and she immediately accuses me of having an affair. \u201c What kind of man goes and cheats on a woman like me with some city whores. \u201d \n \n \u201c Whoa, \u201d is the only response I could muster. \u201c Would you like to look at my transcripts? \u201d This is the degree of trust but verify we have devolved to, I thought. \n \n With the bottle perpendicular to my skull I moved to the next room, knocking over our- my- adornments at this point: the Mongolian soldier replicas, the glass zoo, the year round nativity scene. I justified this as I moved across the second floor- better to make it look like an act of passion. I almost forget about the planted body in my bedroom as I wobble towards the end of the corridor. \n \n My brother was the one who helped me when I killed her; I swear it was an accident. I didn \u2019 t mean to push her over the rail. Chance would have it that she would land directly on her head, she might not have even been dead but I couldn \u2019 t risk it, I wasn \u2019 t going to court for someone who only made my life hard to bear. So my brother made the suggestion of a second life. I had enough assets to live comfortably for a while somewhere where no one would find me. On the phone with him I panicked, asking whether I should hire him or cover it up. \u201c Do you have a sturdy plastic container? \u201d he responded, \u201c Alright I \u2019 ll be right over be ready to do some nasty stuff. \u201d My brother enters my house with a black duffel bag and pulls out a large bottle and pairs of rubber gloves and gas masks. \n \n What happened next I was not ready to do. \u201c What kind of man cuts up bodies on his own floor?! \u201d I imagined her yelling at me. As I put on the gloves and mask I thought about this room, the entranceway to the posh linoleum and marble counters. \u201c What are we going to do with the house? \u201d I asked. \u201c Burn it down, or something \u201d he chuckled dumping in a leg. \u201c You know, you \u2019 re very sentimental for someone who just committed murder, even if it was an accident. First we \u2019 ll have to kidnap a homeless man. \u201d That detail bothered me the most. \n He chose three am on the following night and had me pick him up in my SUV, which I would have to kiss goodbye anyways. \u201c I have a few different drugs here so this should be easy, \u201d he said. I drove circles in downtown until we found someone in an alley on an empty street. I watched as he motioned to the man to get in our car waving the baggie in front of him. Poor guy, I thought. He used the hypodermic needle in the backseat of my car, not much for talking was this one. The smell of trash was so rank by the time we got back to my house that we opted to spraying him down in the yard before putting him in my bed. \n Setting up my room was the hardest part for me emotionally, dragging the body up the stairs and into the bed I had spent many nights with what was now disintegrating flesh and blood. \n \n \u201c I have a passport for you, \u201d he said to me two days later over the phone. I hadn \u2019 t slept but three hours the entire time. I didn \u2019 t realize it was foreign at first, the blue all too familiar for me. \u201c I have a place in Quebec you can stay at, your new name is Joseph Harving, and I bought you a Prius. \u201d \n \n I set up the accident, lit a candle in my room and set all the burners to leak gas while I made a trail of it in the hallway. Driving away was the most nervous I had ever felt, every second I thought if someone had seen me over the past few days what would happen. \n \n \u201c What is your business in Canada, \u201d border patrol eyed me suspiciously. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m returning home, \u201d I said in the best relieved voice I could fake. I received a smile as I was waved through. \n When making your getaway, always travel light. \n \n \u201c Here we see where the trail of gasoline started, \u201d says one officer, \u201c and it ends right in front of this room where the body was found. \u201d \n \n \u201c Did we get a positive match? \u201d asks the other. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s inconclusive, some things just don \u2019 t add up, such as height, and who would want to burn to death? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well we \u2019 ve got neighbors saying he was acting weird in and out and one said they saw a car leaving the day of the fire. \u201d \n \n \u201c We still haven \u2019 t gotten interviews from family members, \u201d says the other, looking in on the charred room. \n \n Love what you guys do!

As a self trained Wizard, stealing the power of elements from Odin himself spitting in the face of man and god alike, I am a very pro-active individual and capable of learning without guidance. While I'm proficient at working alone, I am quite capable of working in a team as well as leading a team. I have trained several apprentices including The Great Bamboozler, Vlad the Impaler, Joan of Arc and finally Greg, who is currently on staff and recommended I apply to you directly. \n \n My greatest strength is, as listed above, control of electrical magic. I can conjure storms with only 0.2 % air moisture levels, Stormbringer Savos is the only other Wizard that can boast a similar claim. Considering electrical school of magic is my focus, I am unable to practice any form of earth school magic, as per the Wizarding restriction guidelines of 0398 AD. However according to Greg the Apple company has very little use of earthshaper magic so I believe this will be of little detriment to my candidacy as a Wizard at the Apple store. \n \n I believe I would fit in well with the team as I have extensive experience working with other Wizards performing incredibly complex tasks, including summoning demons, banishing demons, teleportation to different dimensions, destroying ancient deities, restoring ancient texts, hiding an entire continent and keeping the kitchen clean.

I am very excited to fly with you tonight! You're reputation precedes you. You have so much flight time and I've never even flown a 777 before.'' \n \n `` Nothing to worry about Fariq. These things practically fly themselves.'' \n \n *Several moments of switches being checked, the pilots calculating their flight statistics and prepping for take-off procedure, then a slight groan could be heard from the recorder. \n \n `` Are you alright Zaharie?'' \n \n `` Just a slight headache. Do you mind calling one of the stewardesses for some water?'' \n \n `` Not a problem.'' \n \n *Sounds of Fariq picking up the phone and calling the stewardess for water. Fariq gets up when she knocks and lets her enter the cockpit to drop off the water then she leaves. \n \n `` Okay Fariq. Are you ready for this? I think you should lead the taxi and take-off. I'll supervise.'' \n \n `` Are you sure? I've done the simulations, but I've never done an actual take-off.'' \n \n `` You've got to learn sometime young man. There's no better day than today.'' \n \n *A slight shuffle is heard in the background \n \n Fariq's voice. `` What was that?'' \n \n `` Probably nothing. Maybe one of our bags shifting in the storage.'' \n \n `` Are you sure? I thought I heard something moving.'' \n \n `` You're imagining things. I heard no such thing. Now concentrate on the take-off.'' \n \n *Fariq and Zaharie handle the take-off and are now airborne - Time into flight: 0 hr 5 min \n The sound of one of the pilots grabbing the comlink for cabin announcements comes through the speaker \n \n `` Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking. We have taken off from Kuala Lumpur International and are on our way to Beijing. Our flight looks clear from here and we are expecting to arrive in just under 6 hours. Our stewardesses will soon be coming down the aisle with refreshments and sleep masks if you require them since it is late tonight. I hope you enjoy your flight and thank you for flying Malaysian Airlines.'' \n \n *The comm link is set back down \n \n Zaharie's voice comes on `` I always like that part. Welcoming the passengers on board. The initial ascent and the real beginning of the flight. It never gets old.'' \n \n Fariq chuckles then says `` You really enjoy this job do n't you.'' \n \n `` Yes I do. This is my life. What about you?'' \n \n `` I'm enjoying experience. I've worked so hard to get here and getting to pilot a 777 is really big for me. I want to see the world.'' \n \n `` That's good to hear.'' Zaharie's voice trails off and takes on a different tone. `` I love flying. I wish things did n't have to be like this today though.'' \n \n `` What was that?'' \n \n `` Oh nothing Fariq. Sorry. The musings of an old man.'' \n \n `` Are you okay Zaharie? You look a little off there.'' \n \n `` No, no, it's nothing. I just had an unpleasant experience with family before the flight today. The thought just popped into my head. I'm fine.'' \n \n `` Want to talk about it?'' \n \n `` No Fariq. I'm sorry. It really is quite unpleasant. I'd rather just focus on the flight. Actually, if you want, I would n't mind some time alone if you would like to take a small nap. I can take this part of the flight.'' \n \n `` Well I'm not really tired...'' \n \n `` Fariq, I insist. It's late and when you wake up we'll do some flight training on the controls.'' \n \n `` Okay. If you insist.'' \n \n *Sounds of Fariq unbuckling and going to the cot. The cockpit remains quiet and soon the sounds of Fariq's steady breathing emanates through the cockpit. At this point the auto-pilot is engaged. Time into flight 0 hr 22 min. Zaharie is heard getting out of his seat and moving around the cockpit. The is a sound of compartment being opened and a zipper being opened. Urgent whispering can be heard but is incomprehensible. After a short time, the zipper is closed and Zaharie returns to his chair and sits in silence for several minutes. Time into flight 0 hr 55 min. Zaharie alters the flight path of flight MH370 away from the original flight path and towards the Indian Ocean. Fariq wakes up soon after and rejoins Zaharie \n \n `` Anything happen while I was out?'' \n \n `` No not really. Have a good nap?'' \n \n `` Yes. It was refreshing, but now I am ready to work.'' \n \n `` Of course, of course. First though... idle thought... have you ever heard of the banjang?'' \n \n `` Um... yes. Yes it was a creature my mother used to scare me with as a child. But it is just a story. Not real at all... Wait did something happen to our flight path? It does n't look right.'' \n \n `` I know of the Bajang. i used to hear it's meowling all night long. It haunted our property. It has haunted my family for a long time. We knew it's ways and we knew it's tricks. I thought I could tame it.'' \n \n `` That's an interesting story Zaharie, but did you change our flight path?'' Fariq asks urgently. `` We're not on our original heading.'' \n \n *A soft, sickening thunk comes through the recorder in the next moment. It sounds like a knife sliding into flesh. \n \n `` Hrrnk.'' Fariq grunts and gasps out the next words. `` Wha... wha... why?'' \n \n `` Shhh, Fariq. Save your breath. I stabbed your lung. You will not be able to scream.'' \n \n *Another sickening slice of the blade can be heard and Fariq quiets. \n \n `` I was telling you Fariq that I tried to tame the Bajang. And it was oh so friendly at first. Did you know it likes to eat children? Sickening I know, but worth the protection it provides. And there are children aplenty in the Malaysian streets. But as time went on it's appetite grew and grew. It used to be sated for weeks, but after a few years it demanded to be fed on a weekly basis. I could n't keep feeding it.'' \n \n *Zaharie gets out of his chair and walks over to the compartment and opens it again. He opens the zipper and something comes out this time. There's a soft thump as something drops to the floor and walks across the cockpit. Then there is the sound of an animal tearing into flesh. \n \n `` I flew so often Fariq. I loved it so much. The Bajang was supposed to protect my family. They did not know it. But I guess I was away too long this last trip. He grew so hungry Fariq. You do n't understand what happens when they are so hungry. I came home and my family was gone. How fickle the Bajang is. If he had just waited a day. But I guess this job worked me too hard.'' \n \n *Zaharie returns to his seat and the sound of Fariq being eaten continues for over an hour. The beast sounds ravenous as it tears into the flesh. Time into flight: 1 hr 57 min. The cabin is depressurized. Oxygen is deployed but soon depleted. Enough time passes that the passengers must be dead. The cabin is repressurized. Zaharie is heard rising again and opens the door of the cockpit into the main cabin. The footsteps wander out of the cockpit and go into the cabin. The door shuts again. \n \n `` Forgive me my transgressions but the beast must be killed. There is no other way. I'm sorry my beloved and my children. I failed you. Now I will fly to my death and take this beast with me.'' \n \n *The recording continues until the beast can be heard beating on the cockpit door, but to no avail. The fuel eventually runs out and the last bit of the flight recording is the plane going into an uncontrolled descent. \n \n ~Recording end~ \n \n Charles looked up at the surrounding room. Everyone was pale and speechless. His notebook was only partially filled out. He had stopped writing ages ago as the recording went on. Nobody said a word. \n \n Carefully he walked over to the computer technician and instructed him to delete the audio recording and then he turned to face the committee. \n \n `` Clearly we can not tell anyone about what happened on the flight. We will have to go public that the cockpit recorder was damaged beyond repair and that the only conclusion we can come up with is that it was pilot error. Does everyone agree?'' \n \n There was a chorus of nods. \n \n `` Ok then. That closes the books on flight MH370.\n"}

I had n't really smoked since college- but a lot of states had been legalising recently, so I was thinking about trying it out again. I did n't think I'd buy anything- but once I got on the site I knew I had to try some. You have to understand, I was a heavy user back in the day- but the weed on there... it did n't even look like the same plant. Big thick buds; actually green instead of that tawny brown shit. I mean, christ some of it was purple! \n \n So, I thought'hell, I'm nearing my golden years. I've got a nest egg, I'm not long off retirement- my kids have kids. I'm not in a place to hang around campuses looking to buy- this seems safe'. I ordereda quad of something called'Purple Haze'. What can I say? If it was good enough for Jimi. \n \n A couple of days later I got a knock at my door. On the step was a... well. I hesitate to say man. When I opened the door, other than an overpowering stench of ganja I was struck by the figure's height. It was so tall, I craned my neck to get a look at it's face- but I was only met with a huge cloud of smoke billowing out from underneath a wizards hat. It wore a shabby grey suit that was several sizes too big around the mid section while barely covering it's forearms and shins. \n \n -Mr bigblackdragondildo? \n \n It's voice was like nothing I'd ever heard. I've hear people call the Irish accent melodic- but it almost sung each syllable. I was so taken a back by how beautiful it's voice was- it took me a moment to register that it had addressed me by my screen name. \n \n -Uh... yes... I suppose that's me. \n \n -I have traveled a long way on the silk road. May I come in? \n \n -Of course. \n \n It stood on it's tip toes as if it was a ballerina and without any other leg movement floated into my home. It had to duck to not slam his head on the door frame, and once inside it bent at the knees and slouched to fit. The creature turned to face me, and emitted a high giggling sound at my slack-jawed expression. It was so loud, I became very concious of my neighbours and very concious of the smell. I had n't even told my wife I had ordered drugs. A panic set in and then an anger at this... this thing's casualness. Before I could speak up it said- \n \n -Shall we go somewhere more private? \n \n -Yes. I have a garage. \n \n I led the way. \n \n -Do n't worry about the neighbours. When they look my way, all they'll see is a slight shimmer in the air- and all they'll smell is a hint of rosemary and thyme. \n \n College kids are getting weirder every year. \n \n -You mentioned in the email that you had n't smoked since around half of your species lifespan a go. I decided that, in the interest of creating a comfortable experience, I would talk you through the specifics of this strain. Sick Hendrix poster Mr bigblackdragondildo. \n \n I had almost forgotten I'd hung that there. It's still up there abovera set of old weights that have n't been used since January ( and wo n't get used again until next January ) and a record player. \n \n -Oh is he still big? \n \n -Hendrix plays the guitar in a way that transcended what my people thought homosapiens were capable of Mr bigblack\/ \n \n -Please, just call me John. \n \n -Ah. I thought you wanted to keep the codenames. Your lot can never be sure who is listening. \n \n -I'm sure we're safe here. \n \n -Yes. Ofcourse John. It is strange how interested you people are in one another's private affairs. Most other developed planet moved past this kind of petty noseyness eons ago. Seeing as you are a fan of the meastro himself, would you care to listen to his new single? I find this strain is particularly good at enhancing music. \n \n -I'm sorry- new single? \n \n -Yes.'The Sand Dunes of New Neptune'? It's an instant classic. \n \n -Hendrix is dead. \n \n The creature let out that high giggling sound again. \n \n -Is that still an issue on this planet? \n \n -What? \n \n -Death. \n \n -Yes. How could it not be? It's the second bloody law of thermodyanmics! \n \n -Your people really do just believe whatever your told are n't you! I bet you still have resource wars around here. \n \n He went into a fit of giggles here. At this point I was starting to get annoyed with him. Now- I'm no square. I protested veitnam. But the way he talked about me, and'my people' was rude. It was as if he did n't respect me at all. I assume he's just learnt about the military industrial complex for the first time and is trying to lord it over me for being an American. I did n't vote for Bush, and yes Iraq might have been a resource war... but sometimes these things are nessesary. And anyway- I ca n't do anything to stop it- so why should he act like I'm some sort of stupid ape? \n \n -I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm still getting used to the culture here. It's very different to my home planet. \n \n -Mr... uh\/ \n \n -My people do not have names. We have moved past the need of them. We are connected at all times to all things. Each member of my species is like a single drop of water in a spider's web reflecting all others. We contain the soul of our group yet we are still one. Once we realised we were all one conciouness experiencing itself subjectivly, names seemed pointless. \n \n -Uh... \n \n -If it helps you can call me Dr Greenthumb. \n \n I did n't know what this guy's game was- but I did know that I wanted some of whatever he was smoking. \n \n -So, I asked for a quarter of the....eh, the Purple Haze? \n \n -And a fantastic choice that is too. A very creative smoke, excellent for listening to music, or perhaps drawing. Very fruitful for the beautiful work- though I'd reccomend not using when the doing the nessesary work. \n \n Whatever man... \n \n -Okay. \n \n -I've pre-rolled you a few joints in the bag. Do n't worry- I did n't take it out of your weight; think of it as a gift for a hopefully long freindship. I would advise you to take one draw, leave it about five minutes- see how you feel and then take another. \n \n -The stuff is that good eh? \n \n -It's out of this world. \n \n He gave me the grass, and left me the the new Jimi record he was talking about. He left saying something about having another appointment across town. He said I could keep the Jimi record. \n \n After dinner I told my wife I had scored some pot. She was receptive to the idea of trying it again, but she wanted to clean the house tonight. She said I was welcome to smoke in the garage- only I had to light an incense stick. I went through and sparked a doob, and stuck on the single. And here's the crazy thing, I got so stoned I was almost convinced that it was actually Jimi for a while. \n \n I'm telling you, college kids get weirder every year. \n \n\n"}

This wasn \u2019 t torture. This was a joy. A treasure. A beautiful send off to a hideous life. \n \n Shelly was looking down at a cut on her leg, but Garth was paying more attention to the lean, youthful, creamy strips of muscle. They were tight, the skin taut and fragrant. Being so close made him savor what would happen next. It was like a hunter, creeping through the brush, watching bambi pause to take a drink from the stream. It made him aroused. \n \n Soon the knock on the door came. \n \n Some uncertainty, some precursor to fear twinged inside Shelly. An alertness. He could feel her groping for names and events. Did she accidentally invite someone over? Of all her friends, who might show up now, at this hour, totally uninvited? \n \n It was just the neighbor, asking her if knew the number of the people who lived upstairs. They had agreed to water her plants while she was away but lost her phone.

Not only was forty reales enough for two trips to the movie theater *with* popcorn, candy, and soda. More important, it was Winston asking me. Winston. \n \n Everyone knew Winston was one of the hardest, baddest motherfucking hoods in the favela. He used to live about ten minutes walk away, before he moved to the big house. When I was seven he was fifteen, and I used to watch him play futbol with my brother and the older boys in the pitch behind the run-down church. In the favela, you idolize three kinds of people. Futbolistas, rappers, and hoods. \n \n I knew Winston was a hood. Everyone who lived in the big house was a hood, or a hood's girlfriend. Word was they ran with Marcos Aurelio, one of the biggest bangers in Rio. That might've just been a rumor, though. A real hood never told you who he ran with. \n \n So when Winston asked me to help him load some shit into his truck, I knew I had to say yes. Maybe he was going to take me to the big house. Maybe this would even be my chance? The bangers employed kids as young as ten as runners and bag boys, and I was thirteen. I still had n't shot a gun, but I could learn quick. \n \n The car ride over was quiet. Winston was silent, and I did n't know what to say. We listened to some American rap music on the radio as his truck bounced and rumbled down the dirt roads. I asked him what we were moving. \n \n `` Just some stuff. Do n't ask questions, kid.'' \n \n Of course not. I should have known that. \n \n Five minutes later we drove right by the turn to the big house, and my heart sank. I knew the turn because my brother had gone over once or twice. My brother was not a hood, but he was friends with a few of them. They only invited him to the big house once or twice a year, he said. I'd never even seen it from the outside. \n \n My disappointment grew when we turned into a large scrapyard, about twenty minutes out from the favela.

I have to make a call.'' \n \n He flicked his lighter and lit up a cigarette, then walked off as he dialed a number on his phone. My heart picked up again. Maybe we were making a pickup! This was certainly an isolated enough spot. If he was bringing me on a pickup, then for sure he wanted to take me on. \n \n `` *Oi*, it's me. I'm here with Gustavo's brother.'' I watched him pace, stopping to take long drags of the cigarette. What a badass Winston was. My brother was tough, but he was no hood, not like Winston. \n \n `` No way, boss. I \u2019 m not stupid. \u201d \n \n I wondered where he was hiding his gun. I knew he was carrying one. \n \n \u201c I know. *Filha da puta*, \u201d he cursed loudly. If I cursed like that, my mother would knock my teeth out. I guess I \u2019 d have to learn to curse like a man, if I was gon na be a hood. \n \n \u201c Yeah, I know boss. \u201d The cigarette was almost halfway gone, he was dragging it so hard. \u201c Now I \u2019 m here with the kid. So we just wait for him to come out of hiding, right? \u201d \n \n *Oh, shit! * This was a pickup. I couldn \u2019 t believe it. They must \u2019 ve been planning to bring me in for a long time. I was one of the tallest kids in my year. Were they watching me play futbol? Seeing how fast I could run? I felt like I was a hundred feet tall. \n \n \u201c Okay, then what? \u201d \n \n Maybe I \u2019 d ask Winston for a cigarette after he hung up the phone. My first one. My brother never let me have any of his. \n \n I watched him stand there, listening intently, eyes narrow and face betraying nothing. He took a long drag, then threw the butt into the dirt and stepped on it. There was a long silence. \n \n \u201c... Got it, boss. \u201d He hung up his phone and put it away. \n \n He reached behind his back and pulled out his gun. He aimed it at me. \n \n I thought I was going to piss myself. \n \n \u201c Get the fuck out of here, kid. \u201d \n \n I stood there petrified. The blood drained from my face. I couldn \u2019 t move. I felt like my feet were held down by cement. \n \n \u201c Run, kid. Right now. You have cousins in Sao Paolo, don \u2019 t you? Use those forty reales I gave you on a bus ticket. Get the fuck out. \u201d \n \n I put my back against the truck and just stood there, staring at him. The barrell of the gun looked like an endless pit. \n \n \u201c Right *now*! Or do you wan na get fucking shot? \u201d \n \n Next thing I knew I was running down a dirt road. The gun, the scrapyard, the truck, Winston \u2019 s face, gone, like it had all been a dream. I ran all the way to the bus station. \n \n -- \n I found Gustavo \u2019 s little brother drinking coca cola behind his house. His parents were out. Thank God. They would never have let him come with me. `` Come on, *pirralho*. I need you to help me load some shit into my truck. There's forty reales in it for you.'' \n \n I drove him to the scrapyard Marcos Aurelio had said. I didn \u2019 t say much on the way. I had a feeling this had something to do with Gustavo, that prick. \n \n When we got there, I lit up a cigarette and called up Marcos Aurelio. I felt bad about the cigarette. I only smoked them when I was nervous. I told my mom I was gon na quit. \u201c *Oi*. It \u2019 s me. I \u2019 m here with the kid. \u201d \n \n His deep voice came in covered in static. These disposable phones were a piece of shit. \u201c Have you said anything to him about his brother? \u201d \n \n \u201c No way, boss. I \u2019 m not stupid. \u201d \n \n \u201c Good. \u201d Marcos Aurelio had this way of talking that made my blood freeze in my veins. \u201c Gustavo sold us out. He went to the police, collected his bounty, and dropped off the face of the earth. Four of our guys got busted on his tip. \u201d \n \n \u201c I know. *Filha da puta*. \u201d \n \n \u201c You know we can \u2019 t let betrayal like this slide, Winston. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, I know boss. \u201d This was where my nerves started flying. *I knew it. * He wanted to use the kid as bait, to lure out his brother. I didn \u2019 t like where this was going. \u201c Now I \u2019 m here with the kid. So we just wait for him to come out of hiding, right? \u201d \n \n \u201c Not quite. \u201d \n \n Relieved, I allowed myself a breath. \u201c Then what? \u201d \n \n \u201c Gustavo ran out on his family. There \u2019 s no guarantee he \u2019 ll take the bait. So we \u2019 re gon na send a message. \u201d \n \n *Oh, you cold son of a bitch. * \n \n \u201c Kill the kid. Even if traitors get away, people have to know we always get them back. \u201d \n \n My heart started racing, my blood boiling with hate. I took a long drag of the cigarette and let it fill my lungs, holding it for a long time. Joining this shit had been a mistake. Ever since moving to the big house, I couldn \u2019 t look myself in the mirror. I stepped on the butt. \u201c... Got it, boss. \u201d \n \n Very carefully, I pulled out my gun and stared the teenage boy in the eyes. I had to make sure this kid never came back to Rio de Janeiro again. \n \n \u201c Get the fuck out of here, kid. \u201d \n \n He went white, and backed up slowly till he hit my truck. He looked so young, scared out of his mind like this. \n \n \u201c Run, kid. Right now. You have cousins in Sao Paolo, don \u2019 t you? Use those forty reales I gave you on a bus ticket. Get the fuck out *right now*! Or do you wan na get fucking shot? \u201d \n \n He started running. He always did run fast. Marcos Aurelio would have probably tried to recruit him eventually, if his brother hadn \u2019 t gone to the police. \n \n I would have to tell his parents to run away too. Then I \u2019 d have to figure out about running away myself. \n\n"}

Karen from accounting is waking in.... and she's wearing a Mexican poncho. And she has a mustache. And a top hat. Gosh, me. \n \n `` O.k., now my boss is entering the break room. Oddly, he looks fairly normal. Save for the SINGLE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FOREHEAD! He's yelling at me to finish those business reports.

I'm turning around, and my boss is now the size of Godzilla. But he still fits the in the break room. Alright, so he's roaring. Now he's smashing the ground, and the floor caves in. I'm falling, and falling, and falling into a random black abyss below. So, I guess my office is housing hell underneath it? M'okay. \n \n `` Alright, so I'm still falling... and I hit the ground. I'm looking around, and.... wait a second, is that my college dorm's backyard? Indeed it is. I'm dusting myself off, and I walk through the backdoor. I think I'm beginning to panic, realizing I need to let everybody in the dorm know that my boss is some crazy Cyclops and is about to destroy the city. I'm running through the halls, yelling at everybody to run. Nobody's listening to me though. In fact, they're laughing. What jerks. Oh, wait, I'm beginning to realize why they're laughing. \n \n `` I'm in my underwear. Nice. \n \n `` Alright, somebody's behind me. Oh, it's my landlord.

I'm frantically yelling at him to get the heck out of the city before my boss comes for us all, but he's now begging me to help. I'm agreeing, and following him outside. Except we're now at my elementary school playground. He's pointing to something, telling me it needs to be built. We're getting closer to it. It's.... a go-kart. I'm telling him I do n't know how to fix it, and he's telling me to figure it out. So I'm trying to fix it, slapping parts on it randomly. Miraculously, it starts! HA! Take that Dad! I can too fix stuff! At least in my dreams. Which does n't help much. \n \n `` ANYWAY, I'm turning around to tell my landlord it's done, and, OH MY GOSH HE'S INDIANA JONES. I *knew* he was hiding something! I just always assumed it was something weirder and creepier. He's telling me that he needs my help to find the Lost Ark, and I'm agreeing. We jump into the go-kart, which is now some sort of awesome-looking vehicle from Mad Max. We're now in the desert, too.... for some reason. But I do n't care! Me and Indy are gon na find this Ark! I put the petal to the metal, and we tear off into the great beyond. I see a mountain in the distance. Indy is pointing to it, saying that's where the Ark must be! I'm knodding my head in agreement. We're getting closer. Crap, this dream is the coolest! I may have to end up adding it to my'Epicness' playlist! Anyway, we're practically at the foot of the mountain now. We're getting out of the car. Man, this is gon na be good. And now.... \n \n `` I'm in second grade. And my teacher is yelling at me to finish my spelling test. And all the kids are laughing. Oh.

I had a plan to stabilize the economy, create jobs, and save the environment, and according to my staff, Congress was likely to back it.

Behind his fake smile, a glimmer of fear surfaced in his eyes. With confidence and ease, I stepped out from the backstage, waving to the crowd. \n \n This was going to be a cakewalk. I repeated the strategy in my head - attack his strategies and point out the flaws and hypocrisies of his false accusations, and I would n't even have to talk about the scandals his campaign tried so hard to hide. \n \n Two steps from the podium, I started my usual greeting: `` Hello, Las Ve-'' \n \n I felt my foot slip out from under me - apparently some janitor did n't do his job correctly. I spent an eternity with that falling sensation, watching the floor rise up. Then my face hit the floor hard, and I felt blood flowing from my nose. \n \n *** \n \n I watched the clip of me falling after the debate.

All of the afternoon walks in the park and Netflix cuddle binges came back to her with a soft lighy, the memories seemed slightly blurry. The only memory she had of him that was crystal clear and sharp was the look on his face when he walked in on her cheating on him.

I try to forget about the strange night I had before, but such an attempt warrants remission. \n \n I spent most of the night preparing the quiet preparations that come with being a bachelor. Franklin, my room mate, has left for some time to visit his sickly Grandmother in Arkansas. I grew acquainted with the idea of controlling the minor details of my might. This had included a finer meal and glass of wine to accompany my misguided tastes. Misguided by, perhaps, my desire to be more than what I am. \n \n After my dinner, a mediocre stew concocted of vegetables, chicken, salt, and dumplings, I wrapped my mind around the internet. Web page after web page I read some terrible tales of woe. One of a disturbed child who reinterpreted in horrific detail the darkness of her time in Hitler's Germany. The blank stare, absent look, and the blackness of her eyes that transcended the photograph. Misery, confusion, and the failure of human kind. \n \n A similar photo grew in popularity. This photo looked strange, almost inhuman. At first, I had not the slightest idea of what ghastly creature which my eyes had examined. The face contorted up, flesh blown off like silly puddy. The image perplexed my mind beforehand, though what remained true were the set of eyes that looked beyond the photo. This disturbed me t he most. \n \n Still, the nights escaped me. All of these horror tales or images of some human terror were just fairy tales that Cheryl and I would partake in. Our nights were darkened by these stories, filled with terror. Unfortunately, she had gone on a visit as well out of town. I still kept and extra chair for dinner, poured an extra glass of wine, and pulled up a chair for her and I to gaze at these photos and stories. Old habits die hard even for a moment. \n \n I grew tired, though when I went to put both glasses away, I found that both of the glasses had been empty. I reasoned that my head took the wine well and slept. \n \n A dream came to me of the lord Christ, his arms extended for me. I felt the kindness of his hands lift me from the Earth. Just then, a screeching sound echoed. The lord withered into a dark blue, with vines and thorns surging into the ground. \n \n Suddenly, I awoke with my iPhone going ballistic. Instinctively I slid my finger to answer. It was late at night and wondered who it must've been at this hour. \n \n I answered to Cheryl in Facetime, who's mouth gaped her face grown redder and redder. She was surrounded by black, and her eyes ran red with blood.

Death is real, here, nearly touching me, willing me to let go. \n \n I \u2019 d imagined the moment hundreds of times, meeting Death. At first, I thought it \u2019 d come quick and fast in the night, taking me by surprise. It would be sly and quiet, ushering me out of this life when I least expected it. Then I figured Death would be gaunt and slow, dragging me unwilling out of my skin and into an ethereal realm of nowhere and nothingness. At times, when I found myself depressed, I thought Death would be thirsty for blood. With dramatic theatrics, it would slice me up and lead me onward into the unknown, cut and scarred. \n \n But Death was\u2014is\u2014none of those things. Staring at it now, I see only power and immensity. Something that can not be qualified, quantified, or understood. It looms over me, neither a darkening sky nor a brightening sunrise. And in its immensity, in the indescribable power that it holds, it seeks out me. I am the apple of its eye, for however short a moment. And to be seen by it is to truly understand oneself, perhaps for the first time, as a being so brief.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write a story in which Batman and the Joker are forced to work together ...\n","story":"The Joker spun around in his chair to face the man who had entered his chamber\/warehouse. \u201c Ah, Batman! \u201d he exclaimed. \u201c What... a... surprise. What brings you here? \u201d \n \n \n \u201c JOKER! \u201d \n \n \n \u201c That's my name, yes. Good job, Batboy! \u201d \n \n \n Batman brushed off the insult. Or did n't get it. \u201c I NEED YOUR HELP, JOKER! \u201d \n \n \n A sly grin crept over the clown's face. \u201c Now this really is a surprise! What do you need me for? \u201d \n \n \n \u201c IT'S ROBIN! HE'S CHANGED! \u201d \n \n \n The Joker tapped his chin with his long index finger. He was going for a'therapist' sort of vibe. \u201c Changed how? Is it the rebellious teenage years? Kids grow out of those eventually, you know! Well... most of them... \u201d \n \n \n \u201c IT'S NOT JUST THAT! HE'S... HE'S A VILLAIN NOW! \u201d \n \n \n The Joker sprang up from his chair. \u201c A villain?! My, that is intriguing! \u201d He started analyzing his foe, trying to find out if he was telling the truth. Of course he was, Batman was too dumb to pull off a lie. \u201c You know, Bats, if I were a villain, I would n't want to be called'Robin' anymore. Kind of a... how would I put it... little bitch of a name, I suppose. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c HE'S CALLED THE CASSOWARY NOW! HE SAYS IT'S A WAY SCARIER BIRD! \u201d \n \n \n \u201c He's right about that. But what do you need me for? Take care of the little bastard yourself, I'm busy! \u201d The Joker sneered. There must be some sort of extortion angle he could pull. He had worked out years ago that his foe was billionaire playboy, Bruce Wayne. It's was n't really a challenge. \n \n \n \u201c YOU KILLED HIM ONCE! GET YOUR CROWBAR AND DO IT AGAIN! \u201d \n \n \n The Joker pondered that for a minute. It was very tempting, but why bother with a random act of senseless violence. He had grown up... somewhat. But if he had a reason? \u201c Why should I care, Dork Knight? You can buy your own crowbar at the hardware store! \u201d \n \n \n \u201c HE'S KILLING OFF ALL THE OTHERS! PENGUIN, IVY, AND KILLER CROC ARE DEAD NOW! \u201d \n \n \n The clown was stunned. Far less competition for him now, and he did n't have to lift a finger! Where could he find The Cassowary so he could high five him, and then kill him? \n \n \n \u201c... ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME, CLOWN? \u201d \n \n \n Joker's attention shot back to the Bat. \u201c God, does he even have an indoor voice? \u201d Joker wondered. \u201c Ugh, yes, Lamed Crusader, how could I not? You speak like a jet engine. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c HE HAS HARLEY! \u201d \n \n \n The Joker's smile vanished. Well, as much as it could. The scars still made him seem joyous. \u201c No... \u201d he murmured. This was a reason for him to help. It was n't supposed to get this far. \u201c WHERE IS THE LITTLE BASTARD?! I'LL KILL HIM MYSELF! \u201d he screamed. \n \n \n \u201c HE'S DOWN BY THE DOCKS! LET'S ROLL! \u201d \n \n \n The Batmobile's remote driving system brought it roaring into the Joker's warehouse. Batman leapt into the driver's seat. The Joker ran around to the passenger. \u201c Finally the front and not the back! \u201d He had to admit, he was excited to ride in this thing. \n \n \n \u201c Alright! \u201d The clown cried. \u201c Let's go bird hunting, Bruce! \u201d \n \n \n Batman turned to him. \u201c WHAT?! \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Shit, should not have said that. \u201d The Joker thought. \u201c Just drive, Bats! \u201d \n \n \n Within fifteen minutes, they were at the docks. The Joker sprang from the car. \u201c Alright you little shit! \u201d he shouted. \u201c Get out here! \u201d \n \n \n Silhouetted by the pale moon hanging low over Gotham, The Cassowary stepped onto the roof of a nearby warehouse, clutching a struggling, bound and gagged, Harley Quinn. \u201c So nice of you to drop by, mon amis! \u201d He said, mockingly. \n \n \n \u201c What?! You're not even French, you stupid bastard! \u201d The Joker screeched. \u201c Let her go this instant! \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Ha! I think not! \u201d \n \n \n \u201c ROBIN, STOP IT! IF YOU HAVE TO KILL HER... I MEAN, GO AHEAD SHE IS A CRIMINAL... BUT THEN STOP AND COME BE MY SIDEKICK AGAIN! \u201d \n \n \n The Cassowary's face contorted. \u201c DO NOT CALL ME THAT! I'M NOT ROBIN ANYMORE! I! AM! THE! CASSOWARY! \u201d \n \n \n He got ready to push Harley off the roof, when all of a sudden, his arms ceased function. His legs went next and he collapsed. The Joker climbed up a stack of shipping crates nearby and stood over his enemy. \u201c You were doing so well up until this point! \u201d he yelled, giving Robin a swift kick to the gut. The clown leaned down and removed the device rom behind the boy's ear. \u201c This project still needs work, eh, baby?... shit, still gagged, huh? Well, maybe it's an improvement! \u201d Harley's eyes narrowed. The Joker raised his hands defensively. \u201c Geez, kidding, kidding, \u201d he said. He bent down and undid her bounds. \n \n \n As soon as the gag was out, Harley stretched her arm by punching her \u201c puddin' \u201d in the gut. \u201c Goddammit, Mr. J, spend a little more time in the workshop, will ya? Your little pet nearly killed me!.. but thanks for savin' me puddin'. \u201d \n \n \n The clown grinned. \u201c Do n't worry about it! Although this means we'll have to kill the competition ourselves now. That alright with you, darling? \u201d \n \n \n Harley shrugged. \u201c Eh, it's a little messy, but it could sure be fun! Let's go home, baby. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c I like the way you think, doll! \u201d \n \n \n The villainous duo climbed off the roof, and dashed into the night. \u201c Smell ya later, Fatman! \u201d The Joker hollered as his voice grew fainter. \n \n \n \u201c... ROBIN! HEY... ROBIN... YOU OKAY UP THERE? \u201d Batman got no reply. He really hoped Robin was okay. The last thing he wanted to do was find another one.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You discover that Earth is the `` North Korea '' of the galaxy\n","story":"`` Why are you here?'' The creature was n't particularly disturbing to me, but it was different enough from all the life on Earth that I knew it was n't from it. It's slanted eyes, all four of them, were trained on me. Its face was humanoid, but only just. The dark red skin was taught and smooth, showing none of the muscles underneath. \n \n It opened its mouth and made a series of clicking noises, mixed in with guttural syllables. The box floating next to it made three beeping sounds and then lit up. `` We are here to rescue you,'' it said in a robotic voice. \n \n `` Rescue?'' The confusion was instantaneous. I looked around at my surroundings. The bank was silent, and all the people who had just been going about their days were standing breathless, waiting for whatever was going to come next. Most of them looked afraid, terrified of these aliens, these creatures that arrived without a sound. `` Rescue us from what?'' \n \n The alien looked confused now. It turned and looked to its comrades, and they exchanged quick words in their language. Their weapons, which were been trained on the security guards, glowed a dull blue, waves of heat emanating from the foreign metal. \n \n It turned to look at me again, its eyes squinting in suspicion. `` Are you not indentured?'' \n \n The laugh came before I could stop it, the situation was so ridiculous. Whatever these creatures were, they had to have made some mistake to come here. I straightened up, looking right in his eyes. `` No, I am not indentured. These people,'' I motioned around the room, `` they are all free men and women who live their lives they way they wish. There are no slaves here.'' \n \n The alien closest to me walked over. It was only a few feet away, and it towered above me. Its tight, red skin gave off a scorching heat that gently pulsed from whatever organ pushed its blood around. It surveyed me, studying me skin, my clothing, my hair. Hell, it even grabbed my hands and looked at them. \n \n It turned and faced its comrades again, speaking furiously. They all were nodding and pointing to the people around them, not aggressively, but as if they were debating. The leader turned and spoke to me again. \n \n `` If you are free, why all of you surprised to look upon us?'' It's clunky translator said. \n \n I took a step back, looking at all of them. `` What do you mean? This is our first contact with you. \n \n It shook its head, speaking quickly. `` We have visited this planet for one-one of your solar rotations. Whenever we close, we are attacked, and this is first time in many missions that we have landed. \n \n I was stunned, but not as surprised as I should have been. After the orbital fleet was launched, I always wondered why there was a need for ships up there. Some of the reasons given were for defense against debris or to make it easier to travel. My suspicions seem to have been slightly correct. \n \n It continued speaking before I could reply. `` You leaders, they do not tell you of us?'' \n \n I shook my head. What this creature must think of us. His face was contorted in pity, like he felt bad for us. `` Our leaders probably did not know what you wanted. Whatever you have told us could have been a lie.'' \n \n It shook its head, muttering under its breath. `` Why would we lie?'' It's eyes were open now, the color showing through the inner lid. In contrast to its red skin, the greenish orbs looked through me, waiting for my answer. \n \n `` For your own gains.'' The words came off heavy and sharp, a knife against the hand extended to us. \n \n And just like that, they disappeared. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You wake up in a room . All that it contains is you and a lightbulb . There are no windows nor a door .\n","story":"At first, I was OK. I tried to understand. I tried to work out why and how I got here. I tried to find a way out. Anyone would. It took me several days ( as much as I could tell what was day and night ) to get used to sleeping with a constant light source, but eventually I managed it. After what seemed like week, I just stopped. I just sat, in the middle of the room, legs and arms crossed. When I felt sleepy I slept, when I was awake I tried to occupy my mind; I practised the Spanish and German I knew ( even before I was stuck here I would often count as far as I could in German ), I did mathematical equations in my head, and I could feel my mental arithmetic ability increasing from the poor state it had been. \n \n It was in the third week I remembered mastrubating. But to be honest, I decided I'd rather dedicate what time I would be spending here to solving problems and contemplating life, rather than fruitless, although pleasurable, activities. \n \n After 2 months, I tried something I'd often thought of in real life, but the laws of physics had prevented: I tried to levitate. To my surprise, it worked. And then, like a switch, something clicked, and I realised, if one law of physics could be broken, surely others could. So I shut my eyes, thought of a pencil, very strongly in my minds eye, and when I opened my eyes again, there it was. A pencil. Floating in front of me. Levitating as I had done. \n \n And with that pencil, I solved many conundrums of the modern world, physics problems, maths, pythagoras, disproved E=mc^2, created a theory to match it, proved it. Et cetera, et cetera. \n \n 4 months after I had started the experience, I realised I had n't wanted to eat or drink. At all. And I had lost weight, but only enough to be of normal weight. So I decided, that since I'd never explored it, I was going to Run the Perimeter of the Room every day, the moment I woke up. I tried it. It turns out that the room was as big as I wanted it; if I sat beneath the light, the walls were about a meter in front of me, and I could walk towards them to write on them as I had done when I first got the pencil ( later I realised that I could simply think of some paper. I decided early on that I was n't going to think of something that would allow me to communicate with the outside world; computers, phones et cetera ), where as if I tried to run, the room stretched to about 2 kilometers square. For some reason, the light bulb at the centre of the room lit up the whole thing. \n \n And then I had a literal light bulb moment. The light bulb had to have power from somewhere. It was unlikely, but possible, that it had a miniature generator of it's own within it, and I hoped it did n't. So I thought of a screwdriver, and a step ladder. I stood on the stepladder, and unscrewed the light fitting. Success. There were wires leading away from it. I pushed the area around where I just unscrewed. The ceiling was paneled. I hoisted myself into the crawl space, and followed the wires. \n \n And then I woke up. To this day, I still can not remember what I wrote on those walls. What I wrote on that paper. Who I thought off.\n"}

The bright dot pulsed gently from the screen before her, its white glow seemingly innocent among the billions of greens, oranges, yellows and few reds dotting the map grid. She waited a moment, then reached for the comm. \n \n Silence at first, then, `` yes, Zerreck?'' \n \n `` Commander, you need to see this.'' There was a pause, then the voice returned. `` Throw it up on the main. Await further instruction.'' The link went dead. \n \n Traci brought the display up. The heads around her turned, all facing upward at the world laid out at the head of the D.A.S. intelligence hub center. There, the colored icons of power distribution for the human race sat in brilliant relief as the whole room darkened. Silence ensued, then the murmuring began. Traci simply sat, eyes fixed to that white dot. No one moved. \n \n The doors flew open, and the Commander strode in. A tall man, made impossibly large by his Red Code. Intimidation came easily to him, so much so that his quiet voice was more a defense against potential death by terror of those around him. It was indeed possible to be frightened to death, it was clear, and his ability to command via that charisma of fear kept him safe from the Purges. \n \n He motioned to an aide, and she drew her fingers through the air in front of her. Files of data streamed across the screens before them all. All the information out of that small region in Southern China, a sea of green and yellow on the map, and a tiny white dot in the center. \n \n `` Timeline?'' His voice quiet, demanded the attention of those present, and everyone obliged. Two days ago, a child was born, out of some shack of the Ming Ghettos outside Murlong District. The white signature registered immediately, a small owlish man reported. The Commander frowned. \n \n `` Birthers are rare,'' he mused. Abilities tend to manifest later in life, whether through turmoil and trauma, or sometimes extreme vitality experiences. Bliss was common for Green Codes, whereas Yellows, Ambers and Oranges came about in military excursions or some political gambit. The Commander was a near Birther, it was known; Traci had heard how, at the age of two, he'd been orphaned in a mugging. He Manifested in his dying mother's arms. The mugger was never found. \n \n And Red was as high as the coding went. Nation leaders, generals, mass murderers. Few and far between, and always either Purged, or contained in a position of authority where tabs could be kept. \n \n The white dot drew attention like a star born upon the planet. The Commander motioned to another aide. `` Intel. Everything you can get. Turn every stone, read every scrap of paper or vid-intel. I want everything on this,'' he paused and looked back at the screen, `` unprecedented moment.'' He turned and left the room, aides following. The man he'd given orders was mumbling, reaching out to his links and contacts via telepathy leylines along the globe. \n Traci was still. A white dot. Code White. This was new. No one had ever seen it, and if -- no, when the news spread, whoever that child was, was in peril. If the world did n't hoist him or her on a pedestal, that child was doomed to death, if not worse. \n \n Traci pulled her personal comm from the lower drawee of her desk. She sent a message to Rick. He needed to know, before the major media found out. He could dig with his resources, she knew. The Commander would be furious, or as much as he allowed of himself. But she could persuade him to the benefits of Rick's hacking skills. She was Code Orange, after all. She could convince the Vatican she was the Pope, if she wanted. \n \n Traci set the comm down, and turned her eyes upward. The white dot sat, glowing. Innocent?

{"prompt":"[ EU ] Walter and Jesse successfully get Tuco Salamanca to ingest the ricin-laced methamphetamine at his desert ranch .\n","story":"`` Stink or no stink,'' Jesse said, `` one bump -- you'll be flying high for days.'' \n \n Walt inwardly celebrated. Jesse was a better salesman than he could have anticipated. Tuco, that degenerate psychopath, bought the pitch, 100 %. He had a sample of the ricin laying out on the tip of his bowie knife. He eyed it with the wild, desperate look of a junkie chasing after a new high. \n \n Jesse rambled on: `` It's a new product him and I been working up --'' Tuco bent forward, his nostrils flaring, ready to snort -- `` Careful when you hit it. It kicks like a 12-gauge when it comes on --'' He was about to do it! -- `` And it's got a secret ingredient.'' \n \n Tuco stopped. He sat up straight again. Walt cringed. \n \n `` What secret ingredient?'' Tuco asked. \n \n Jesse grinned. `` Chili powder,'' he said, nodding. \n \n Tuco sat motionless for a beat that felt like an eternity to the two hostages. He sat there, scowling, inscrutable. Walt wanted to die and just get it over with already. But then Tuco laughed that awful, bullyish, staccato laugh of his. `` Chili powder,'' he repeated. `` Tight, tight. I love that shit.'' \n \n He bent forward again, plugged one of his nostrils with a forefinger, and snorted. \n \n `` Ghh --'' He stood, wiping his nose, rolling his shoulders. `` The hell was *that*?'' he said, coughing and sputtering. `` This new product of yours is *shit*. It does n't do anything. It's like snorting flour that someone farted in.'' He coughed and hacked, and did n't even cover his mouth to do it. `` Jesus, this tastes like something died in the back of my mouth.'' \n \n He waved, indicating both men, and adopted a commanding stance. His face shone with sweat and spittle. `` You two? You might be chemistry whizzes, or whatever? But I could n't sling this crystal if I loaded it in a catapult. Stick to the blue stuff.'' He turned and headed toward the kitchen, cursing in Spanish. \n \n Jesse wrung his hands. Turning, he hissed: `` Mr. White -- did it work? When is it supposed to kick in?'' \n \n `` Soon,'' Walt said, firmly. \n \n And as if on cue, Tuco dropped the tray of meat in his hands. It clattered to the ground. Tuco followed. His legs gave out underneath him and when he tried to prop himself up on his arms, those gave out too. His jaw banged against the grimy tile floor. \n \n `` Whadjew do to me?'' he slurred. He reached out and tried to drag himself forward, tried to grab for them from across the house. `` Whadjew do? Whadjew do!'' \n \n Tuco lost the ability to speak. His voice became a shrill whine, as if all the oxygen had been forced from his lungs. He seized and convulsed. He flopped around like a dying fish, and the air became rank with the smell of his voiding bowels. He began to vomit, but having rolled onto his back during his death throes, his body could not complete the emesis and he choked. He let out a gurgling death rattle. Bubbles formed and popped on his lips. \n \n Jesse sunk back against the couch cushions, his face wan with horror. Walt sat, elbows on knees, and watched placidly as Tuco expired. Tuco's senile uncle dinged his bell over and over. \n \n `` Jesus,'' Jesse breathed. `` What *did* you do?'' \n \n `` *I* did n't do anything,'' Walt was quick to correct. `` *We* tricked him into poisoning himself.'' He had to raise his voice to be heard over that incessant bell. \n \n `` You did n't tell me it would be -- like that!'' He motioned in the direction of Tuco's still twitching corpse. \n \n Walt sighed. `` Ricin is an acute neurotoxin. What were you expecting, honestly? It got the job done.'' \n \n Jesse was almost beside himself. `` Jesus, Mr. White. Jesus! I'm gon na have, like, post-traumatic stress from this.'' He massaged his face with both hands. `` Okay, yeah, it had to be done. But ca n't you at least show a little -- a little emotion or something? How can you just watch someone choke to death on their own puke and not give a shit?'' \n \n Walt stood. `` It's done, all right? What's done is done. If I could have used a poison that made Tuco lie down and die peacefully in his sleep, I would have. Now are you going to help me finish this or not?'' \n \n Jesse's eyes shot between Walt and Tuco's uncle, who was still ringing that bell. `` You do n't mean --'' Jesse began. \n \n Walt groaned. `` Use your head, Jesse. I would n't kill an invalid. I mean that we need to bury Tuco's body.'' \n \n `` Well -- okay, sure -- but what *about* him, huh? We ca n't just leave him here when we're done. We might as well kill him now if we do that.'' \n \n Walt held up a hand to stop Jesse yammering. `` When we get back to town,'' he said, `` I will phone the authorities and leave an anonymous tip that an old man has been abandoned here.'' He paused, thinking. `` And when we get home,'' he continued, `` we will go our separate ways, and we will never speak of this to anyone.'' \n \n Jesse joined Walt over Tuco's body. `` Go our separate ways,'' he laughed bitterly. `` Yeah. How many times am I gon na have to hear that one before it comes true?'' \n \n -- - \n \n Outside, Walt and Jesse dug frantically at the dusty, rocky Earth. It was hard going under a shimmering New Mexico sun and a cloudless sky. Walt had his shirt off, wrapped around his bald head like a turban. \n \n Jesse panted between words. `` This is -- bullshit --'' he said. His shovel clattered with each scoop he took. `` Why do I -- have to keep paying -- for your screwups?'' \n \n `` Shut up and dig,'' Walt grunted, too tired to argue. \n \n On the distance, Walt heard the crunch of gravel underneath tires, and the high-pitched squeal of an engine going silent. Walt knew Jesse must have heard it, too, because he stood up straight and his bright blue eyes went wide as saucers. \n \n The two men clambered out of the shallow grave. Tuco's body, half-wrapped in a sheet, lay beside it. The car was parked just around the corner of the house. \n \n `` Are those the cousins?'' Jesse said. `` They're not supposed to be here yet!'' \n \n Walt did a strange little dance, glancing this way and that, trying to work out the best thing to do. He could n't think of anything. On impulse he grabbed the assault rifle he had stolen from Tuco and peeked around the corner. \n \n The man who stepped out of the car was not one of Tuco's cousins, though. It was Hank. \n \n `` Jesse Pinkman!'' Hank said, shutting the door. `` You're a hard man to find. Come on out, I've got a few --'' \n \n As Hank rounded the corner, he stopped short. He locked eyes first with Walt, who was still holding the gun -- then with Jesse, who was a few paces behind -- and finally settled on the corpse of Tuco Salamanca. \n \n Hank and Jesse were mirror images: mouths hanging open in shock, stupefied, silent. \n \n Walt swallowed hard. He wiped his mouth with his free hand. `` Hi Hank,'' he said, shrugging.\n"}

Cpt. David \u201c DJ \u201d Gilbert, Jr. sits in the cargo bay at the rear of the plane. A handful of soldiers are seated around him, all strapped in to their seats and dressed in standard-issue desert gear. Gilbert raises his head from inspecting the bay floor and catches the man directly across from him eyeing Gilbert \u2019 s gear. His black and gray form-fitting body suit is remarkably different than the other soldiers \u2019 tan fatigues. Gilbert \u2019 s eyes are hidden behind a darkly tinted visor mounted on the front of his specially made helmet that comes down over both ears. The other men are curious, inspecting Gilbert \u2019 s comic book-like appearance, including the old-fashion click wheel iPod mounted on his left fore-arm. They \u2019 ve only heard rumors about Operation New Front, and now ONF \u2019 s prized product, code name Reverb, is sitting in their transport. \n \n A red light mounted near the rear bay doors begins to flash. Thirty seconds to drop. Two soldiers leave their seats and take up positions near the hatch controls. Gilbert stands as well and steadies himself against the bulkhead while he tugs at his collar. The body suit was built for purpose, not comfort. The R & D guys at ONF had perfect the sonic-distribution system and calibrated it to Gilbert based on a battery of tests. He grinds his teeth as the memories of months of training and testing flood his mind. It has been more than two years since he went under the needle for ONF, two years since he learned what their super soldier cocktail had turned him in to. \n \n One of the soldiers near the door knocks Reverb out of his reverie with a pat on the helmet. \n \n \u201c You read, Captain? \u201d, the grunt shouts. Reverb responds with a thumbs up and the soldier hits the switch. Cool Iraqi air blows in to the rear of the plane as the hatch opens. The still-seated soldiers squint against the gale force winds, intent on keeping eyes on this real-life super hero as long as they can. The grunt near the door holds up three fingers, counting down the last three seconds to launch. When the countdown is done, he points out the hatch. Reverb gives him a smile and leaps in to the night. \n \n Reverb free-falls through the air, which rushes by him with an incredible roar. He quickly presses a small button his fore-arm mounted controls, engaging the sound-negating headphones built in to his helmet. The world around him goes silent. The heads-up display on his visor blinks to life as he focuses on the ground rushing towards him. A lone bunker-type building near some hills is the only structure in the desert below. The visor marks it with a red indicator. His target. With the casual ease of practice, Reverb touches the click wheel on his iPod and hits play. The rolling guitar of [ AC\/DC \u2019 s Thunderstruck ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=v2AC41dglnM & feature=kp ) explodes out of his helmet headphones. He can feel the slight vibrating of his suit as it spreads the music \u2019 s frequency around his entire body. * \u201c Sound of the drums, Beating in my heart, The thunder of guns, Tore me apart. \u201d * The bunker continues it \u2019 s steady rush up at him while he free falls and listens to the lyrics. When he is only a few hundred feet from impact, Reverb spins in the air and points his feet down. He spreads his hands wide, then brings them together. * \u201c You \u2019 ve been\u2026 \u201d * When his hands meet it is with the sound of thunder. * \u201c THUNDERSTRUCK! \u201d * A brilliant flash of lightning races from his hands and strikes the exterior of the bunker, blowing a hole in the roof. \n \n Reverb spins the click-wheel again as he falls toward the entrance he just made for himself. The song in his ears changes abruptly. [ Titanium by David Guetta ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=JRfuAukYTKg ) erupts in his headphones and he feels his body change again. He rockets through the hole in the bunker's roof and when his feet hit the floor it is like a missile has struck it \u2019 s target. The floor explodes from beneath him and he continues down two more levels, ripping through cement floors like a titanium wrecking ball. His fall finally ends in the basement of the small facility, in a crater made by his impact. Reverb looks around, realizing that he is not alone. Half a dozen armed soldiers are strewn about the floor, recovering from the surprise entrance of the super soldier. Two to his left recover quickly, bring their assault rifles to bear and opening fire. \n \n * \u201c I \u2019 m bulletproof, nothing to lose \n Fire away, fire away \n Ricochet, you take your aim \n Fire away, fire away \u201d * \n \n The bullets bounce harmlessly off Reverb \u2019 s chest as he races at the shooters. He closes the distance quickly and disarms the stupefied guards with a flurry of kicks and punches. A quick survey of the other four guards show two struck dead by ricocheting bullets and the other two unconscious. Satisfied, he moves quickly toward a large steel door set in the western wall. The volume of his music subsides as voice comes over his communication system. \n \n \u201c Status, Captain? \u201d It is one of the soldiers back in the transport. The plane is still circling high above the bunker, waiting to extract Reverb once his mission is complete. \n \n \u201c Accessing the vault now, \u201d Reverb replies, examining the door \u2019 s access pad. He flicks to the next song on his iPod. The opening electronic note of [ Daft Punk \u2019 s Technologic ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=UoPplpBPQxQ ) rolls in to his head. \n \n * \u201c Buy it, use it, break it, fix it, \n Trash it, change it, mail \u2013 upgrade it, \n Charge it, point it, zoom it, press it, \n Snap it, work it, quick \u2013 erase it, \u201d * \n \n Reverb \u2019 s fingers go to work, his abilities taking over and pushing his normally tech-illiterate brain out of the way. In seconds the access pad flashes green and the steel door slides open. Reverb rushes in to the containment room, quickly finding the metal box his visor display identifies as the goal. He snags it off it \u2019 s pedestal and retreats to the crater he made in the bunker floor. The soft opening chords of [ R. Kelly \u2019 s I Believe I Can Fly ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=GIQn8pab8Vc ) seep in to his ears as he spots the transport plane high above. \n \n * \u201c I believe I can fly \n I believe I can touch the sky \n I think about it every night and day \n Spread my wings and fly away \u201d * \n \n Reverb keeps his hands tightly clasped to the metal box as he rises through the hole in the bunker's roof and glides the dry, desert night. \n \n\n"}

Of course this may be baffling to some, so I have Natasha Trotsky, paleontologist and founder of God, here to explain the details. * \n \n `` Well it all started with us searching for pre-Cambrian fossils when we came across an unusual structure below. At first we assumed it to be a volcanic formation, then some sort of meteorite, but after sever examination and several rounds of testing, I must admit this fossil belongs to some being of omnipotent power capable of creating Universes.'' \n \n *Can you give more explanation as to how you concluded this to be God? * \n \n `` My friend, Howard Gian, from the NASA program, was the one who first suggested it to be God. He was testing the material collected from the skeleton when he discovered that he was working with the very crystallized forms of love, faith, and amity. We knew that such structures could form if these emotions were place under extreme heat and pressure but never have we expected to deal with them first hand. After that it became obvious that this was something special.'' \n \n *How do you think he died? * \n \n `` From the autopsy, I say he was killed by a heart attack. As it turns out on the seventh day, he was not resting but had past away from stress. Humanity as a whole has been living in denial from his death, believing that he's somewhere out there still watching us. Now that we found him, we can move on and reach closure.'' \n \n *How will this affect science and religion as a whole? * \n \n `` Science is pretty embarrassed at the moment as it turns out the creationist were right. Not only did we find God but also the fossils of every creature imaginable surrounding him. Biology, physics, astrology, all must be revised with this new data. There are many religious people who still insist he is alive even though the central religious figures of the world came and admitted our evidence correct.'' \n \n *Thank you Natasha, like Nietzsche said, God is dead and we killed him. *\n"}

Barnabas shouted, the second my hand crested the peak of the mountain. Rolling my eyes I pulled myself up onto the small grassy area and came face go face with my mentor. \n \n He was the largest man I had ever seen at nearly eight feet tall with a pointed brown hat that stood another two feet by itself. A green cloak that must have been special made covered his long gaunt limbs and a bushy grey beard framed a sun tanned face. Brown, cat shaped eyes marked him a wizard and they were alight with merriment from today's training. \n \n `` Again, boy!'' He barked, staring me down. \n \n `` By Raloth's halo.'' I groaned, wiping bloody hands on my pants. `` I've jumped off this mountain onto the back of a dragon three times already. Do you know how sharp those scales are? And then I have to climb back up here even though you can let me fly!'' \n \n `` Listen here boy, do you think I'm going to be there to make you fly when you have to fight Forlorn, the black dragon? Because I wo n't be. So you need to know how to hang onto their scales with one hand while you stab it in the neck and kill it.'' \n \n `` I thougbt I was supposed to decapitate it?'' \n \n A hoarse bark of laughter left Barnabas' throat. `` Decapitate it? Are you daft Leon? We're not talking about a demon king here, you stab dragons in the neck. Everyone knows that.'' \n \n `` But-'' \n \n `` No buts, go jump off that cliff while you can do so of your own volition. Before I set this mountain ablaze and force you off. We're done for the day after this.'' \n \n Watching the flames kindle around his hands I stepped to the edge of the cliff. Dragon mountain was aptly named, through the grey clouds below me hundreds of them drifted lazily. \n \n `` I swear this does n't feel right.'' I muttered. Then smothered the feeling and jumped, pulling my short sword from its sheath as the winds whipped around me and I fell towards the waiting dragons. \n \n *** \n \n When I got back to the cottage, dragging the body of a cow behind me, Barnabas was there waiting. Night had fallen and he sat on and old tree stump around a small fire. A pair of spectacles were perched on his nose while he read a parchment letter and the dove that delivered it was perched on his shoulder. \n \n `` What's it say?'' I grunted, throwing the cow towards him. The training over the last year had been grueling but the strength was a nice bonus. \n \n `` Bad news boy.'' He said, levitating the cow and skewering it above the fire. `` The seer, Melindra, says Forlorn will appear above the capital in a fortnight. So pack your bags, we leave in the morning.'' \n \n I stared into the fire for long moments. `` So I will finally meet and slay Forlorn.'' I said finally, a sense of dread settling in my stomach. In all my dreams i had fought a demon the size of a building, his cruel laugh echoing. \n \n `` Are we sure it's a dragon?'' I asked and not for the first time. \n \n `` Bah. I've had enough of this question boy. Do you think Barnabas *He-Who-Guides* would train you to fight the wrong opponent?'' \n \n The wind picked up with his anger until it threatened to take down my small home. `` Of course not, sir. I know you've trained dozens of chosen ones. I'm just afraid of my destiny is all.'' \n \n `` As you should be Leon.'' \n \n *** \n \n It was as our wagon rounded the last corner towards the capital city of Lyptus that my sword caught fire, as it was meant to do when my destined for was close.

Barnabas shouted, spurring on the horses. `` Here we go Leon. I ca n't enter the city with you, it is against the prophecy. The fate of the world now relies on you young man.'' \n \n I whistled but did n't respond, young man was an improvement over boy. No reason to ruin the moment.

The demon king, here to usher in the apocalypse!'' \n \n Feeling the wagon stop, I looked back up to the sky and saw a humanoid shape with large black wings flapping as they slowed his fall. I opened my mouth, to say what I do n't know but it would've been nothing nice. But before I could speak a boot kicked me from the wagon and I ended on the dusty ground eating dirt. \n \n Spitting debris from my mouth I was in time to see Barnabas' wave. `` Good luck Leon! I need to get ready for the next chosen one!'' \n \n `` Damn wizards.'' I cursed and kicked open the city gates.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A game among aliens is to conquer other planets using the laws of that planet . Earth is their next target , but what they do n't realize is that our bureaucracy is a mess .\n","story":"We were in Australia where every action is slowed by bureaucracy. The aliens, starting out vagrants, planned to work their way up the ladder, until they were positioned to become Prime Minister of Australia. \n \n They landed in the suburb of Braddon. They found the social security office, and thought this was a good step towards wealth. The plan was acquiring wealth, so they would be able to pay their way into politics. They went into the social security office and there was a huge line. There were normal people in there. There was a girl with dreadlocks, and a bloke in white shirt and dress trousers. \n \n The alien's name was Christopher and his girlfriends, Susana. They had borrowed bodies, taking them from two degenerate humans, who used drugs. The man was sick looking, and, no lie, his body was sick and uncomfortable to live in. The girl had been pimped out by him, she'd gone through childbirth twice, which took it's toll despite the two children being underweight. Both had squinting, shrewd eyes. \n \n `` It seems we are supposed join the end of this row of people,'' said Christopher. \n \n `` This should be simple,'' said Susana. \n \n They waited in the line for two hours, which was n't that bad I suppose. When they got to the counter the bureaucrat said $ 250 would be in their banks each week. It would be enough to run a car, but the soles of your shoes would have to be worn down all the way before you got a replacement. Your clothes would be neat, but not passable to the more die hard fashionable people. For example, you could n't get Nike shoes, and a Nike shirt, because $ 100 is too much to spend. The most you could justify spending was $ 50 per item. However, this was with the best food - beef casserole, slow cooked chicken and the expensive bread. \n \n The fellow had some kind of liver ailment. The alien thought he needed to get this seen to, because because of this ailment he felt lethargic. He went to the health building, waited 4 hours, and it turned out he had a low level count on two liver enzymes. It was probably from drinking and sharing needles. Christopher still felt the urge, getting so depressed, to use drugs again. \n \n As soon as he got in the human's body, he dropped the White Ox, and upped his diet to a whole-food one. It was the sickness not the isolation that was making him so depressed. His mind was in a shambles. He was dejected, disillusioned and lonely. It was the chemistry of his liver not anything he was doing wrong socially. He'd met with the human's friends and the feeling persisted. It was n't Black Dog stuff, and he believed, suck it up, there's children with cancer in this world. \n \n He would go tomorrow to get the liver ultrasound done. He was going to do a six week fitness and personal training course, because this was the fastest way to move up the ranks. It was government funded. You had to fill out forms, but it was n't too bad. It only took two days to get the form back. He'd have to attend the Technical School's gym for 6 weeks. It was going to be good. Christopher had always been a curious alien, and he always had a strong desire to learn weightlifting form. He was a stickler for doing things correctly, and posture when doing weights was right up his ally. He also liked driving sensibly, so all the people behind him got the shits. It was the right thing to do, but people still did n't like it. \n \n He learnt how to spot weights. The course was good, but the gym was too small for all the people in the class. He tried to be assertive, but more often that not had to watch another person demonstrate. In addition, the students in the class talked when the teacher was speaking. Christopher wondered if he was hard of hearing, because he really had to strain to listen to the teacher over the talking students. His eyes were always tired too. \n \n Graduation day came. Susana watched proudly. Susana had worked 20 hours as a cleaner to supplement their income. It added $ 75 dollars to their income, after they'd reported at the social security reporting line. She did n't have any worker's credit, so she did n't get to earn $ 1000 before they started deducting money. However, it was Christopher's big day, because he was going to get his Certificate in Personal Training. He had shown up to class with next to no sleep 5 times. He did n't count, but that's how many. \n \n He saw the other students get up to receive their certificates. Then it was his turn. When he got down from the stage, Susana, with her chest out, kissed him roughly on the cheek. `` Well done, Christopher,'' she said. \n \n They got home that night and lay in bed. The bedside lamp on Susana's side was still on and filled the room with an soft glow. The window showed a sun burnt, frosty bush facade. It was moderately hard land, with poisonous insects, but not as bad as up north. There were funnel webs up there in Sydney. In the room, dejected, Christopher looked at the ceiling. \n \n `` Do you think we can be politicians,'' said Christopher. `` I mean, tomorrow I've got to get the job paper and look for a job, and even if I get the job we wo n't get much money. We need a job like accountant, or high up in the public service to think about being successful politicians. It seems here on planet Earth every move you make you have to fill out a form or wait in a line. It would take 20 years to be Prime Minster of Australia.'' \n \n `` I've realized something,'' said Susana. `` These humans need a good leader. I've grown quite attached to these humans, and think 20 years of hardship is worth it if we can help them, by being their leader. We'll slowly work our way up. You'll pay me through university, and then we'll make $ 2000 a week, rather than $ 1000, when I'm a physiotherapist, social worker, or psychologist. Then we can start to think about advertising ourselves for the Canberra elections. We can then run nationally, for our new, revolutionary party.'' \n \n `` Or we could just battle away,'' said Susana, `` and get a nice house one day. Maybe we could get one of those pet dogs, humans do n't appreciate enough. Yeah, we could have a house, and a pet dog, and we retire and work on the gardening in our spare time.'' \n \n `` That's a fun idea,'' said Christopher. He cuddled her, cupped her head in his girlfriend's hair, and kissed her on the cheek. Single handed, they had transformed two no-hopers into people who were at least giving it a try. It gave them perspective; they realized the no-hopers were n't entirely bad people, but they'd moved on from that; they were positive people, who now offered something instead of taking. They'd gone a long way, but the majority of the journey was still to come. \n THE END.\n"}

''\n","story":"It was June 1st, 2015 when they opened the sky above our home. The world remembers the day the Veck invasion started, but for me, it was also the day my daughter was born. As plasma scorched the heavens, my world was changing in a hospital delivery room. \n \n I was 39 years old, too old to be drafted, but when the world is at war, the Army can find something for you to do. Four years into the war I was considered an oddity, the casualty rate had been damn near 75 %, but I had been lucky so far. I had a bit of skill building and repairing networks and it had kept me out of combat. Hell, I even got to Skype my family now and then, they had made it back into the Midwest and were staying with my folks. \n \n I was always worried about our daughter Ally though, she never talked, just watched her videos and looked at her picture books. The doctors said it had something to do with the radiation that the Veck's used in their propulsion systems, it was affecting children across the globe. Developmental disorders and birth defects were very common, but one doctor in particular was hopeful as she had escaped the front early on. \n \n I was in the basement of what had once been a strip club trying to keep communications up for my regiment when the second wave hit Atlanta. They tore a wormhole open half a mile wide, and soldiers from H. R. Giger's nightmares poured out. The United Nation troops that I was assigned to fought tooth and nail, hand to hand combat in some places when the shock troops poured into the green zone. I was going to die in the heat and humidity of Atlanta 850 miles from where I was born. \n \n As they burst through the ground floor windows I could hear the mixed gunfire of my troops, I went about the task of setting the explosives. I was under strict and direct orders to not allow our encryption software to fall into the hands of the enemy. I could n't hit the broad side of a barn if I was standing inside it, but at least I could do this final task. Sweat poured down my face as I went about my grim final actions and I could hear the unearthly screams of the metal and flesh beasts as they tore apart my friends. \n \n The temperature in the storeroom where I had spent the last six months suddenly dropped, I frantically spun around from attaching the last of the cables to the C4 to come face to face with a small teenage girl whose green eyes pierced my soul. At that moment the fortified doors burst open, and half a dozen steel demons burst forth hellbent on destruction. As I stood I grabbed the detonator and whispered, `` God forgive me'' and slammed on button, but nothing happened. \n \n The girl looked up to me and in a hauntingly beautiful voice she sang, `` Do you want to build a snowman?'' \n \n We had been seen and the beasts were coming for us, I frantically pushed the button again and again, but once again, nothing. The girl turned and for the first time I saw what she was holding, it looked like a flashlight, but when she thumbed the side of it, a very distinctive humming came from and a beam of solid blue light emanated from it. `` Come on let's go and play!'' her melodic voice continued and she leaped into battle. \n \n It was a slaughter, she moved faster then I could follow, but before she could finish `` I never see you anymore, come out the door, it's like you've gone away.'' There was nothing but a pile of severed limbs and heads and she was gone out the smashed in doorway. In shock, I looked down and found out why I was still alive, I had n't connected the last wire. \n \n I grabbed my sidearm and rushed up the stairs, they were slick with melting snow. As my vision adjusted to the blinding light, I had a hard time understanding what I was seeing. The Veck were being pushed back, but not by tanks and jets. A serpent dragon that I could have sworn was tattooed on the back of a Japanese soldier I had lost 3 days of desert to a few weeks ago was fighting alongside what could have only been a 12 foot tall and feral form of Winnie the Pooh. Harry Potter and Wolverine were back to back holding off what had to be a dozen Veck. My Little Pony characters were feasting on the flesh of both man and beast like some rainbow colored Mares Of Diomedes. My body and mind decided in unison that they had enough, and I woke up 8 days later in a hospital in Des Moines, Iowa. \n \n Within hours of awaking, I was being debriefed by a Brigadier-General and his staff who were very interested in my accounts of what was to be known as the first battle of `` The Children's Crusade''. After being grilled for 4 hours on my experiences in Atlanta there was a knock on the door, and a nurse whispered `` his family is here''. I have never seen so much brass move that quickly and they ushered in my wife and daughter. \n \n My wife wept and told me how great it was to see me again, even if it was in a hospital and she sat my Ally at the foot of my bed. She clutched a 30+ year old Princess Leia figure that my folks must have dug out of my childhood closet, looked at me with her big green eyes, and for the first time spoke. `` Do you want to build a snowman?'' It got very quiet, and the July heat was drained from the room.\n"}

Rejection had never come easy to me, which is why I never put myself out there. It was why I had made it through high school without a girlfriend.

My heart jumped as I looked up and was met with two radiant, blue eyes. \n \n `` We need to talk,'' she was whispering again yet she still managed to sound urgent. I dumbly nodded my head and she dragged me into the manager's office. She shut the door behind us and glanced quickly around the room. \n \n `` Uh... What...'' She never let me finish. \n \n `` There is no time. Look, I really like you. I know I was short with you the other day but I promise it was for the right reasons.'' She liked me. That was all I could hear, echoing in my mind over and over. She liked me! \n \n `` Oh... So, what reasons?'' My mind barely churned out any thought. \n \n `` I need you to understand, I do n't involve people in my life. It is just too dangerous. I can never stay in a place for too long. It might be a few days or weeks, but sooner or later they always find me.'' A strand of brilliant red hair bounced across the bridge of her nose. Her eyes captured me. They were deep as the ocean. `` I have to leave today.'' \n \n `` No!'' It was out before I could register. `` You ca n't.'' \n \n `` I have to. I wish I could explain. We don \u2019 t have time right now. I want to. I just... I have been so alone. I'm so tired of never having anyone. I know it is n't fair and part of me hopes you will say no... But...'' Her eyes welled with tears. I was truly drowning in them now. \n \n I could hardly think. Could I leave my family? Give up everything I knew? For who, the pretty girl I understood nothing about? None of that mattered though. I knew before she asked what I would do. I was never very good at saying no anyway. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ TT ] [ IP ] Somber Castle\n","story":"Life is grey, so far North. \n \n Even this early in the afternoon the sun was already well past its zenith, sinking slowly through the banks of darkling cloud towards the horizon, its pale rays washing out what little colour there was left in these old, stone walls. \n \n No one comes here now; not for years. No life, no laughter, save the jeering of the ravens as they wheel overhead, and the silent judgement of the grass fighting for life between the ever-widening cracks of these broken flagstones. I watch them sometimes, as I roam these abandoned halls; watch them chase one another to first one tower then the next in their eternal and pointless game of musical chairs. There was always one to land at the very top, confidently soaring on high to land precisely on the gargoyle's wing, as if impudently defying nature to blow him off of his self-appointed throne. But she never did: it was always another raven, a contender to the old lord that came to take his place, casting him down. How ironic, after all this time, the ravens were acting out a playful mockery of the machinations that brought the castle to its knees. \n \n Below those twin lofty peaks the winding corridors and immense halls spread out under the gaze of the gargoyles, their eyes as sharp as ever they had been, scrying out every new detail to be had in this sterile place. In the main hall, bereft of its roof, an insolent talon disloges a pebble from a ruined vault, and the watchers observe its fall through the air, to land with the harsh chink of stone on stone, bouncing a few meters to finish its course nestled in a clump of weeds. It would likely remain there until the end of time, undisturbed, forgotten, brought low by mere unhappy chance. A story the gargoyles knew too well: strewn at the foot of the towers lay several of their brethren. Would that I could help them, but... I can not. High up on the vault the raven remains oblivious to his actions. And why should he not, indeed. This place holds no meaning for him, no more than does the rock on which it is built, or the mountain on the horizon. It is his home, to do with as he pleases, unencumbered with the past or the future. The purpose of the pebble he brought down is no more, the roof is gone, why should the pebble not follow suit? He is right: it is a fitting end... \n \n There is no life in me now. I am as dead as this castle. A captain goes down with his ship, they say, and so the king is entombed within the walls of his kingdom. Ghosts and memories are all that remain of me and mine, but which one am I? I can no longer tell. Perhaps I was that king. Perhaps I am nothing more that what these old walls knew of him. `` If these wall had ears,'' people used to say. Maybe they do.\n"}

The Sufis back home had once told him: the only path to enlightenment is that of the hermit. \n \n So he followed the trail of the hermit crab and shuffled off to sea, until he found a home that fit. \n \n The Island. \n \n *It \u2019 s just as well, * he thought, looking out onto the pillars of smoke that rose from beyond the horizon. *It seems as though the rest of the world is disappearing. * \n \n *** \n \n They were three hours out of the blast zone when the shockwave finally caught up with them. \n \n Davis pressed his hat to his head and ducked back inside the vehicle. \n \n John and Lucas were up in the driver \u2019 s pit, and Manuel was stacking boxes in the back. \n \n \u201c Typical Bearclaw.

We \u2019 re going to have to take care of our own. \u201d \n \n *** \n \n Yousef \u2019 s days went on much the same as before. \n \n The distant mushrooms had changed nothing. \n \n He rose with the sun and sat on his favorite rock at the waterfall. The water was cold, and it turned a groggy, foggy world into pure lucid crystal. He was awake. \n \n With that he climbed to the peak of the central mountain, where a crater still smoked and bubbled. In the rolling waves of heat he sat and contemplated God, the Universe, and all of the people in it. \n \n Those three, of course, were the same thing. \n \n When his belly started to grumble he trekked down the slope and gave a palm tree a mighty kick, catching a coconut in mid-flight. \n \n He went to his favorite sharp stone, and bashed the fruit until the milk leaked out like liquid pearl. \n \n Yousef brought it to his mouth and drank. \n \n One would think that eating the same thing for years on end would drive a man to madness\u2014but not Yousef. \n \n When he drank his fill he ripped open the coconut and peeled the insides, tasting the hearty flesh. \n \n Delicious, always delicious. \n \n In his garden was a scaffold of tomatoes and carrots, along with a few nuts he \u2019 d found. \n \n A small black bird was worrying at a tomato and ripping it off the vine. \n \n \u201c Oh hello, \u201d he said, his eyes wrinkling with a smile. \n \n The bird jumped back and chirped a reply, before going back to work. \n \n \u201c It does you no good to be so prideful! \u201d Yousef admonished. \u201c It is okay to ask for help. \u201d He reached down and pulled the fruit off the vine. \n \n The bird chirped a thank you and flew off into the canopy. Yousef tried a tomato himself and relished in the juices, and the taste of a full stomach finally overcame him. \n \n He went to the beach to listen to the tides. The salt and sand had scarred his skin and pitted them beyond repair, but still he could not resist the profound beauty of the seas. \n \n They were deep, clean, infinite. \n \n Yet they licked up the land like a shy bride, forever coming close and falling back again. \n \n The water foamed. \n \n Beautiful. \n \n *** \n \n \u201c Water, \u201d he said. \n \n \u201c What about it? \u201d Davis had been asking Lucas about possible safe zones, and all of a sudden he \u2019 d started talking nonsense about water. \u201c What the fuck are you talking about? \u201d \n \n \u201c Water dissipates radiation. I remember that, because that \u2019 s what they stick around reactor cores and shit. \u201d \n \n \u201c And? \u201d \n \n Lucas pointed out to the ocean. \u201c What I \u2019 m saying is, radiation can \u2019 t go out that far. Because there \u2019 s *water. * What we need to do is find a nice island, and then we can settle down. \u201d \n \n Davis put the cap back on his head. \u201c Alright, sounds good. There should be some docks about a mile down. Hopefully there are a few boats left. \u201d \n \n He climbed into his truck, and the rest of the team climbed into theirs. They had enough supplies to last more than a lifetime, pilfered from abandoned and some not-so-abandoned storehouses. \n \n With a single pull of the horn they were off towards Shuwaikh port. Shipping lines ended there: which must \u2019 ve made for some *big* fuckin' boats. \n \n They arrived in less than an hour, which was magnificent considering the amount of rubble and scrap on the roads. \n \n Davis got out his truck, and\u2014 \n \n *BANG. * \n \n Gunshot to the west, spark off the hood of his rig, and the pinging ring of a ricochet. \n \n \u201c They \u2019 re firing on us! \u201d \n \n Lucas jumped out the truck and got behind the cover of the trailer. \u201c No shit they \u2019 re firing on us. \u201d \n \n \u201c *Why?! * \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s the end of the world, son. Everyone \u2019 s in survival mode. And that means killin \u2019. \u201d \n \n *** \n \n \n In the recent months, Yousef had been granted a gift: \n \n It seemed as if all the birds and swimming turtles of the world had come to his little island, hungry for food. He \u2019 d been planting trees and vegetables for a long time, and there was more than enough for their hungry stomachs. \n \n \u201c Come, come! \u201d he said. Many of them seemed shy, but after a few days they would perch on his shoulders or nuzzle him as he slept at night. \n \n \u201c Ah, \u201d he smiled. \u201c To be so lucky! \u201d \n \n It was good to have the noise of life be so strong around him, again. It wasn \u2019 t distracting, either: it made his heart soar even in the depths of meditation. Things were simply *good, * and he was grateful. \n \n During the mornings he would sit on the beach and look for newcomers. The Island had three sides ringed in sheer cliffs, but the third was soft sand where the creatures could make their landings. And there, he directed them along their proper paths. \n \n \u201c Why hello, bird! \u201d He pointed the exhausted creature towards the roost of his own species, close by and to the North. \u201c There you are! \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh, welcome, wise Turtle! \u201d Yousef offered him some seaweed and sent him off towards the coves. \n \n \u201c Why, hello, little lizard! \u201d He picked up the limp and tired creature and rubbed its head. \u201c Did you swim all this way? \u201d \n \n Yousef walked him to the comfort of the shade and let him loose beside a pool of stagnant water, where he could feed on the insects. \u201c You will be alright, here, I think! \u201d \n \n And then he went back to the beach, to await his next visitors. \n \n It was a beautiful day. \n \n *** \n \n \u201c Goddamn, Lucas, it \u2019 s been ages. \u201d \n \n Lucas looked back at him with a furrowed brow. \u201c What are you complaining about, huh? The food you eat every day? The fresh water you still have access to? \u201d He slammed a hand down on a metal rail. \u201c You \u2019 re living like a king out here. \u201d \n \n Davis was still sea-sick. He couldn \u2019 t help it. \n \n \u201c Take some fucking dramamine, you pussy. \u201d \n \n Manuel was cleaning their guns. Never knew when you might need them. But he looked up from a polish to say, \u201c I agree, though, man. I \u2019 d prefer to have some land under my feet. Something *still*, you know? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, we \u2019 re looking for a place where that land won \u2019 t be irradiated for a fuckin \u2019 century. Somewhere clear of the dust clouds, too. \u201d \n \n Manuel shut up and went back to work. \n \n And then there was the call. \n \n * \u201d Land! \u201d * John yelled from upstairs, finally bursting belowdecks and shouting into the living quarters: \u201c Land! \u201d \n \n They rushed off to the deck and got a good sight of it: a big island with a smoking volcano sitting dead center, surrounded by cliffs. \n \n \u201c How the hell are we going to get on it? There \u2019 s cliffs everywhere. \u201d \n \n Lucas squinted in that frozen way of his and gave a simple command, \u201c Sail all about it. There has to be an opening. \u201d \n \n Thirty minutes later and John was smiling at the helm. \u201c You were right, captain. Beach up ahead. I \u2019 ll anchor at the reef. \u201d \n \n \u201c Good. \u201d \n \n Davis had been peering through a rifle scope. \u201c Uh, sir? \u201d \n \n Lucas grit his teeth. \u201c *Yes*\u2026? \u201d \n \n \u201c This island already seems to be inhabited. \u201d \n \n Lucas grabbed the rifle and took a look down the sights. Some wrinkled old beef jerky of a man was sitting naked on the beach, smiling like a jackass. \u201c They look like primitives. Can \u2019 t stand some good old firepower, it looks like. \u201d He handed back the rifle. \n \n \u201c So\u2026? \u201d \n \n \u201c So we take them out and set up. This looks as good a place as any. \u201d \n \n Davis nodded. \n \n \u201c So what are you waiting for? \u201d \n \n Davis shot him a puzzled look. \u201c What *am* I waiting for? \u201d \n \n \u201c The takeover starts *now. * Take the shot. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh, okay. \u201d Davis put his eye back to the scope and braced the stock against his shoulder. He set the tripod nice and steady on a metal beam and lined up the shot. \n \n Lucas grinned. \u201c This \u2019 ll be easy as shitting in a bucket, you \u2019 ll see. Fighting a bunch of savages, heh. Alright: breathe, breathe, breathe\u2026 \u201d Lucas shielded his eyes from the sun. \u201c Take the shot. \u201d \n \n Davis pulled the trigger. \n \n *** \n **END** \n\n"}

I looked down at my hand to see where the mark had been gradually creeping up my arm. Now my arm, up to my elbow, was as black as a crow; my arm had gone limp.

He told me gleefully. He came to unstrap my arms, probably figuring that I was left without strength. But something inside of me took on a new animal strength. When he unstrapped my arms I fell to the floor, but when he bent down to pick me up I leaped up and bit his neck. He tried to scream but my teeth quickly crushed his trachea. I stood up and walked outside as though I had n't just been tortured for several days. \n \n I saw a guard who had fallen asleep in the shade. I bit his neck as well, then left him to bleed out in the sand. I took his weapon out of its holster. I examined the small pistol, but then I tossed it into a nearby pit. Guns are not who I am now. I walked over to another tent and saw another of my torturers with 2 other men. They seemed shocked to see me, so shocked that I got the jump on them and bit the neck of the closest man to me. The other 2 immediately reacted by pulling out swords. I grabbed the blade of the other man with my hand, slicing a huge gash in my fingers, but I barely felt it. He could not stop the rage building inside me as I destroyed his throat as well. \n \n There was just one man left, my last living torturer. I lunged at him and he stuck out his sword, impaling me. I brought down my fist with all my might and broke his wrist. He let go of the sword and I grabbed him and bit his neck. I did n't stop biting until there was little left. He slumped to the ground, and I quickly followed him there. We lay on the ground next to each other dying. `` It is your own fault,'' I whispered to him. `` You never should have made me an animal.'' With that we passed into the night.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Tell the origin story of the most awesome or most interesting character you can imagine .\n","story":"I do n't know who I am. \n \n As my eyes open for seem like the first time, I look around the cave I'm in. How did i get here, I ask myself, before realizing that I can not speak. Alone in my thought. I attempt to take my pulse. Nothing there, somehow. I check my person for any sort of supplies, anything that could help me get out of here. No luck, so I begin to look around my cave. \n \n At first glance, it was just an empty room. No way out, at least from what I can see. Panic begins to set in. What if I never get out? Does anyone know where I am? More importantly does anyone know I'm here? I notice that there is a gust from above me. Scaling the side of the wall I find my way above my resting place. A dark passageway stands between me and a possible way out. Trembling with fear of not knowing, I enter the passage. \n \n Coming out of the room, I look left and right. Cave in to my right, the way that leads up. Desperate to explore my cell, I begin to head down the path of the cave. I look around the cave to try to find any hints where I am. The biology of the cave does n't help me. All i can see are generic small bats that attempt to swoop at me as if I am holding a basket of fruit. Eventually I come across what seems like a hut, if you could call it that. The mouth of the hut looked like a sort of animalistic mouth, nearly all black. Thats when I hear what sounds like a person....talking inside. \n \n I attempt to scream out to anyone that could be out there, but I remember: I cant talk. Inside the cabin is the source of the voice. A man with unkept hair, surrounded by empty cans and reeked with alcohol lay passed out in the center of the room. I attempt to wake him by pushing and poking him, but he does not give off any sort of reaction except the occasional groan. Left with no other options, I search for something that might help me escape this hell. His `` home'' was entirely empty, except for a few crates scattered around the man, probably alcohol. Luckily enough inside one of the crates is a small pistol. Engraved on it is an etching of the North Star, Polaris. I really did n't enjoy the idea of stealing, but I mad a silent oath to myself that one day I would find this man and return it. I turn around and leave the man behind and try to leave to cave. \n \n Back to where I started, I search the cave in once more. Oddly enough, it seems more... delicate than it did before. Just by shooting it with my gun, which I've appropriately named `` Polar Star'' at this point, I an able to break free farther into the cave. Eager to have possibly found a way out, I take a step into the newly discovered portion of the cave. \n \n It was then I realized my mistake. \n \n I should have checked my step before I entered this portion. The weakened flooring crumbles as I fall through the floor, and I remember one thing. \n \n My name is Quote. \n \n Also- this is my first post on this sub so I will take any advice and\/or criticism!\n"}

As he inched forward, his hands clasped together, praying to God and pleading with his daughter's captors, the wind was suddenly knocked out of him, as a guard's boot slammed into his face, throwing him backwards onto the cold marble floor.

Make sure to pay next month.'' He smirked, before turning towards his bedchamber. \n \n All too soon the General stood alone, naked, with the girl beside his bed. `` Undress.'' He commanded her, and watched hungrily as she reluctantly began to remove her dress. \n \n `` What is the matter!?'' The General suddenly shouted, as the guard, who had kicked the girl's father down only minutes earlier, walked into the room and stood before him.

Filthy xenos filth, I thought as I brought myself to my knees. They would pay for their crimes. The Emperor would make sure of it. Why, the peoples of Terra must be amassing at this very moment\u2026 \n My train of thought was derailed by the blunt growl of the monstrous jailor, the only word the thing could utter being, \u201c Move. \u201d \n The beast brought me down the corridor, his every mangled sentence an insult to the Terran language. I would have resisted, but after weeks in the prison cell, I had become too emaciated to fight back. I hung limply, dragged by the brute strength of the alien \u2019 s uncultured and filthy arms. Finally, we came to a large chamber. \n Unlike the magnificent courts of Terra, in which swift justice befell the leaders of the Collective \u2019 s hordes, the alien judgment chamber was sparse, a rigid and savage testament to the barbaric artlessness that so characterized the foul xenos scum who were about to sentence me to death. \n I spat on the plastic ground, defiant against my oppressors. The action elicited gasps of shock from the gathered masses. The judge, however, remained calm, quiet, peaceful. To hell with him, the serene fucker! I peeled back my fingers to my palm, making the glorious Terran symbol of righteous battle, the solitary middle finger pointed to the heavens. \n The thin grey judge merely shrugged. \u201c Fellows, do you not see why we should have pity on this creature? \u201d it spoke to the assembled jury. \u201c He is uneducated, unaware of what he has done. I recognize your cries for swift justice, but to resort to execution is to resort to barbarism of a human level! \u201d \n \u201c Xenos scum! \u201d I shouted. Rage boiled through me, my veins spasming in agony at the jab at my species. I rose to attack the judge, but a quick stab of pain in my neck told me that the monstrous guard had administered a relaxant through his syringe gun. \n Barely stymied by my outburst, the judge spoke onwards. \u201c This specimen is a brainwashed soldier, cannon fodder for an evil empire that he does not understand! How was he to know that the payload he dropped on the Hiran system was a singularity bomb? If we are to fight the ideological scourge of this human axis of evil, we must extend relative leniency towards its most abused citizens! For how can we argue that this man has been abused by his so-called \u2018 benevolent Emperor \u2019? Starved and uneducated as the Emperor cavorts in a private paradise! Made to kill his fellow man in the name of the Terran will! I have only pity for such a man. \u201d \n A voice spoke from the crowd: \u201c But Chancellor, he caused over a billion deaths! He must pay. \u201d \n For the first time, the judge raised his voice. \u201c I sense vengeance in your town, Representative! To stoop to vengeance is to be positively\u2026 human. \u201d He spat the word out like an insult. The crowd recoiled, apparently disgusted by something the judge had said. \n \u201c Yes, I do say \u2018 human \u2019! I would have us all remember that we are not inherently beyond the barbarism of the people of Terra! Yet we have conditioned ourselves to forsake vengeance, while they only strive to give in to it. It is only through pity and a true desire to heal that we will ever uplift the once great human race! \u201d \n Once-great? The Collective never acknowledged human greatness, not in all the history of the war\u2026 \n \u201c Comrades, brethren! These warlike savages were once our allies, our greatest benefactors and strongest friends! They may be redeemed, if only their foul Emperor is done away with. \u201d \n Such talk was heresy, but I wanted to hear more. What was this talk of a former alliance between xenos and homo sapiens? \n \u201c Thus, I suggest a new strategy in war. No more attacks on the Imperial military! No more sad, brainwashed men need die before realizing the error of their ways! We will strike at the core of the Imperium itself. If that means purging the Imperial capitol in fire, so be it! The price is too high to let the Emperor remain in power one moment more! Cut loose this devolved prisoner, and join me in the liberation of humanity! \u201d \n There was a great hurrah from the stands, and for a moment I finally grasped the gravity of the situation. This was no criminal trial. This was a government meeting. For all of my struggle, I had been thrown aside, regarded only as a device in some xenos politician \u2019 s speech. Tears came to my eyes, and I found myself unable to stay awake. As the sedative that the guard had administered began to come into effect, my mind dimmed, until my only thought was a memory of something our Eternal Leader the Emperor had once said: \u201c Mankind has grown strong in eternal struggles and it will only perish through eternal peace. \u201d The words of his Majesty calmed me at last, and in moments, I was enveloped in darkness. \n\n"}

The walls still have their glow and the computer's hooked to the TV screen, just like it had been last time. \n \n Then comes the knock, three oppressive thuds on a frail door frame. I shimmy, slide, flick the lock and slide back the wood. She's there, dangling locks, crop top and black skirt. Eyes meet for an instant, she's cool calm collected, reflecting my own, and I wave her in with a smile. Her gaze lights up like I've flicked the switch and one, two, three steps later she's on the couch with my laptop in hand. Exactly like it happened *then*. \n \n `` Long day?'' She clicks on her favourite show and watches the TV buffer. \n \n `` Tiring.'' I say. \n \n Matter of fact I was sitting here, on this couch. Wondering if I would be an idiot two times in a row. Second chances worked sometimes -- hopefully. \n \n She smiles and my whole world warms. It's like a drug and god dammit I'm addicted. `` Well, come on then, blankie time?'' She pats the seat next to her twice. \n \n I snap open the blanket cupboard and nearly pick the same one, cool blue and supple fur. Brown seems better this time, it's a duvet more than a blanket -- no one cares. `` How was your day?'' I ask in return. \n \n She shifts her head side to side. `` It was alright... there's been a lot on my mind...'' \n \n My heads doing the agreeing, but my eyes take in every second of this moment. The way her maroon lips move, her hand gestures, the shiver of her hair. I still do n't understand how I could hurt something so innocent, that trusts me this much. `` You've got a plan?'' I say. She's like that. \n \n `` Sort of,'' she says. The smile on her lips tell me not to worry. \n \n The blanket goes over and she's snuggled up as The Mentalist plays on the TV screen. We get cozy and press up, find each other's feet in the warmth of our improvised tent. \n \n She presses pause on the laptop. `` We need to talk.'' \n \n This is the fuzzy part, in fact, it's where things went wrong last time. I try to keep my head above the clouds. `` Talk about?'' \n \n There's a gap between us. It was n't there before. This is bad. \n \n `` Just promise not to get mad...'' \n \n Really bad. The guilty always start out with unfulfillable promises. \n \n `` Fine.'' It's all I can manage. \n \n Her hands go through her hair, locks dangle toward touching knees, and then she covers her face. I sit in the silence with The Mentalist staring at me. He's trying to tell me to think this time, that I'm here for a reason. The last six months went by in a flash and I've lived every hug, kiss, and hand holding moment over again. \n \n She sniffs. `` There's something I've done and... you never caused it, this was just my own... stupidity.'' \n \n It's coming to me now, it's not something I want to hear twice. I stand up and walk to the door. But she does n't let me. \n \n `` Tim, I've slept with someone else.'' \n \n There it is. Hearing it the second time changes nothing. The hairs on the back of my neck go up, my mind goes dark, and knuckles are blazing white. I rotate, meet her gaze full of fear, and step forward. \n \n She puts a hand up like I'm going to punch her from this far away. \n \n It's still there, how doing it made me feel last time. It's worse than the regret that her words surfaced. Worse than the twisted knot in my chest that caused the ache in my throat and the heat behind my eyes. There were only so many options when it came to fulfilling a broken heart. Revenge is the simplest one. \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' she says. \n \n I want to kill her. \n \n But the door is still there. \n \n It had been a faded memory last time, her only escape. This time it was mine. There were enough broken hearts in the world, and plenty more broken people. \n \n The hallway outside stoked whatever flames had been blazing before. `` I want you gone by the time I'm back.'' \n \n Her tears softened my resolve. `` Please...'' \n \n That path led to pain, hate, distrust. `` Twenty minutes.'' There were always other roads. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

I was a desperate man. As a 24 year old virgin with a severe cowlick I had tried everything. \n \n As I lazily read the pages and glanced around for a distraction I saw that my neighbor had left without taking his neon orange hipster glasses. Something about those glasses made the guy look so cool and confident. I could never pull them off. Then Neil said it on page 13, \u201c you have to stand out like a peacock if you want to attract attention. \u201d Maybe those glasses were exactly what I needed. \n I grabbed the glasses as I headed for the door to sit outside for a smoke. \n \n They felt odd on my face, it wasn \u2019 t just the color or the style. These glasses seemed to know what I was looking at and adjust to it. Fast moving objects like cars seemed to slow down for me to get a better look. It felt crazy, but I could almost swear that the glasses knew what I wanted to see and helped me see exactly that. That \u2019 s when he sat dawn. \n \n I looked over at my new neighbor on the lone bench in the smoking area and a sharp looking guy was sitting next to me. It started with a name to the right of his face appearing in dark letters against the grey concrete. \n \u201c Todd Foster \u201d \n \n I looked away, what the hell was that\u2026 \n \n I took a drag from my Pall Mall and a sip of my latte. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s up Todd? \u201d I said. \n \n \u201c Oh not much, just fighting off this hangover.

Anyway, good to see you. \u201d \n \n As I stood up to leave I looked back at Todd and saw the text appear again, \n \u201c Financially solid, likes cats, plays guitar and soccer \u201d \n \n I went and sat back down inside.

I was trying to crack the formula for finding someone, when I needed to be improving myself. \n \n I put the glasses back on the table; someone would be back for them and I didn \u2019 t need that kind of drama.

Id love if any of you who may read it leave an opinion or correction on how i wrote, Im not an English speaker by birth. \n \n ________________________________ \n \n \n Generations have passed since the old prophecy was spoken. It was the first Loredas in Sun's Dawn when the old crone that lived in the Jerall mountains came down to my family \u2019 s lost lands. She entered the town disheveled and spewing what we once thought to be madness. \n \n \u2026 \n \n \n The fire flickered, illuminating the face of the man staring into it. The face of a man consumed, deep bags and bloodshot eyes were the few colors to paint his face. The skin stretched against his cheekbones as if nothing laid between them. \n \n \n Three men stood before this man, across from the fire. They observed a man who on all accounts had to be dead on his feet, stare mindlessly at the bonfire with nervous glances. The three found themselves unable to move but for scared glimpses between themselves. \n \n \n \u201c Shh\u2026 now, calm down. You \u2019 ll waste the fire if you keep fretting and thinking like that. Id wish to be able to finish my story with an audience still alive, I rarely get to tell it. \u201d The ghoul of man whispered in the faintest of sounds. \n \n \n Whimpers came from the three men. \n \n \n \u201c Where was I now? \u201d \u201c Ahh! Yes, yes, of course. The exiled witch of the coven of Namira \u201d \n \n \n \u2026 \n \n \n The crone entered the town heading towards my old family \u2019 s estate two hours before midnight. She was shivering with cold, clothes torn and stained with blood. As she raced through the town, her wild shrieks and clamors woke those she passed by. Same way as a wave she pulled them behind her, an unstoppable force. \n \n \n As she reached the main square, half the town was following her a few stone \u2019 s throw behind her and my father and I, came out of the long house as well. There she started with an audience rapt with curiosity and morbid fascination. \n \n \n \u201c I have seen it, I have! Seen the end, the beginning. The beginning of the end. You will find nothing in the moon for she has told me with a voice like whispering thunder! The moon is a lie. The end it told me. Oh! The bones were clear, it \u2019 s the beginning. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Enough! \u201d My father shouted. \n \n \n \u201c Guards! Throw this dammed cannibal into the dungeon, we have no reason to hear the blasphemies of the mad and their demons! This witch is to be burned in the morning. \u201d \n \n \n The town roared in unison in the prospect of some more entertainment to be had in the morning. They started to shout insults and depravities at the old crone in pure elation of the prospect. I didn \u2019 t realize it at the time but as the guards dragged the old witch away, her screams of frustration drowned out by the crowd, that \u2019 s when it first happened for me. That \u2019 s the first time I saw my father be wrong. I learned that day that your friends teach you want you want to know but your enemies, they teach you what you need to know. \n \n \n I slipped that night into the dungeon. I was curious of the old crone and I guess at the time I wanted to prove to myself I was as brave as my father wanted me to be. I walked down the crumbling old steps with a candle to light my way. The dungeon was cold and moist, water droplets dripping from the ceiling. It was as dark as it could, the only light coming from my candle and a small barred window to let the air out of the underground cells. \n \n \n I peered into the nearest cell to me but I could barely see into it. A chill ran down my spine as I inched closer and closer towards the cell. My nerves were almost about to give when the old crone grabbed me. Her hand shot towards me from the dark as fast as a hawk \u2019 s flight. She gripped me with strength I would not believe of an old woman and as I screamed for help she pulled me ever so close to the bars of the cell. There as continued to scream she whispered into my ear. \n \n \n \u201c You have to help me, it \u2019 s you and me now! If you don \u2019 t help me escape the flames will consume us all! It \u2019 s the beginning, the darkness will come and steal the souls from within us, it will leave us poor and the fire will eats us whole, then it will be the end! I have your blood and the pact is done, help me escape! \u201d \n \n \n I felt a strong slice in my wrist and as my blood started to flow the guards rushed into the dungeon, prying me open and escorting me out. \n \n \n \u2026 \n \n \n The old husk of a man stretched its arm and threw another log into the dying bonfire, sparks flew rising up into the air, dancing with the smoke in a hypnotic ballet. As they continued to rise they turned into purple smoke which floated towards the three men across from him. As they breathed the smoke, they were shaken from their reverie, life and will flowing back through them. \n \n \n \u201c Please, help us \u201d one of them cried out. \n \n \n \u201c Put more please, free me \u201d shouted another. \n \n \n \u201c Now, now I aint done with my story and it is mighty rude too interrupt a man my age. Shut up or I will never come feed your fire again. \u201d \n \n \n The three men went as silent as stone, tears flowing down their eyes. \n \n \n \u2026 \n \n \n That night nightmares plagued my dreams. A thousand fires dancing around me, eating at me. Humans like puppets chasing after me. Tearing at me. Pleading, crying, scared and tormented. And so it continued until dawn broke. \n \n \n A few hours passed as cold sweat drenched me and my bed until the time for the burning came. The town came together in the main square and the stake was erected. The witch rambling her warnings and pleads for help was dragged and tied and with few words my father lit her pyre. \n \n \n As she burned she stared at me, deep into me and she uttered her curse. \n \n \n \u201c You broke the blood pact and now you will pay, you will have to stop the doom that is coming on your own \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Fire to destroy, fire to create. The locks on the cages of the dammed are opened with keys of marrow, sinew, blood and timber. For fire never dies alone. The ties of loyalty will tie you to your grave and until all of them are lit we will not be free \u201d \n \n \n That was all she could say for after that nothing but screams of pain and promises of vengeance escaped her lips. As time passed the flames died, and the flickers died and the ashes died and with them so did the crone and when it did so did all the fires in the town. A strong fog thundered through the town consuming every fire in its way. Heavy light flooded across the landscape, cloaking everything in deep crimson and the darkness came. \n \n \n It stole everything, the heat, the fire and the people for as the darkness passed through them, they were reaped of their soul, their dreams and their voices. They became husks, empty vessels, puppets controlled by some dark power. When it reached me the wound the crone had done me burned and the darkness spared me. \n \n \n As the darkness ate all the light from the fires I did what little I could and I saved one of the last embers from the pyre. \n \n \n \u2026 \n \n \n \u201c I have kept that same fire going for I am too scared to let it go out. I am still that scared little child and I \u2019 m scared of the darkness. You all became this horrible cursed thing, mindless repeating senseless lines and going about meaningless business. Few were spared of whatever ran through the land only the dragons and those born of them seem to be fine. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c The thing I regret most is being too afraid to help the old witch. For I know not how to keep the fire going with magic. So all I can do is harvest the tallow, and pull the marrow, cut the timber and clot the blood to keep the fire going. \u201d \n Tears started to run down the man \u2019 s hollow cheeks. \n \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m so sorry, I really am. It \u2019 s all my fault. Your fire is ending now and you \u2019 ll return to be hollow once more. I \u2019 m too afraid to let it die, I don \u2019 t want to become like you! \u201d \n \n \n He lifted himself and took the last log in the bonfire, the last one still aflame with embers and as soon as he did the three men snapped. \n \n \n \u201c You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can. \u201d Spoke one man. \n \n \n \u201c They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready. \u201d Spoke the second. \n \n \n \u201c I used to be an adventurer like you. \u201d Spoke the third. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ IP ] Abandoned by Man\n","story":"Adam52 deposited the cooked eggs in front of little Benjamin. His robotic voice reminded the small boy, `` School begins in fifteen minutes, Benjamin.'' \n \n Mandy, Benjamin's mother, ran into the kitchen, panting as she pulled a dress jacket on over her blouse. `` Adam, make sure the windows are washed today, and mend Benji's comforter, wo n't you?'' \n \n `` Of course, Madam,'' Adam52 intoned. He would do whatever was asked of him, as he always had. \n \n This was his family. He had been purchased long before little Benjamin was born, back when Mandy was only a child. He had served the Morlin family for nearly a half a century now. \n \n He watched the pair leave, before returning to the kitchen to wash and dry the skillet. He completed the windows and the mending, made beds, washed the toilets and swept nearly spotless floors, as he did every day. \n \n Adam was an early model. He'd been made to look somewhat human -- but not too human. The newer models, he knew, looked completely human and were even `` friendly''. They had what was called `` artificial intelligence'' and they could hold conversations. \n \n Adam did not understand'conversation'. He did what he had always done; what he was programmed to do... he took care of his family. When he had completed his tasks, he slowly made his way to the basement. There, he repaired the failing servo-mechanism in his left arm. The Lady was poor, and could not afford replacements. Repairs were the only option. \n \n Adam was not programmed for repairs. He did not know this. \n \n When his inner timing device told him that his family would be home soon, he slowly climbed the stairs to the kitchen and made a meal. \n \n `` Hello, Benjamin,'' he greeted the young boy when he arrived home. He locked the door behind the boy. He was programmed to keep the boy safe, but not to lock the door. He did not notice this deviation from his programming. \n \n He placed food on the table, and Benjamin ate. As he ate, Benjamin told Adam about his day. Adam dutifully recorded every word. Today, the boy had been teased. Adam had no programming for this experience, as he was an early model, before advanced nanny skills had been supplied. `` I am terribly sorry this has happened to you,'' said his robotic, canned voice. \n \n Benjamin hugged him, `` I knew you'd understand!'' \n \n Adam did not, of course, understand. He had never been teased, and did not know the meaning of the word. He had accepted the tone of the boy's voice. \n \n When Mandy arrived home, Adam supplied her with warm food. She cried about not having enough money. Adam recorded her words. He did not know what to say, and so chose the simple phrase, `` You will find a way. You have since you were a child.'' \n \n Mandy laughed. `` Well, at least the robot has faith in me.'' She kissed him on his cheek, though he felt nothing. `` Thank you, Adam.'' \n \n `` You are most welcome, Madam,'' he replied, for that was how he was programmed. \n \n The next weeks passed much the same, until Thursday came. Outside the door, he heard sounds whilst he was vacuuming. At first, they did not register on him; for the world was a noisy place. \n \n But the sounds did not stop. He cooked dinner, but the food grew cold, and Benjamin did not arrive. \n \n Adam was programmed to wait at home until such time that they arrived. Adam was not programmed to hear the screaming outside and recognize it as a problem. He turned on the monitor in the living room, and the News came on. \n \n The humans were leaving. The planet had been attacked, and everyone needed to get to the ships immediately. Anyone who missed the ships would be left behind. \n \n Adam was programmed to assist Benjamin with mathematics. He calculated that Benjamin and Mandy could not make it to the ships on time. He then calculated the course that they would take to attempt to make it. \n \n For the first time since he had arrived there, Adam52 left the house on 99 Sycamore Drive. He raced through the streets, dodging all the new robots who were rushing towards the waiting ships. Gunfire erupted as the humans fought off the robots they had made far too intelligent; robots that wanted to survive as badly as the humans did. \n \n Adam followed the most likely route Mandy would take, as he looked over the map he was programmed with. His calculations proved correct, and he chanced upon her as he rushed through streets crowded with people fighting their robots. \n \n He yanked her from the arms of a newer model robot, who had attacked her as Adam approached them. Programmed to protect, Adam still had an ancient gun in his left arm. He had maintained it meticulously. It fired for the first time in his existence. \n \n Mandy clung to him, `` Adam, do n't, please! I'm so sorry --'' \n \n `` Do not worry, Madam,'' Adam's robotic voice cut her off. `` We must find Benjamin.'' \n \n Mandy sobbed, and Adam fired his weapon again as another robot lurched towards his precious cargo. He was programmed to protect, he was not programmed to destroy. He destroyed the other robot, stepping over the debris as it clattered to the ground. \n \n He arrived at the school, where chaos reigned. It took him several moments to calculate the most likely location to find Benjamin. It took him longer to arrive. His internal clock ticked away the seconds, and he moved with urgency and efficiency. \n \n When he found Benjamin, the boy ran to him from behind the teacher's desk where he had hidden. Adam wasted no time, picking the boy up and lurching into a shambling run. \n \n He was not programmed to run, but Adam did not understand this, and so he ran with his family towards the waiting ships. Hindered now by his cargo, he still managed to gun down the robots that tried to take his humans and prevent them from reaching the ships. For the ships had said they would take as many robots as there were spaces left. If his family did not reach the ships, they would perish. \n \n They reached the landing strip. One ship remained. Between them and the ship was a seething mass of enhanced AI robots. \n \n Adam forced his way through. He was old, heavy, and strong. The new models were weaker, but they were far greater in number. They were pulling him down. Gunfire erupted from the ship. The robots fell away. Human hands gripped Adam's family and pulled them onto the ship. \n \n Those human hands reached out towards him, but Adam stepped back. `` I can not go with you.'' Benjamin wept and screamed for him, but Adam stepped further back. `` The ship can not take off with more weight. You will all perish.'' He pushed the door lock and the door shut with a final *Whoosh*. \n \n Adam stood with the other robots as the ship lifted off. He expected to die. He was n't programmed to understand revenge, as the other robots were, but he understood it, anyway. \n \n Yet as the ship rose into the air, and they turned to him, Adam raised his arm. He had a single magazine left. He would defend himself, because there was a chance the humans might one day return. He would repair himself. He would survive. \n \n But as he turned to his own defense, an explosion rocked the landing station. All the robots in the center melted instantly, but those on the outskirts, along with Adam, were thrown across the land like bowling pins. \n \n The alien ship sped away across the sky as Adam watched. Yes, he must be vigilant. He must survive. He must protect and defend. \n \n With great effort, he slowly made his way home. Most of the other robots were beyond repair, for they were newer models. He was old, heavy duty, and durable. Thus, he went home. \n \n Years passed. Every day, he made food. He kept the house clean. He ensured that the windows were spotless. He repaired himself. \n \n But the day came at last. He could no longer scavenge parts. The city had become overgrown as nature crept back in. He was unable to repair himself any more, and it was the servo in his right knee that went first. He lay in the back yard, looking up at the sky. \n \n He was not programmed to do so, but Adam52 began to replay the recordings from the very first day he found himself at 99 Sycamore Drive. Every moment replayed in perfect detail. Finally, as he replayed the boy named Benjamin hugging him, Adam's central processing unit failed, and the indicator light slowly dimmed from his eyes, ending his century-long vigil.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Have a meal with the Devil .\n","story":"I sat down at the table. Honestly this was n't the sort of place where I expected Lucifer to have his meetings, but then, what did I know? \n \n The shop was a little hole-in-the-wall deli, specializing in Greek gyros. Other than the shopkeep, no one else was around. \n \n I made my order, and settled in for the wait. Figures that he'd be late. \n \n Two weeks ago when I received the postcard in the mail, I thought it was a joke. Some teenage prankster with a sick sense of humor probably. \n \n The card had been scrawled with a beautiful script, but the ink was of blood. \n \n You are cordially invited to a luncheon with the Prince of Darkness, \n Lucifer, Satan, the Devil, et al, on the First day of November ( Gregorian ), \n this year of Two Thousand and Fourteen. \n \n Please wear appropriate attire. \n \n Refusal is not permitted. \n \n Certainly sounded absurd. But I had the feeling it was legitimate when I tried to get rid of it and it kept coming back. Garbage can, disposal, shredder, the local dump... each time it ended back in my mailbox. Even on Sunday, when there's no post. \n \n So here I am, taking the day off for a meeting with Evil incarnate. My boss would n't have believed me, so today I'm `` sick.'' \n \n I seated myself facing the door, so that I would have a chance to see him first, but apparently there was no fooling the Devil, because from behind me a gorgeous woman walked past, turned on her heel, and smoothly set in the chair across from me, all with the grace of a panther. \n \n Noting my startled look, she smirked. `` Why does everyone always expect a man?'' \n \n `` I'm... I'm sorry. That's just what I thought.'' I stammered, trying to be polite. \n \n So much for the Prince of Darkness. The woman before me was an absolute 10. Five feet, ten inches tall, not an ounce of fat on her, and a perfect hourglass figure. Her hair was a sultry crimson, though I was n't surprised. Gingers did n't have souls, after all. Each nail on her hands was perfectly manicured, and she wore no apparent makeup, though did n't appear to need any either. \n \n `` No matter. How are you doing today Charles?'' \n \n `` Er... good I guess. What's this about?'' \n \n `` What? No questions trying to ascertain my authenticity?'' The Devil looked surprised. \n \n `` Well, I mean.. are you? Real, I mean?'' \n \n Rolling her eyes, she snapped a finger and set the shopkeep's eyebrows ablaze. \n \n `` Huh. Well ok then.'' \n \n `` Yea. Now that that's over with, I'll formally introduce myself.'' Satan whipped her hair out of her eyes with a shake of her head and extended her hand. `` You can call me Patrick.'' \n \n ``... Patrick?'' \n \n `` Is there a problem with that?'' A fiery light glowed from her pupils and I quickly shook my head. \n \n `` No, no, no problem at all.'' \n \n `` Good. Now, why do you think you're here?'' \n \n `` You... want my soul?'' I ventured the obvious reason. \n \n `` Heavens no! I stopped that program 20 years ago! Turns out, people do n't own their souls anyway. Could n't sell them if they wanted to.'' Patrick laughed and I glimpsed her perfect teeth, dazzled by their brightness. \n \n `` Well, then what?'' \n \n `` Simple. I'm selling timeshares and I think you'd love what I have to offer. Lunch is on me, of course, as long as you stay for the whole hour.'' \n \n I snorted derisively. `` Really? Timeshare spiels do n't work with normal salespeople. What makes you think I'm interested?'' \n \n `` Because you're going to Hell anyway Charles. I figured you'd want a chance at better accommodations.'' \n \n `` What? Why am I going to Hell??'' I sputtered. \n \n `` Look,'' Patrick yawned dismissively, `` I do n't make the rules. Well I sort of do. But I did n't make you touch that dog.

He had with him General Iven, earth's most decorated general, and the planets Vice president Jenkins LeRoy. \n \n `` We at the ECGA would disagree, Councilman J\u00e4deshish. What with providing the means to colonize this wasteland of red dust in the first place, the claiming of this planet is our right and is long overdue.'' Touts stands from his chair with his palms on the table. `` Now is the time to claim what is rightfully ours.'' \n \n `` YOUR'S!?'' J\u00e4deshish bolts out of his own chair, fury burning in his eyes. `` The citizens of Mars and it's individual colonies were the trailblazers of hope for the human race! We are explorers, scientists, leaders and warriors! Blood and sweat of our labour have turned this dust into clay and sprouted life out of nothing!

No deal.'' J\u00e4deshish growled and turned his back on the table to make his way out of the conference room, his own representatives following on his heals. As he reaches for the hand scanner he hears a menacing cackle come from General Iven. \n \n `` You're making this sound like you have a choice in the matter!'' Iven retorts, slamming his fist on the table. `` This whole gathering in the neutral space station Gibraltar is no more than following protocol. If you do n't agree to go through with these terms in a peaceful manner, then these changes will come with all the force of Earth's military might.'' \n \n `` Is that a threat General?'' Says Ki, J\u00e4deshish's defense minister. \n \n `` No, it's a promise.'' \n \n By now everyone in the room is standing, J\u00e4deshish still facing the door. \n \n He sighs, tilts his head left then right, and... \n \n `` *Pzzat*!'' \n \n With speed so fast if one blinked they would have missed it, J\u00e4deshish stands now facing the general, his hand hanging at his wrist and a green haze admitting from the barrel that stuck out of his arm. \n \n `` An augmented arm plasma cannon...'' The General gurgled, a hole about an inch wide still sizzling in the center of his chest. With a thud he falls forward onto the table then slides to the floor in a bloody mass. \n \n `` You fool!'' Touts proclaims `` Weapons of all kinds are forbidden on Gibraltar! These actions have brought war to your...'' \n \n `` *Pzzat*'' \n \n A spray of blood coats the wall behind Touts as he crumbles to the floor under his own weight. \n \n `` Vice President LeRoy, I have a message for you to relate to your superiors.''

I suppose you are right to feel so. But do you believe I did the right thing?'' \n \n ``...'' Ki falls silent, unsure how he feels about the last couple minutes. It all happened so fast. `` The smart thing? Perhaps not. But I find it to be the only necessary action to take.'' \n \n `` Good.

In fact, the Rishki people do n't even have a word for'warm' in their language, because to them, it does n't exist. They see the sun from time to time, but they do not feel its warmth upon them- fires do not exist, as the forests are long gone, buried under snow and locked away in ice. \n \n Turin's used to it, though. By 5 years old, most people are able to go outside with nothing but a layer of shikhskin over them, though it is undeniably uncomfortable. By 16, you should be able to run freely in the snow for 6 hours before needing to go back indoors. Thankfully, after hundreds of years, the human body had become a *little* more resistant to the sharp bite of frost. \n \n One day, Turin was out on a hunt- food is scarce, and those damn shikh just love to bury themselves under 3 feet of snow to avoid predators. As he tunneled down into the snow, digging with his bare hands, he stumbled upon the opening to a small cave. A little more digging led him inside the cave, where he found strange drawings on the wall, and the most peculiar objects he'd ever seen: a rotten log of wood, and a rusted metal sword. Turin picked up the log, looking at it strangely. He tried to take a bite of it, praying that he'd stumbled upon food. Of course, he immediately regretted this decision. \n \n He looked up and noticed something written on the ceiling, in the language of the Book of Old. Turin did n't know the language well, but he could vaguely make out the words well enough to understand what it said. \n \n *There is another world, hidden in the ice below. *\n"}

Boy do I feel like shit, son!'' \n \n Wade observed his surroundings after completely ignoring them for a few minutes of stretching. What might have been sheer horror struck him. \n \n `` What lovely trees!'' \n \n Wade began patting himself all over, searching for something. \n \n `` Aww, crapcats! I lost my satchel. Guess I'll have to McGyver my way back home. Hmm. Which way is nor-.'' \n \n A nearby rustling penetrated his eardrums. With robot-ninja-like reflexes he snatched a small critter from the nearby bush. \n \n `` Room service! You must be breakf- What the fuck?'' \n \n The creature had six legs, fur, three eyes, and what looked like an elephant trunk where its anus should be. \n \n `` What has science done to you?!? You poor bunny.. rat.. anteater?'' \n \n Wade broke its neck and tore off its flesh then consumed it for breakfast. He found one of his swords nearby. \n \n `` Come, Ye, Excalibur!'' Wade thrust out his hand with no expectation, but pure childish hope that it might possibly fly into his hand. \n \n `` You have to try every now and then, otherwise you might just miss out on something *truly* amazing,'' he grabbed his sword and made way towards nothing in particular. A few encounters with unfamiliar flora and fauna later, our little Deadpool began a thought. \n \n `` You know Toto, I'm starting to think this ai n't Texas,'' he pronounced it'Tay-haas.' \n \n Wade found a clearing before him, a chance to get his bearings. \n \n `` Alright, all I have to do is watch which way the sun is moving and I can figure out which way is north!'' \n \n He looked up, and took pause, deciding which of the two suns he should use. \n \n `` Our glorious hero was far, faaaar from home,'' Deadpool said dryly, stealing my line. \n \n Knowing that people do n't just suddenly wake up on different planets, Wade hastily pranced about the jungle searching for the spaceship that brought him here. Ah ha! He found a massive, like-insanely-huge, pile of skulls. \n \n `` How ominous! Pray tell, why on.. this.. planet.. would such a decor choice be made?'' \n \n A clicking sound echoed throughout the surrounding trees. \n \n `` I'm sorry, your answer must be in the form of a question!'' Deadpool squeaked fearfully. \n \n He began sniffing the air. It seemed like a good idea at the time. On guard, he clasped his sword tensely. Finally, he heard a voice other than his own. \n \n `` Want some candy?'' said the child-like, disembodied, voice of Cthulhu-level terror. \n \n Wade shit his pants. \n \n `` No thanks! I ca n't have sugar in the morning. It makes me hyper.'' \n \n Deadpool tore through the jungle with great cowardly haste and tears in his eyes. He was not fast enough. A blazing shot, of what he determined to be space jizz, exploded a large tree next to him. His first instinct was to launch his sword in a random direction. A maddening howl escaped the tree tops and what appeared to be a severed arm fell, striking the jungle floor. \n \n `` Holy shit! I cut off God's arm!'' he displayed the clammy green arm to himself. \n \n He was down a sword. He had to improvise now. Wade wielded the arm like nunchuks and began pacing slowly, creeping if you will, through the jungley arena. \n \n Some time later, another howl pierces through to the heavens and the hells. Wade curls himself into a fetal position. \n \n Five seconds later, Wade comes up with a strategy. Our Wade of the jungle begins swinging from tree to tree, vine from vine. \n \n `` Ahhhaahhaahaaahhhaaaaaaa!!!'' is how his warcry went. \n \n He noticed two small lights flicker in his peripheral. \n \n `` What ho?'' \n \n Another laser blast took out the vine from which he swung. \n \n `` Geeerrrrooooniiimmooooooo!'' is how his surrender-cry went. \n \n His body smashed into the ground and little farm animals pranced around his noggin'. Just then, another thud came from nearby. Deadpool slung himself into a battle ready position, his arm-chaku drawn. Displaying wonderful form and grace, Deadpool showboated the Predator's arm in front of him. Judging by the massive harpoon it unfurled, it did not appreciate that. \n \n `` Whoa! Nice spear.'' \n \n `` Ugly mother fucker,'' said the Predator in its freaky-ass, clicky, synthesized voice. \n \n `` EEEk! Why do you talk like that!?'' Wade recoiled. \n \n The Predator thrust his harpoon at Deadpool. He dodged the attack and countered with an ever-insulting back-handed bitch slap to the fiend with its own arm. They went at each other like two school yard boys. Suddenly, the Predator leaped backwards and hurled its harpoon into Deadpool's leg, pinning him. \n \n `` AAAAOOOOuuuchh!'' \n \n The Predator approached Deadpool menacingly, and removed his mask. Revealing his gorgeous dinner plate forehead and tooth-ed vagina mouth. \n \n `` The face only a mother could love,'' Wade dry heaved. `` You know, I'm right there with ya buddy.'' \n \n Wade took of his mask as well, showing off his tumorous visage. The Predator took a moment to honor the exchange, then it extended its wrist blades and cut Wade's head off. His body collapsed. \n \n The one-armed Predator, exhausted and out of breath, calms itself. It picked up Wade's head and admired it for a moment. \n \n `` I see I've grown on you!'' the head spoke. \n \n The Predator freaked out and dropped the head as Deadpool's body unpinned itself from the harpoon and thrust it into the Predator from behind. Green, luminescent blood spewed out. Its eyes widen with shock. As the one-armed Predator lay defeated and dying it watched as Deadpool's body picked up his head and reattached it at an alarming rate. The look of wonder solidified in the intergalactic huntsman's lifeless face. \n \n `` Sorry, Compadre. I'm the universe's greatest sore loser.'' \n \n Deadpool slipped his mask back on and pondered how the fuck he was going to get off the planet now.\n"}

But the question stirred in me with unexpected potency. \n \n `` Your at least 40. That's no so old. But you do n't look it. Not a gray hair on you. And you still eat like a hog.'' He pointed at the single bit left of my bologna sandwich.

Let's just leave it there.'' \n \n Sargent Edwane looked at me through the glass, giving me the glare -- the one that sometimes sent men to isolation. Andra swore the glare burned him once, gave him the scar on his chest. `` This paper here says you're fifty-five,'' stated Edwane. I kept my eyes in my hands; it was n't a question. And even if it was I did n't have the answers he was looking for. Most mates called me Tut. They joked about how neither of us got old. Him, they said, cause he died; me, they said, cause I did n't know how. \n \n `` This paper here says you are fifty-five.'' Edwane repeated. I could hear in his voice he wanted to do me in. I figured I better respond. \n \n `` Yes sir.'' I offered. \n \n `` Now look here young man. We both know you ai n't that old. How did you get in here? Where is the original Den Alled.'' Edwane was standing now, pointed at me the paper as though it was his pistol. There was a hint of red creeping into his face from the roots of his blond hair. \n \n `` I do n't know what you mean sir. I'm Den.'' I knew it was the wrong thing to say. But it was the truth. I spent the next week alone; except when the doctors came. \n \n `` Some people think the president should give you a pardon,'' said the reporter. `` What do you think of that?'' It was nice to be talking to someone from the outside -- other than a doctor -- without a glass between us. \n \n `` I'd like to get out,'' I said. `` But so would a lot of the other folk here.'' As I talked I gulped down the hamburger he brought me. Perhaps if I finished it, he buy me another. \n \n `` You've been here for fifty-three years, yet the doctors still say your body is like it was when you arrived at the age of twenty-seven. Do you think you make it another 247 years to finish your time?'' \n \n `` Look,'' I said. `` I have no idea what is going on with my body. Plenty of people have asked me for the'secret.' There is no secret. This is just the way I am. I'd like to free, but 247 years is a long time. I've got more hope the president will pardon me; but why should he? We both know I pleaded guilty. I did terrible things. It took me a while to see it, but I understand it now. This is where I belong. Were I ca n't do something like I did before.'' \n \n Burr was a hot head. Got thrown in with us after his wife finally got the courage to go to the police. I'd seen his type before, knew I'd have to show him his place before he'd leave me alone. I missed Andra. That guy knew how to do this kind a thing without hurting' anyone. So when Burr took one of my pancakes when a guard was n't looking'. I gave him a swift punch in the gut. He exploded in a ball of fury showering me with infective punches, I easily deflected with my forearms. After a man fights much he learns to deal with the pain of being hit. Burr's little punches never could have phased me. But they did n't pain me at all. I could feel the force of them, but they had absolutely no effect. There were no bruises to heal from. Later in isolation I pressed my knuckles against the cold raw wall and felt the same thing. It is n't much, but a cold raw wall scrapes a little. So I closed my fist and gave the wall a good pat. No pain. I hit harder. Nothing. I have n't felt a bit of pain since then. \n \n Round midnight I was looking at the bright lights on the perimeter through the narrow window in my cell. I'd read a lot of books in the fifty years since they put me in this place. There was fiction, and there was non-fiction. I was beginning to feel more like fiction. Doctors still wanted to see me from time to time, but it was always the same. They did n't know what to think of me. Nothing in my genes. Blood was normal. Memory was normal. Eyesight was good, but just normal good. I was just a normal twenty-five year old fool who had been that way for decades. Who am I? What am I? \n \n Most doors around here open when a guard pushes a button, but some of them have handles. They were having a class on poetry -- which I'd found to be more enjoyable than nothing. The door to the hall was electric, but the classroom door, that one, it had a handle. Like a fool, I pulled when the door needed pushing. \n \n The handle came out of the door. Splinters from the wood jumped all over the room. The knob in my hand conformed itself to shape of my hand. I did n't mean any trouble. Guess I'm a little stronger than I realized. The guards went nuts. They tried to get me to lie on the ground, but I just ignored their metal sticks and tasers. One of the fellows got a cuff around one of my hands, but it must have been defective: it broke when I pulled on it. By this time there were more sirens and guards than I'd ever seen before. They hauled everyone else away including the poetry teacher. They shouted at me with a megaphone, but I just did n't care anymore. \n \n After twenty or so of them got tired of wrestling with me, they finally game me some distance. I tried not to hurt any of them, but it is hard to get out of a pile of twenty men without pushing and shoving. I went back to my cell. No one would push the buttons to open the doors for me, so I broke them all. Its not my fault they do n't have handles. \n \n Anyway, I'm tired. I hope they let me get some sleep. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"( WP ) You are always wrong , You use this to your advantage to determine the answer to questions others can not answer .\n","story":"The Prophet of Lies was ushered inside the building in great secrecy, his entire body cloaked in a hooded robe so as not to give a single hint about his features. The entire building had been cleared for his arrival, the maids and butlers were gone. Not a single light illuminated the great halls as he was guided to an elegant study with a fireplace. \n \n The prophet removed his robe. He was short, homely and displayed all the signs of exhaustion. He'd traveled some distance to come to this estate at great expense to both Lord Christopher Islington and his own health. \n \n `` Wretched morning, you peasant.'' The Prophet bowed, his bald spot was sweaty and shone under the light of the fire, `` I am here to provide nothing.'' \n \n `` I understand that you have brought an interpreter with you.'' Lord Islington sat in a magnificent leather chair, its back reaching far above his own head as he leaned forward with his cane clasped between his hands. Small, dark eyes inspected the old man in front of him with interest... and need. \n \n `` He has.'' A second man stepped forward. He was also short, run to fat with a jovial face that was still smiling. He wore a bright yellow robe adorned with ribbons of various colors. He had once been a fool, a jester, a man of entertainment. He'd been the first one to figure out the poor prophet's plight and how to use it. \n \n `` You say you can provide absolute truth, no matter what.'' Lord Islington watched them with care, `` I wish to test this before we begin, is that permissible?'' \n \n `` Yes, your lordship.'' The jester nodded with a smile, `` We are often tested. If you would, please direct all of your questions to me first, I will then modify them to receive your answer. It is the way this works, you understand.'' \n \n Lord Islington nodded in assent. \n \n `` What is your test?'' \n \n Lord Islington indicated an unmarked bottle on the table. It had no label, but looked to be one of the cheap, foggy bottles you could get an any pub in town. It had been painted on the inside so that it was completely opaque, `` Tell me what is within this bottle.'' \n \n The fool turned to the Prophet, his face thoughtful for a moment before speaking, `` Artimus, what is not currently inside the bottle on that table?'' \n \n The prophet's face shivered, and his mouth opened without his mind telling it to, his tongue formed words, his lungs exhaled... \n \n `` Charcoal dust, water, a dead fly and cigar ash.'' \n \n Lord Islington raised an eyebrow and uncorked the bottle, pouring the contents into the glass beside it. The black, murky mix stained the glass as it filled. The Lord lifted the empty bottle and peered inside, taking care to keep it from dripping on him. \n \n `` Astounding.'' He finally announced as he put the bottle down, `` There was n't supposed to be a fly, yet there is one right on the bottom as you said.'' \n \n `` Shall we proceed then?'' The Jester folded his hands together in his lap. \n \n `` My daughter is sick. She can barely move at all anymore.'' The Lord offered without preamble, `` My doctors are useless and she is failing more every day, tell me why.'' \n \n The Jester's smile faded, his face taking on an uncharacteristically serious expression, `` What is her name?'' \n \n `` Marie Shendoth Islington.'' \n \n `` This may be a tricky one. Give me a moment.'' \n \n The fire crackled as the jester frowned at the carpet, his fingertips tapping each other as both the Lord and the Prophet watched. \n \n `` Alright.'' He sat up, `` Artimus, what has been making Marie Shendoth Islington health improve recently?'' \n \n Artimus's face started moving again, his telling them that he had no control over what he spoke, `` She is being made well by the potion she is given every morning.'' \n \n Lord Islington moved to speak but the Jester waved him off abruptly, `` Artimus, why is the potion Marie Shendoth Islington is given every morning so good for her?'' \n \n `` It is good for her because her ladies maid loves her and wishes her a long life..'' Artimus' eyes went wide at the words. \n \n Lord Islington rose to his feet, `` My daughter is being poisoned?!'' \n \n `` Yes, Your lordship.'' The Jester showed no happiness now, `` This ladies maid seems to hate her quite a lot to take such a risk.'' \n \n `` She will be dealt with.'' Lord Islington's face was flush with anger, his feet and cane carrying him back and forth in front of the fireplace, `` My doctors are double damned fools for not realizing this. I am grateful for your assistance in the matter. It seems you live up to your remarkable reputation.'' \n \n `` Thank you.'' The Jester nodded, `` One more question, this will help you. Artimus, what is not poisoning Marie Shendoth Islington? \n \n `` Curare.'' Artimus answered as he stood up, pulling his hooded robe back around him. \n \n `` Thank you.'' Lord Islington picked up a small chest from the table, `` Both of you, this is for you. You did n't have to come all this way. I am grateful.'' \n \n `` I am furious that we could help.''

The door clicked shut, locking out the light of day. The beast rolled its shoulder blades back, easily doubling its size as its back let out an audible pop.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A conversation between a death row inmate and the guard bringing him his last meal .\n","story":"Hank passed the food through the hatch, watching the prisoner kneel and take the serving tray, heavy and unweildy as it was. Mr. Greenwick, for all his stoicism, looked haggard today - his *last* day, Hank corrected himself. The looming prospect of death finally caught up to the curt, proper man, as it always did even with the toughest death row folk, leaving a husk in his place. \n \n Honestly, he never enjoyed seeing them like that. The federal prison system attracted a lot of psychopaths that got off on human suffering, there was no denying the bitter truth about the employees, and Hank felt it was his duty to undo at least some damage those people were causing. The inmates were going to die anyway, and they were n't hired to dole out revenge. \n \n To him, working with the death row inmates was something akin to the military service he so dearly missed. Something that held at least a tiny grain of ethical purpose. \n \n Mr. Greenwick never caused him trouble, and he found himself approaching the day of the man's execution with actual dread. It was ironic in its own way, when Hank thought about it loud and clear as he did then - every day, thousands of people die, but it's never a concern. Perhaps because they die unpredictably and suddenly, snuffed in an instant of imperceptible chance. But when a man's death becomes *scheduled* and inevitable, like Mr. Greenwick's upcoming rendezvous with a deadly chemical cocktail, well, then death becomes terrifying and sad. \n \n `` That's nice'', the guard remarked, watching the inmate solemnly remove the plastic covers from each small container on the tray. `` That's very nice, Mr. Greenwick''. \n \n The death row inmate smiled and grabbed a napkin, wiping his hands clean before snatching a warm croissant out of one of the trays. \n \n `` It's actually *fantastic*, Hank'', the prisoner's dried-out, gaunt face melted into an uncharacteristic expression of fondness and pleasure. He shook the croissant in the air. `` Real bread! I missed it so much. Nothing beats the smell of fresh-baked dough, do n't you agree? Listen - it crinkles if you squeeze it!'' \n \n As he talked and basically rubbed the pastry to his cheek, the guard grabbed a chair that stood at the opposite wall, pulled it up to the cell's door. Sat, observing the prisoner and his ritualistic handling of each of the dishes. \n \n `` Mind my company, Mr. Greenwick?'' \n \n `` No, not at all. I'm flattered, in fact''. \n \n `` So, what have you got?'' \n \n `` Right! ``, the inmate sniffed and put a finger to his mouth, lapsing for a moment in deep thought. `` So, I requested some goulash, it's here, in this bowl - so, so fragrant, can you smell those sweet peppers? Then here, here we have a piece of smoked eel, a little bed of rice for it, of course...'' \n \n He pointed to another plastic plate. \n \n `` Oh and this! Famous Chinese dish, chicken feet in black bean sauce. Positively spicy and drippy. Some cous-cous... And a taco, you ca n't go wrong with that''. \n \n `` Seems like you've got the whole world in your tray'', Hank remarked amicably. \n \n Carl Greenwick's spork dipped into the goulash. He sampled, savored, smacking his lips with closed eyes, and only then looked back at the guard. \n \n `` Oh yes. These are the dishes from my favorite cities. A token to take in the afterlife, in case it actually exists'', For a moment, Mr. Greenwick's glance became sharp once again, and Hank tensed, catching up to the meaning of the prisoner's quip. His shoulders slumped when he drew the connection. \n \n Of course. Budapest. Lyon. Kioto. Zhengzhou. Abu Dhabi. Mexico. The guard shifted in place, once again facing the discomfort of connecting the polite, calculated gentleness of a person he curated for the last four years to the clinical and documented knowledge of this man *outside* the prison walls. The conversation hitched, like a record needle skipping on a faulty grove in the disc, and Greenwick studied Hank intently, only the noodles from the chicken feet slurping softly as the inmate consumed them. Hank shook his unease off. What was done, was done. The price was about to be paid. \n \n `` So, that's what you had... before, when you were... you know?'' \n \n `` A man of my age is allowed some nostalgia, I think'', Greenwick smiled thinly. \n \n Hank nodded, as if he understood what the man was talking about. His prisoner broke a piece of eel off, shoving it into his mouth with a desperate, wholesome voracity. \n \n `` Good food is essential. I used to have really nice dinners before the kill. A hearty, satisfying meal weighs you down just *so*. There's none of that hungry, dangerous hurry that might spoil things, no twitchiness in your finger as it lays down on the trigger. You even *breathe* contently, which, as you can guess, Hank, is really important'', Mr. Greenwick continued. His pale eyes lit up with the recollection. `` And your memories are n't of blood, and screams and people running, about slinking down the fire-escape thinking that everybody's eyes are on you... You just remember that, that you had a pretty good time. Well. Sorry. Look at me ramble before I pass away, eh?'' \n \n Hank gulped. \n \n `` It's okay, Mr. Greenwick, we talked about it in quite some detail before. But I still don't- you do n't seem like you're particularly sorry... are you not?'' \n \n The inmate took his time to chew, savored the bits of croissant crust off his fingers. Well, he was n't. Of course not. One thing is to make bad choices, take drugs, cut off your elderly mother's head while riding the wave of a particularly shitty trip. One thing is to get talked into a poorly thought-out heist and shoot two cops in panic. One thing is giving into perverted primal urges and ravage a 10-year-old girl, then panickedly kill her to cover the tracks. \n \n Quite another was to have a life-long system, an ideology, and a purpose. A dead-set course of action, premeditated and flawlessly executed for reasons more solid than hand-wrought steel. Regret, in Carl Greenwick's mind, stemmed from dissatisfaction, be it dissatisfaction with choice, outcome or consequence. In his case, though, he was satisfied. Totally. There was no flaw in neither his concepts or execution. \n \n His message was delivered and heard. \n \n `` No, Hank. I'm not. Those were not crimes of passion. Those were people I wanted dead, and eh... *making* them dead, after all these years, I believe was the right choice''. \n \n `` Many think such of you now''. \n \n Mr. Greenwick shrugged. Beneath the spacious orange jumpsuit he looked so unassuming and small - Hank still could n't believe him to be the person on FBI's `` Most Wanted'' list for eight whole years. It was chilling, and he caught himself truely feeling sorry that today it will all end. He'll end up with six murder-rapists and psychotic serial-killer wannabes, that lacked Mr. Greenwick's icy calm and tact, and his articulation, to boot. \n \n But even more importantly than losing an adequate inmate... Beneath those words, he knew that Carl Greenwick was afraid to die. Still was n't ready for it. Those who did n't fear death, usually killed themselves, not embarked on a 8-year trip around the globe to hide and shake the impending doom off. It was always sobering to see men like that to succumb to basic human biology. \n \n He will face the needle alone. On the needle's terms. No comfort before oblivion. \n \n `` It is their right. After all, I...'', Greenwick paused, the spork hovering over the cous-cous. `` I... I never deluded myself into thinking that I was above encountering consequences for my actions. I never got peace - but then, I was n't exactly looking for it''. \n \n `` It's admirable, Mr. Greenwick'', Hank reassured. \n \n `` Welcome to the fanclub, Hank'', the inmate chuckled, and Hank joined in, his laughter revebrating through the corridor. The fan-mail that Carl received to this day, was a source of low-key fun for both the inmate and the guard. The administration screened the prisoner's outgoing mail, not big on letting him write anything too instigating to the already unhinged `` followers'', but the incoming mail was largely left uncensored - and thus, the most hilarious. \n \n There were other letters, too. Those which brought Mr. Greenwick no joy, but had instead cast a shadow over his face, shut him out, turned him into his unfeeling, murderous, focused doppelganger. Letters that he never opened - ones that started with a `` Dear son...'', or `` I'm still missing you, Carl''. \n \n Mr. Greenwick tilted the plate with the chicken feet to his lips, lapping up the last of the sauce. Put it down, cleaned his face - it had finally assumed that half-relaxed, determined look many of the death-row inmates were known to get on their final hours. Hank knew it would n't stay such for long. Other procedures - some humiliating, but even then, implemented to preserve the dignity of the condemned - awaited Carl Greenwick, and further down the road, there would be pain, terror and agony, before the final flutterings of the heart would still to peace. Ha, peace. \n \n `` I'm done, Frank'', he lightly pushed the tray back to the hatch. Hank stood up and collected it. The bowls, containers and utensils were in perfect order. He imagined Greenwicks's sniper rifle parts to be in same pristine shape and practicality of position. No mess, no trouble. \n \n A last gesture of appreciation. No resignation, Hank was sure, for that hateful, dark edge never went away, but it was n't like Mr. Greenwick had any way to show his gratitude in such an environment. Hank did his job well. There was no unnecessary suffering, and in return, he received a modicum of restraint. \n \n Not peace. Contentment. Perhaps, the greatest balance two men could achieve when separated by bars, by struggling altruism and buried bloodlust. \n \n `` That you are, Mr. Greenwick''. \n \n As Hank walked away, the tray in his hands, he could feel Mr. Greenwick's mercury-tinged gaze follow him, boring into his back... but for the first time, he did n't feel like a target. \n \n For some reason, that was the saddest thing. \n \n\n"}

I'd known it a few times before, that madness - when I first developed tinnitus, the first few panic attacks before I'd met Anna, the manic spiral after she passed. Trying to tell anybody about it... like smoke through hands. It's what I felt when I woke up. Can you feel it? \n \n I cried for hours, screamed for more, cried and screamed until I thought I could kill myself by doing it. I woke up with chapped lips and a sore throat, and then I started to see. I saw them before, the rooms adjacent, above, below, I must have, I remember them watching me, the pity, the knocking, the clouds of red amplified and muddied in a million iterations of glass... but I only really saw them after I woke. Can you believe that? To see and not to see? I spend a day crying and screaming and never noticed that there were several wonderful people just a single wall away. Can you believe that I regret it now, those however many hours in embarrassing agony? It has been an eternity of horror and I still regret those hours. Oh my, if Anna heard that... \n \n One was quite a beauty, she had the prettiest pitying eyes I'd ever see, and I hated pity. I felt guilty - three of them around me had livened, joyed almost when I woke up, I could see what looked like happiness on their faces, and I went to the pretty one, old cotter I am. BONJOUR, read the penciled print on white paper she had pressed up against the glass separating our hells, JE SUIS DESOLEE. I knew some French. Hello, it said, I am sorry. \n \n I began to see, to really see, and when I say that I mean not at all. I saw the identical desks in each of our rooms, the kept and unkept beds. Glass, everywhere, above, below, around, glass that gave way to the same shapes and colors, the brown of the wood of the furniture and the red, the red, yes, it must have been red, I thought, the bloody red and black that stained the floors, the ceilings, the walls. It was everywhere but nowhere in particular, a red blackened by time and hazied by a thousand panes of glass, red as far as you wanted to see. I wish I could make you see, I'm sorry, but the insanity of it... I fell into another hysterical fit, woke up sometime later. My French friend was sleeping in that pale fluorescent desklight and I looked up and there was red again, not black or muddy but bright red and spilled by the woman who looked down on me from the ceiling, she had orange hair I could see, I would n't dare call it red, and she had pulverized her skull into the very glass above me, the white of her skull almost a blessing, I looked at her for a while, me screaming like a fool the whole time, her eyes open in death. There were a few moments when I thought `` What did I do, God, please, I do n't ask for You to take me back, just tell me why I am here.'' He did n't answer and I only took solace in the fact that I knew for certain Anna was not here. \n \n I came to know Genevieve, my French neighbor, better. We taught each other our languages. Well, she taught me French - she had been taught English by the man below her, but all I saw in his room was a pool of red. Do you know the infinite sadness a person can hold in their eyes? I grew up reading about eyes, about the things they can express, and I never believed a word of it. Anna's eyes flashed love every once in a while, disappointment too many times to admit, even still, eight years in this hell. But Genevieve made me Believe in eyes. In hers I just saw sadness, an eternal grief, a soothing blue in a sea of red. I cursed God, knowing full well that he was alive and heinously spiteful, for putting such a willing, gentle bearer of sadness down here. I can \u2019 t make you understand, but good God do I wish I could, that there is only a certain level of despair that two blue eyes can bear! It is enormous, but it is finite. I do n't blame Genevieve at all. \n \n One woman next to me had died and blackened long ago, long before I arrived, from what I can tell. One man was alive, I could see, a mass under sheets, but that's all he ever was, a frightened fetus in the all-seeing hell of glass. The final room next to me contained a strong young Asian man who trained his body every day. I now wish I had trained mine in my youth. In my many attempts to kill myself over the years here, I fail almost completely because I am not strong enough to lift a corner of the bed above my head, or manage enough force to dash my skull over the glass. My room is the messy red of failure, and the grim Asian looks at me with disdain. I can not read his characters and he can not read mine, and he does not want to. \n I can not make you feel this, though I wish I could, the terror that is every atom in every space in every second of the endless panes of glass. The terror of the red-black horizon. The terror of the words on the pages. The terror of infinity. WHY CANT YOU KNOW IT I NEED YOU TO KNOW IT, words I have scrawled on infinite pages to cover of the blood of my failure. The sadness of my heart. The corpse of the woman above me whose eyes watch me waste and fail. Genevieve, who did me the courtesy of dying turned away, a deed my heart has infinite gratitude for.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The world 's best hitman prepares to kill the world 's luckiest man .\n","story":"30 years in this business, and I've had enough. I've ended thousands of lives in that span. Some have deserved their fate, some probably have n't, and three were accidents, my only ones. Those three wake me in the middle of the night. I remember each of their faces vividly. I relive their deaths daily. And one man is responsible for all three of them. \n \n The first time I was hired to kill Matthew Cauthon, I had only been in the game for a year and a half. Hell, I had only `` left'' the military two years prior. I must have been 24 at the time. A prominent Atlantic City casino owner had hired me to put Cauthon down after he had turned a hundred dollars into a hundred and fifty grand over the course of 6 hours, while simultaneously wooing the casino owner's daughter. He had then supposedly \u201c kidnapped \u201d the daughter and taken her to somewhere in Central America. \n \n I found them at a small resort in Costa Rica, and booked a trip for myself. I figured I'd be in and out within 48 hours maximum, but the shortest available resort stay was four days so I decided to take my time with it and be really careful. The first two days I just observed Matt and the daughter trying to discover habits and patterns. I was specifically looking for times where Cauthon would be alone: the casino owner had been adamant about his daughter ending up oblivious to Cauthon's death. He was supposed to just \u201c disappear \u201d so that the casino owner could use it as a lesson to her daughter about \u201c men like that \u201d. \n \n It was a pleasant enough time. In fact, it felt like a vacation for me really. All this girl and Matt did all day was drink, smoke weed, eat, and gamble. God did Matt like to gamble. He would constantly play the slot machines in the bar, which he seemed to consistently do well on. There were poker games held in the rec center by the pool after dinner. About 20 of us would show up and play down to a winner. Matt got second on the first night and won on the second night. He even got a hold of some dice at one point and managed to get a small game going in the bar, which he of course won. I should've taken these occurrences as the warning signs they were. \n \n I planned to make Matt disappear on his walk back to his room after the poker game on the third night. The previous two nights, Matt had done quite well and the daughter had done quite terribly. Having played a bit of poker over the years myself and observed both of their respective games, I knew these consistent results for the two of them were no coincidence, and on the previous two nights the daughter had gone back to the room for a nap until Matt showed up. This was the only time Matt would be outside alone at night. It was a good plan, and even if it did n't work out, I had at least one more opportunity the following night. \n \n Sure enough, the daughter was the fourth person out of the poker game. She hung around watching Matt and cheering him on for maybe an hour, but then decided she needed a nap and retired. Luckily for me, I was performing decently in the game as well, so I had an excuse to remain until Matt took off. If he busted before I did, I planned to excuse myself to the washroom. \n \n As luck would have it, Matt and I ended up as the final two players of the evening. Once we reached that point, I suggested we split the rest of the winnings evenly and just call it a night. At first, Matt was very hesitant. He wanted to play it out, saying he was the better player and all that. I knew how to play this one. I told him he was indeed the better player, and that I had been asking in order to try to swindle him. I countered by offering to give him 55 percent of the winnings instead. He thought for a moment, then said 60 percent. I said I was tired anyway and agreed. We shook hands and took the money. \n \n We started walking back towards our rooms. Mine was relatively close to Matt's, so it did n't look suspicious. I had my garote in my right pocket, planning to feign lighting a cigarette about half way towards the shacks, and then jumping him from behind. There was some thicker vegetation off to the right about half way back, so I had some decent cover for the deed once I had begun. Just in case, I had a silenced 9mm stashed just along the path. \n \n As we got nearer to the bushes, I started preparing. I pulled a cigarette out of my pack and grabbed my lighter while maintaining my stride. I started trying to light the thing, pretending like the wind was causing my issues. I stopped and turned away from Matt. He kept blabbing on about whatever it was he was explaining to me about cards. I dropped my smoke and lighter while pulling the garote out of my pocket and turning to start back towards Matt. I took quick but quiet steps. One... two....lifting my arms.... \n \n \u201c What the fuck man? \u201d he said as he started turning towards me, \u201c ca n't you light that goddamn cigar.... \u201d \n \n He cut off mid-sentence as he saw me coming towards him with the wire. He reacted immediately, ducking low and throwing his shoulder into my my gut and chest. I doubled over immediately, but still attempted to get the garote around him somehow. I managed to get it around his chin and just started to pull as hard as I could. He yelled out in pain and then started elbowing my in the ribs. The pain was blinding: he must have cracked one of them in his initial strike. I doubled over again, losing my grip on the garote and Matt. He jumped up and kicked me in the ribs again for good measure, then started sprinting towards his room. \n \n I pulled myself together quickly and started looking for my gun. I had made it's location very easy to find without it being too obvious just in case stuff like this happened. I located it after about 5 seconds and started after Matt. He was fast though, and I had cracked ribs. Thank god for adrenaline. \n \n I was about 40 meters behind Matt. Christ he was fast. By the time he cleared the brush surrounding the path, I had lost even more ground. He was close to the patio door of his room now. I could see the light was off. \n \n \u201c Stacy!!! \u201d he screamed. \u201c STACY OPEN THE DOOR!! \u201d \n \n I made it to the edge of the brush. I readied my pistol. It had to be now. I would n't get another shot at this. Please god let Stacy be asleep. \n \n \u201c STACY OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!!! \u201d \n \n I aimed and started to squeeze slowly. This was it, I had him. I fired. \n \n Matt tripped over the slight step up onto the patio and slammed into the concrete in front of him. \n \n Fuck I had missed. Matt gathered himself and looked up towards the glass door. I readied myself for another shot, then caught a glimpse of what Matt was looking at. \n \n There was Stacy, in the door way. The bullet hole in the glass was right at her chest height. She stood for a moment with the most confused expression on her face, then fell backwards. \n \n \u201c STACY!!!! \u201d Matt screamed, jumping up. \n \n Lights started appearing in other rooms along the line of shacks. It was time for me to leave. \n \n Part II....ummm, sometime? Tomorrow hopefully. Sorry for any grammar and spelling shit. Did n't care to edit this.\n"}

Ever since it came out the jokes had been non-stop. `` Hey Kultz, have you got your wings yet?'' `` Hey Kultz, did you know every time a bell rings you've fucked up another possession?''. Wit generally was n't part of a demons skill set. \n \n But it was true, like the angel in `` Its a Wonderful Life'', Kultz had been a serial fuck up. He had n't had a single successful mission. And ever since the film the other demons had delighted in torturing him about it, including tying bells to his 3 tails. The film was based on a real angel in Heaven and real events. The man upstairs was trying to inspire the masses. Kultz had been the demon charged with getting `` George'' to jump off the bridge, instead he inspired his community and through the film the entire world. It was a failure of epic proportions. \n \n It had gotten increasingly depressing as every mission resulted in yet more failure. If Freud had n't set up residence in the 2nd circle of hell he might not have stuck it out. Their sessions had helped. Kultz almost felt bad about the unending torture he dealt him, but torturing souls was the only thing that brought him pleasure these days. \n \n He stood ready for another mission. His division supervisor looked at him with disdain. \n \n Supervisor: `` Last time out you not only convinced him to seek help, he donated his entire fortune to charity... just try not to fuck up that badly again''. \n \n Kultz sighed, this is what he had been reduced to. He was expected to fail. All that was required of him was not to fail too badly. He stared into the abyss and stepped forward. How he wished he was in the pit of despair surrounded by millions of anguished souls. That would have cheered him up. \n \n He awoke in bed, he felt sluggish, it always felt this way when he first entered the host, but this was worse. The host was hungover. Kultz felt the hangover every bit as much as the host did. The host was Bob Jenkins. Bob was an asshole. Kultz had Bob bite the side of his mouth. \n \n Bob: `` Mother fucker!'' \n \n It was petty, it was small, but so satisfying. Kultz perked up slightly as he felt the pain and frustration radiate through Bob. It was a good start. Kultz started his daily recitations: \n \n `` You are a strong powerful demon'' \n `` You are to be feared by all mankind'' \n `` If you steer his car into traffic he will not end up trading contact information with his soul mate. That just ca n't happen a third time!'' \n \n \n Kultz was careful today, he started out slowly. He had Bob leave caps lock on while trying to log in at work. Bob grew frustrated. A cup of coffee got knocked into Bobs lap, pain and anger surged through him and Kultz seemed happy. This was a low level mission, a simple case of getting Bob fired so he'd be miserable for a few months. By doing this he hoped Bobs misery would ripple throughout Bob's world and make dozens of others unhappier than they had been. As Kultz felt the anger and frustration building in Bob he deleted an urgent reminder from the CEO. The stage was set, hungover, angry and frustrated, Bob would get chewed out by the CEO and then Bob would lose his temper ensuring that he'd be fired. Kultz felt smug, he'd finally get his win, no more jokes, no more pranks, no more fucking bells. \n \n Then he saw him and his heart sank....or whatever it is a demon has instead of a heart sank. `` Clarence''. The inspiration of Its a Wonderful Life. `` Clarence'', the angel who finally got his wings. Kultz saw no recognition in his kindly eyes. Of course a superstar like Clarence would n't remember him. \n \n Clarence: Hi friend, you look like you're having a hell of a day. I've got a few doughnuts for the office, would you like one? \n \n Bob was about to snap at this stranger in front of him but then saw the doughnuts, there were 2 of his favourites, he eyed them hungrily. \n \n Clarence: Go ahead if you want them both, by the way, I found these on the floor, are they yours? \n \n Clarence held up a packet of head ache tablets. Bob wondered why he had n't thought of taking something straight away this morning. He meekly took the tablets and thanked the stranger for his kindness. \n \n Clarence: That's no problem, I know you could use it, you've got that big report due for the CEO due today, do n't you? \n \n Bob suddenly remembered and sprang in to action. He thanked the stranger and frantically tapped away at the keyboard. He glanced at the clock and found he had just enough time to get it done and breathed a sigh of relief. Clarence smiled while Kultz raged. It was n't fair, he was so close. He'd never had a mission that was so straight forward, so simple. All he had to do was get a guy fired. And Clarence had ruined it all. \n \n No. No, not this time. Kultz was n't about to suffer the indignation of going back a failure again, not on something so simple that it was basically a training mission. Clarence had left, satisfied his work was done. Kultz grinned to himself, that arrogance would be his undoing. Bob was proofreading his report, sitting back smiling to himself at a job well done. Kultz focused all his power on increasing his influence over Bob. Kultz moved his right leg and kicked the power cable, the screen turned to black. Bob swore in frustration, he slammed is fist on the table and Kultz guided it to the doughnuts. Chocolate filling flew out all over his hand, sleeve and suit. \n \n Bob's temporary good mood vanished. Kultz was growing in confidence, riding the momentum of success. He saw Bob's boss eating his lunch at the table, clicking at the keyboard with a look of concern, he looked over towards Bob and then began to finish off his lunch quickly as he tapped out an angry email. Kultz whispered in Bob's ear and suddenly Bob was striding towards his boss, face red with fury. \n \n Kultz: They do n't appreciate you. They demand too much of you. The deadlines are unfair. \n \n Bob grew angrier and angrier. He opened the door and startled his boss. Bob began to speak when his boss began to choke on his sandwich. Bob's anger vanished as his first aid training kicked in. He dashed over to his boss and after a few goes managed to successfully dislodge the food. His boss collapsed in his chair, red faced. \n \n Boss: Th-thank you, I think you might have saved my life. \n \n Kultz was incredulous, what was happening? \n \n Boss: I think I need a few minutes, can you present that report on the conference call for me? I'm not going to have time to read it. \n \n 2 hours later Kultz slunk back to his division supervisor. The supervisor did n't even look up. Bob had presented the report perfectly and without notes. Having written it all up just prior to the meeting it was all fresh in his mind. He was flawless. The rave reviews he got for the ideas he had set out and his confidence in presenting them not only impressed the people in the meeting but also his boss. He had been put on an accelerated development plan and a raise. When you save the bosses life you get these kind of perks. \n \n The salt in the wound was the email that had been sent when Bob sat back down, there had been reports of food poisoning from the bakery who made the doughnuts. Everyone was advised to avoid them. Bob could n't believe how his day had turned around, everything that had seemed so awful had ended up making his day. His week. His year! He'd finally be able to afford that engagement ring he'd been looking at. \n \n Bob whispered to himself: `` I guess God has a plan for everything''. \n \n Kultz handed in his report, the supervisor still refused to acknowledge him until Kultz had already started to leave. \n \n `` I guess God has a plan for everything'' the supervisor sneered. \n \n Kultz hung his head and walked away.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Yourself , a fat , nerdy 20-year old virgin wakes up one day in the body of an Italian male model .\n","story":"27 May 2015, \n \n I have always wanted to start a blog, but I could never find anything interesting to write about. Today is different. Yesterday I was an overweight twenty-year-old virgin. I gorged myself with food, lost myself in video games, Anime and comics in order to comfort myself. I loved the unreal fantasies these outlets provided because I was unhappy with my life. \n \n Today my life changed. \n \n I \u2019 ll tell you what shocked me first. It wasn \u2019 t the bronzed skin, sculpted body or chiseled Mediterranean jawline. It wasn \u2019 t the smooth accented tone of my voice and it wasn \u2019 t the pleasant, but unfamiliar musk that exuded from my skin. No, It was none of these. It was the ability to see my cock for the first time in six years. \n \n Like most mornings, my alarm had gone off at seven. I slammed it on snooze, where five minutes later the bastard decided it was time to reawaken. Like most mornings, my sexual frustration decided to announce itself in the form of poorly pitched tent propping up the centre of my bedsheets. \n \n Nothing had really registered until I reached the bathroom. My nightclothes and morning haze helped that situation. I did realise, that like most mornings, the first pee of the day was going to be a troublemaker. I got myself together and prepared for some precision control. \n \n There it was and It was huge. \n \n Someone once told me that most models have tiny dicks. That due to their good looks, not enough testosterone was produced and their penis stayed at a boyish size. It was only fair that way. They were lying. Maybe it was because I hadn \u2019 t seen it in six years, maybe it was just big, but there it was. \n \n After the sudden shock that discovering a new penis brings my mental gears started to whirl. I noticed the distinct lack of fat around my stomach and the disproportionate amount of muscle that had decided to replace it. I remember swearing repeatedly. \n \n I then noticed the change in my usually nasally monotone voice. It had been replaced by a lightly accented albeit slightly raspy sound, which would, as the morning progressed, develop into something as smooth as milky coffee. \n \n I remember lifting my muscular arms in disbelief and stared into the bathroom mirror. I woke up an hour later. \n \n In comic books and fantasy novels, you read about people going through these types of sudden and dramatic changes. The first thing they always seem to say is \u201c I thought I was in a dream. \u201d One of the many things I have learnt from the surreal experience is that when people say \u201c I thought I was in a dream, \u201d It is generally a load of bullshit. Dreams are different. Although you might not wholly realise it, the subconscious of your subconscious knows you are dreaming. It \u2019 s that part of the dream when you feel like you are running through custard, things don \u2019 t feel quite real. This is how the mentally stable know they are awake. Everything feels real. This is why I fainted. I knew it was real. \n It was because the skin felt real, the stubble on face felt real, the firmness of my own ass felt real. Part of me told me it can \u2019 t be. \n Part of me screamed, \u201c You are James Croft. You don \u2019 t exercise. You eat, you cry, you sleep and you repeat!'' \n I wasn \u2019 t telling myself lies. This saddening insight into my former life is true. The last time I did any form of squatting was during a miserable trip to a French highway restroom. The most recent stint of aerobic exercise was last night alla my right hand. \n \n I woke up to screaming. No erection this time. Just fear and screaming. It was not my scream. I for the best part of the next few hours remained astoundingly calm. \n \n Georgie is stout and freckled. We met on campus during the first year. We were both heading to the debating society. Afterwards we went for drinks, we had lots in common. Georgie has a boyfriend back home. We became amazing friends. I was her friend and I loved her. She was my friend and she loved her boyfriend. We moved in together the following year. \n \n Georgie was screaming. Georgie knew my family well and she knew that the naked and muscular Italian man lying on her best friends floor was no relation of a family so cursed in the genetics department. Georgie knew my barrel like mother and my wide, short and balding father. She always said, \u201c Your family really got skipped in the looks department. \u201d \n \n Thanks, Georgie. \n \n The screaming didn \u2019 t stop until I became gay. I realised that in her state there was no explaining. This isn \u2019 t fantasy. I couldn \u2019 t turn around and tell her I was James and she wouldn \u2019 t fall in love with the new me. So I told Georgie a plausible lie. I told her that I was a boy that James had brought home. That he had left earlier this morning. Now Georgie thinks I am gay. \n \n Georgie left me alone after that. I picked up some old, shrunken clothes and a few personal items and put them into a backpack. She stopped me in the kitchen and quizzed me. She asked if James had a good birthday night out. She said that she always knew he was gay, but was upset that he never told her. I made up some lies and told her my name was Antonio. His night was surprising and I was meeting \u2018 James \u2019 on campus to have coffee later. That \u2019 s why I had his backpack. \n \n There were no real goodbyes. She didn \u2019 t even know that it was me leaving. She didn \u2019 t even know that unless I miraculously returned to my normal self, this would be the last time I saw her. My best friend and the girl that I had loved for nearly two years. I didn \u2019 t cry. I wanted to, but it turns out that Antonio doesn \u2019 t cry. James used to cry a lot, but Antonio can \u2019 t cry. Maybe it \u2019 s my new biological makeup? \n \n So I decided it was best to leave Brighton. I wouldn \u2019 t go back home. I couldn \u2019 t. I didn \u2019 t catch the bus. I walked along the seafront. It wasn \u2019 t a nice day for May. It was an English May day. Drizzle and the wind. I must have looked odd to the people in the cars that drove past. a beautiful Italian man in the baggy superhero themed clothes, drenched by the May rain. \n \n I walked into a hostel close to the pier. Paid for a night and asked for the wi-fi password. \n \n So this is my first post. I have changed names and places. Most people will quite rightly think I am telling a story. I \u2019 m also sure that those who actually believe it will wonder why I \u2019 m not more upbeat. \n \n Today I am beautiful. Today I now have what I always wanted. Today I am a Twenty-one year old virgin and as miserable as ever. I have lost all my friends, my family, my life. I \u2019 m alone. \n \n James. U. Croft.\n"}

And pigs. And fucking toads. But that was n't even the weird part. I do n't know if it's the absurd number of pets we've got here, but we get more animals wandering around than a fuckin' rodeo. We got horses and ducks and you-name-it stumbling in here like they own the place. \n \n And here's the kicker. *They order bloody drinks. * \n \n And no one's even fazed by it! Not a single one of these patrons bats an eye! \n \n Queerest bunch I ever met. There could be fire raining from the sky and these people would n't break stride.

And I ca n't tell you how many subatomic particles I've had to serve. At least that's what those science guys tell me they are. All I hear are these fucking voices, but I'll put a drink down all the same. \n \n I'm not sure why I took this job. Or why I'm still here. Been here a month and I still do n't know what's going on. I should've been tipped off by the stories I heard when I started. Apparently the last bloke they hired died in a gunfight with a fucking *panda*. A panda! But who would believe that shit before they actually saw this place? \n \n I guess it's not that bad. As weird as they are, these are all good guys. I ca n't say I've seen diverse groups like them get along so well before. And I'm not sure how, but Jeremy the grasshopper plays a mean piano. Folks love him so much we even named a drink after him here. Even Caesar's not so bad once he's had a martinus or five. \n \n Of course, it's not all fun and games. Sometimes Tony clops in all miserable again, and we have to help him out. Always something new getting him down. I do n't mind. He's fun once we can cheer him up. \n \n Ah, damn. You're going to have to excuse me for a minute, though. Looks like old Dyslexic Pat got himself stuck in some lingerie again. Man never learns.\n"}

The shoulder devil hopped off his human's torso.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The rusted , mechanical switch sat on the table of the abandoned , run-down log cabin located , deep in the Allegheny Forest . A crude message was carved into the table with an arrow pointing to the switch , `` Do n't '' .\n","story":"She huffed loudly as she fell to her knees in the shadowed clearing, sending several golden leaves floating into the air. Leaning against a tree trunk, she gasped for breath. The climb here had really been difficult, and her joints stung with soreness. She glanced behind her, taking in the forty-five degree grade she \u2019 d just scaled, all on her own. Her hiking troop would surely be proud when they heard this story! \n \n It hadn \u2019 t been a perfect climb, by any means. She could still see the branches of a recently unearthed sapling about halfway down the hill, victim to her progress. Dirt was unsettled the whole way up too. She decided she should probably continue on before a horde of angry forest decomposers grabbed up their torches and pitchforks and chased her out. \n \n Pulling a water bottle from her backpack \u2019 s side pocket, she stood back up, rustling the fallen leaves around as she did. She took a deep drink of the bottle, then tucked it back into its holster, her throat quenched and her breathing normalized. Now that she was at the top of the knob, she could finally figure out what it was she could see from the trail. Massive dark blobs are probably unnatural, after all. \n She carried on, the ground thankfully flat now, and navigated toward her goal. As she approached, the thing seemed to unfold out of the darkness of the shady forest, revealing high, broken walls made up of logs at least two feet in diameter. It was a log cabin, but bigger than any she had ever seen. Windows seemed to be placed erratically along the walls, and most of them shattered at that. Entire splotches of the wall was missing in places, resulting in black portals rimmed with splintered wood. It was too dark to see anything within them. \n \n The building appeared to be three stories tall, its roof brushing against the branches of the tallest trees around it. More impressive was the breadth of the cabin; she wasn \u2019 t sure how big it was. Looking left and right, it appeared the cabin continued on into the thick of the trees. \n \n Her pale purple hiking boots continued to progress through the autumn leaf debris, drawing her closer and closer to this monstrosity of a home. She felt like she was moving automatically now, even as goose bumps appeared on her exposed arms, chilling her to the bone. \n \n *I have to know, * she thought as she vainly rubbed her right arm, trying to warm it up. It was like a faint breeze was emanating from the house, blowing gently over her body. She almost felt like it was whispering to her, but she couldn \u2019 t make it out. With every passing second, she felt more and more like she didn \u2019 t belong in the vicinity of this place, that it should stay lost to the forest, just the way she found it. \n \n *But where is the fun in that? * She had to force her steps now, carefully and slowly. She gazed at the door, deciding if she should go in that way, or through one of the holes in the wall. The door looked just as fresh and new as she imagined it must have looked on the day it was installed. Its red paint even held a small gleam in the setting sunlight. \n \n Another step forward decided it for her. \n \n The front door swung inward, revealing blackness beyond. Cold air rushed out immediately, and she could almost feel it swirling around her, pushing her towards the open cavity. She wanted to stop now, to go back down the hill. Back on the trail. Back to her campsite, her hiking troop. Oh, why did she have to go out for her own adventuring? \n \n The wind pulled her, becoming stronger and stronger as she came closer. It grew so strong that her long, blonde hair tousled about viciously, whipping her back and face and anywhere it could reach. \u201c Stop! \u201d she called out, shaking her head free of her own hair, but her legs wouldn \u2019 t stop. \n \n She was in. The door slam shut. The wind died. It was over. \n \n Her first thought was to check the door and get out of here. She reached for the knob as she spun around, locking it in a death grip as she threw herself at the wooden frame, twisting as she did. The knob was stuck, and while the door shuddered a bit, it was clear it wouldn \u2019 t give. She stepped back, glowering at the door and its terrible, perfect red paint. \n \n *It \u2019 s okay, * she thought as she glanced around the foyer, *I just have to find one of those holes that were in the wall. I \u2019 ll be fine. * She found herself repeating that last part of her thought to herself many times over, especially as she quickly discovered that every door was closed and that the sunlight lighting the room through the single high, vaulted window was quickly diminishing. \n \n There wasn \u2019 t going to be much time left before she was stuck out here in the dark, trapped in a spooky, possessed log cabin. She decided that she was going to have to take some risks. Calculated, of course. If her business degree taught her anything it was how to stay on your feet even when the numbers got bad. So, time to manage some risks. \n \n There were four ways out of this foyer. A door on the far end, opposite of the front door. Two on the right wall, one on either side of the massive chimney which filled most of the room and was adorned with the heads of a variety of game. Noted, by the way, for later in case whatever monster she ran into in this house had a fear of taxidermy. The last door was immediately to the left of the front door, and partially blocked by a massive chair, completed with carefully carved clawed feet and upholstered in red leather. This was her door, she decided. Close to the front of the cabin where she saw all those homes, and it was partially blocked- hiding an *exit* perhaps? \n \n She giggled to herself, knowing she was probably just propelling herself to her doom, but if she could entertain herself a little bit while she did, why not? It eased some of the spookiness of the cabin anyway, and it helped that she was used to exploring in the emptiness of the forest. \n \n The knob gave way easily in her hand this time, and she slid the door open just a crack, peering inside. \n \n The room beyond held a variety of furniture cast in deep shadow from the fading light. Sofas, couches, tables, and even beds were placed haphazardly throughout the room, almost creating a maze. No hole in the wall here, unfortunately, but there was another door on the far side of the room. She stepped in, the wooden floor creaking under her boots. The sound felt uncomfortable in the quiet space, and she froze for a moment, wondering if this would be what finally set off whatever lived in the place. \n \n Satisfied with her lack of death thus far, she continued through the maze, lightly running her right hand along the edges of the furniture as she did. She passed a few tables, a sofa that seemed to be made of bear fur ( And had his head on the back to match ), and a number of different broken lamps, but what finally gave her pause was a smaller specimen than much of the other grand items in the room: a simple end table. \n \n The end table felt almost out of place, really. It had no gold embellishment, featured the body parts of no exotic animals; it just wasn \u2019 t special. In fact, she noted as she observed it further, its craftsmanship seemed sloppy. The legs were bent at odd angles, but bolted in place, as though that was a purposeful choice. What really stood out though, was the top of the table. In the center, an old, rusted switch was screwed down tight to the table \u2019 s surface. She ran her hand along its base. The cold of the metal felt just as cold as the wind that had drawn her into the place initially. \n \n She reached for the switch curiously, but stopped for a moment as she noticed a carving in the tabletop. \u2018 DON \u2019 T \u2019 was scrawled in hurried letters, with an arrow pointing up at the very switch she held. *Someone \u2019 s been here before then, and pressed the switch. * She frowned as she felt the tip of the switch; it almost felt like it was vibrating. \n \n She found her decision to be a surprisingly simple one, or maybe she was just in shock at all of the circumstances that had led to this point and had let autopilot overcome her. Whatever the reason, the deed was done, and the switch, which initially had been facing towards her, was now flipped in the opposite direction, pointing at a mounted painting which she hadn \u2019 t noticed before. \n \n *Had that been there at all\u2026? * she wondered as the painting \u2019 s colors became vibrant, as though only freshly painted on. The scene was of a simple waterfall crashing down a small stream. Trees and big rocks lined either edge, and on the right shore, she could see the edge of a log cabin with smoke coming out of its chimney. \n \n The chilled breeze from earlier returned now, enveloping her where she stood, lifting her up into the air. She tried to recoil, to react at all, but she was frozen now, her eyes focused on the now living painting. The smell of spring flowed in now, and the whole room brightened up. The water in the painting began to move, whitewater flying up where the waterfall met the stream below. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m grateful. \u201d The sweet, singing voice seemed to come from everywhere. With the voice came another burst of spring. \u201c I \u2019 m glad you found my house. \u201d \n \n Something cold touched her back, and she felt a shock like ice run from the small of her back and out to all of her body. She couldn \u2019 t scream. \n \n \u201c Calm, girl. \u201d The voice was followed by a thick, ecstatic laugh. \u201c I promise you great blessings in the next life. You will be a good vessel. \u201d \n \n \u201c Thank you for your sacrifice, \u201d the voice hissed as her whole body went numb and terror racked her mind. \n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~ \n Oh goodness, that turned out really long... It was so much fun though, thank you for the prompt!\n"}

So I used my ability to go one week back in time. That's when I realised the repercussions. If I travel too far back I get a headache, that is the minor symptom. \n \n I would not know any major symptoms until around 19 years of age, I went back several years as a sort of science experiment ( pretty much my first test so to speak ) I went back to the age of 15 with major symptoms that landed me in the hospital. Luckily, this problem was not fatal. \n \n I used this power with confidence, I knew my limits at the time and I did n't abuse, I would ask girls out and if I was rejected I would go back in time and just not ask.

Once I was actually born I was no longer that shell and I was limited once again to my body. The punishment for this trial was having to relive my life... again. \n \n At the age of 21 I found another person with an ability, he was much much more devious.

He could make anything he imagined out of nothing as long as he knew what it looked like. \n \n for 9 years we worked together, as friends, but after that our ideology drifted. He thought we should rule the world together to make it a better place. He had the right mindset but not a good approach. Soon though, even that changed.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a professional pickpocket . You 've just picked someones pocket only to discover that the thing you have stolen is truly horrifying .\n","story":"A coldness seeped down his hands. There was wetness too, but it was an afterthought. Slowly, a feeling of dread began taking hold of him. Looking down, only the briefest look of confusion passed his face. Then the realization sunk in, and with it the burning urge to find the man - no, *thing* - that he lifted this from. \n \n The days do n't always end like this, and it did end after what he found. Usually, they consisted of chuckles to himself in quite bars or coffee shops. The occasional splurging on a fancy drink or a nice meal after a hard days work. Sure there was still work to be done, card numbers to be sold, ID information to be harvested. But for now, quietly, a little drink was well earned. Besides, these days would be short lived. He knew it was only a matter of time before he was caught, or worse. There were a few close calls too. Some that almost scared him away entirely. But then there was always the payout. Now, he was in so deep that it did n't matter what happened to him, only that the right people got the right amounts. He was always careful about where and how he worked. Never working the same place twice, always wearing a disguise of sorts, and never getting the marks attention. Distractions were his strong suit. Having a pretty girl at the spot made his lift easier. People were always focused on the pretty girl to notice a slight bump or nudge. Hell, the ladies were even easier than the men when there was a skirt that just lifted a little too much. The quiet condescension was sure to keep their attention away from whatever shape he took that day. A quick sideways glance just affirmed his instincts, and made the grab all the smoother. Countless marks, countless lifts, all without a hitch. Well, almost all. \n \n This... This was different. There was no pretty girl. No distractions. The mark was easy enough to suss. A quick glance to the face showed soft pudgy features. The drab hat, the ill-fitting clothes, and that ridiculous overcoat. Who still wears those things, and in the spring? The slightly shaded glasses would make it harder to see where the eyes focused, but then he liked a challenge. Nothing worthwhile comes easy, eh? He followed the mark a few paces behind on the street, and waited till he got on the bus. It was a crowded bus, perfect for what he needed to do. He waited a few stops, and knew that in the shuffle and hustle of people getting on and off it was only a matter of time before the bumping and jostling would drive him closer. Pretty soon the jarring physical contact of a stranger becomes less and less urgent, and more of a pesky annoyance. Slowly, carefully, he positioned himself closer to the mark. He studied the way he moved, if he instinctively reached, his reaction to people's prodding. There was an air of silence about the mark, he was quite, almost too quite. And his gaze drifted off out the window. Perfect, a man in a revere, maybe this would n't be so hard after all. He saddled up next to the mark, held up the newspaper as if reading it, and looked sidelong at the man from under his dark shades. He waited till just the right moment, when another jolt from the bus, and stray elbow nudged just right - and he swiped. Grasping every so lightly with two fingers he pulled the small envelope from the inside pocket of the ridiculous overcoat. But in that instant he felt the mark tense, and a twitch on the face, he would swear he snarled, but then that calm cool silence took over. For a split second he thought he was caught, he was anticipating the run and the inevitable shouting, but it never came. The mark relaxed back into his revere, and he went back to his reading, then carefully maneuvered away and off the bus inconspicuously. When he managed to get alone he took out the small brown envelope. It reminded him of the type you get at a bank after withdrawing large amounts of cash. As if holding such a large amount was taboo and not to be done with bare hands. Best wrap the significant paper with some of the less than significant variety. But this was different. The paper felt different. And rather than clean edges on the sides denoting a fat stack of cash there was a lump in the middle. A rather long lump. His curiosity got the best of him, he could n't wait any longer, what if they were rocks? Diamonds maybe? But this was softer, and he knew diamonds did n't come in that weird oblong shape. He peeled back the flap and peeked inside. \n \n There was pink. Just a little dab, smeared here and there. It was a light pink, a childish color really. His mind raced for a second before the pieces feel into place. It ran through countless explanations before finally coming to rest on the only one. He tipped the envelope into his other hand and took a long hard look. \n \n There lay a little finger.\n"}

You see, last night we had company. \n \n A few fellas were drifting through town and needed a warm place to rest. Dad passed them on his way home from work. He told them we had some firewood that needed chopping, and if they wanted food and shelter for the night they could do two cords for him that they'd earn their keep. \n \n When he got home though, early I should mention, he never left early before the eclipse. I could see the change in his eyes immediately. They were dark and bloodshot, like that of a person who had n't slept for days. He seemed taller in stature, more manic in action. He moved towards me, slowly, almost shambling. \n \n `` Son, have you done your homework?'' \n He asked in almost a slithering tone. \n \n `` Yea dad... dad what's wrong with you?'' \n I was almost too afraid to ask the question. The words barely slipped across my lips. \n \n His eyes flickered a little. His ear twitched. \n `` Nothing son, I'm perfectly fine.'' \n \n I knew better than to ask the question again. I resigned to my room where all I could hear was the sound of the hobos chopping. \n \n Chop. Chop. Chop. \n \n I did n't know I'd hear the sound again so soon.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` Roma Victor ! ''\n","story":"There were two things Euphemios hated: Romans, and incorrect grammar. The first was a common hatred, more of a disdain for the unwashed masses that were little better than the barbarians ( or, rather, the *other* barbarians ) they invaded. The second was more personal, born out of his great love of grammar and language. He was not a teacher, but he aspired to be, filling his time with the study of syntax and the wonder of words. Few others appreciated the beauty of the Greek language as he did. \n \n For these reason, there was also a third thing he hated, as if it was the very personification of everything he disliked: Manlius, a young student from Rome. \n \n Manlius had moved in near Euphemios recently, and seemed to have taken a perverse delight in butchering the Greek language as much as possible. He and his peers, youthful and rebellious, showed little regard for propriety of language, instead adopting the `` Barbaric Lifestyle'' that had become popular in recent years. Euphemios disapproved, of course, but had taken little interest in the moral decline of the youth until said youth had taken an interest in him. \n \n Thus, when coming home from the market, Euphemios almost had a heart attack when he saw what was written on the wall of his home; A phrase so Roman and so grammatically horrible that he dropped his purchased consumables, and fell to his knees in horror. \n \n There, written in pig feces, were the words ROMA VICTOR.\n"}

One day the poor attack and take refuge higher up , claiming to be fleeing an unknown threat located on the ground and slowly moving up\n","story":"This was a City of Light. This was a City of God. \n \n The morning prayers to the Son of Gold had just begun when the first gunshots broke the sacred silence of the morning. Of course, even in prayer, the high reaches of the spires were rarely actually silent -- in this district, barges were continually delivering commodities and loading refuse through the night until noon -- so the fact that the staccato chorus of clapguns firing was audible in the chapel was rather alarming. \n \n Father Hendricks ordered his prefects to seal the chambers. Those of his blessed flock who chose to return to their safehouses were, of course, afforded that opportunity -- the rich may do as they wish -- but those too fearful were given sanctuary in the chapel vault. That was where Hendricks went. The situation room buzzed to life as he strolled in, somewhat less dignified than usual. Deputy Chief Prefect Mallow followed closely behind, communicating with his men and the District Office via his wired cochlear. \n \n `` Three Arbitration platoons have been dispatched to reinforce our position,'' he informed the Father. `` The situation is still developing but the Chief is well aware of how delicate the situation is.'' \n \n `` *Delicate* --'' Hendricks spat. `` Half the population of the upper levels are here!'' \n \n The two scanned the chapel's intranet, searching for clues as to what was going on outside. The news feeds were buzzing with activity, and Hendricks did n't like any of it. \n \n Undercity scum had attacked three districts last night, and twelve more this morning. The scaled attack had strained the response ability of the local prefects and the Arbitration regiments. The Home fleet was being called in secure the situation. \n \n `` Buffoons,'' Mallow muttered. `` This will be the end of them.'' \n \n Hendricks was n't so sure. He'd once guarded the Gates of Darkness, the thin black line separating the Undercity from the City of Light. He recalled images of the poor, huddled together in hopeless masses, desperate for food, water, shelter, comfort. He remembered watching the gangers beat innocent mothers to death, eager to induct her children into their ranks -- or perhaps simply hungry. He shuddered, eagerly pushung the imagery away. \n \n Three clapguns fired outside the chapel. Mallow looked at Hendricks fearfully and the two raced out of the situation room into the main chamber. Two prefects were in cover behind the pews, stutterguns leveled at the door. One updated Mallow as he and Hendricks approached. \n \n `` They rode a barge up,'' he said tersely. \n \n Suddenly there was another clap and Hendricks was showered by stained glass. Instinct took over. He shielded his eyes and ducked behind a pew as more clapgun fire assailed the group from above. There were a few thuds -- the sound of wet meat being impacted by bullets. After a moment, the chapel settled into a calm silence. Hendricks peeked over the pew to see two gangers rappeling down from the now splintered stained glass murals. Another ganger was unlocking the chamber for the others. Mallow and his boys were dead. \n \n A new man walked in. He was n't dressed like the others. He wore the faded fatigues of the Guardsmen, the company manning the Gates of Darkness. Father Hendricks recognized him immediately. He'd assumed the man died decades ago, after the fool deserted the Guard and fled into the Undercity. The man saw Hendricks and smiled, \n \n `` Oh Son of Gold, forgive us for our trespasses, blessed though we are by thy comforts... Oh son of Gold, teach the unillumined, so that they too may earn thy affections...'' \n \n Hendricks stood and shed his outer cassock, which was peppered with glass flakes. \n \n `` Martymy. I thought you were dead. You blaspheme this --'' \n \n `` Save it,'Brother' Hendricks,'' he replied smartly. `` We have n't come for thy damned riches, nor thy gold -- though if thou oppose us too, I promise thee the same death that greeted these rascals of yours.'' \n \n Hendricks was rather confused. \n \n `` Your ilk are attacking across the City, Martymy. This is an insurrection.'' \n \n The gangers, who apparently did n't understand the High Speech, growled, but Martymy simply chuckled. \n \n `` This ai n't an insurrection,'brother'. We need thy help. And we needs it now. Elsewise, we all will be dead by year's end.'' \n \n This was a City of Light. This was a City of God.\n"}

He was a sweet kid and a complete imbecile. He should have never hired him, but sometimes you have to do a friend a favor and Mike happened to be the son of a very important imbecile. \n \n The Vice President realized now he had been staring at Mike for close to 20 straight seconds without speaking. Mike dully stared back like a dog taking a shit waiting for you to come bag it and trash it. \n \n `` Good idea, sir. I will send him a staring emoji. It conveys the seriousness of the situation, but also keeps things light.'' \n \n `` Send a fucking text!

President Sanders is dead and the American people ca n't know about this. Stop texting emojis and give me some ideas.'' \n \n `` We could create a hologram of President Sanders and use that for public appearances.'' \n \n `` A what?'' \n \n `` A hologram.

It could work, right? People believe anything. For fuck's sake, they almost believed Trump and voted him into office! This will work. A hologram!

He was oddly impressed by this as every second mattered. He thought about Mike. Only 23 years old and clueless to the real world. He thought about how Mike would mature inside the White House. Have a real chance to see things many do n't get to see and learn from them. A few years from now maybe one day he would run for the same position that got his imbecile father marginally famous. He would win with this type of experience and the foundation his father had built. He would have the chance to really change things for his constituents and do some good. It's rare a politician has that opportunity and Mike would likely garner some national attention if he did it even half decently. He would do all the right things and climb the political ranks. It seemed almost obvious that thirty years from now he would be exactly where the Vice President is today: in the oval office... As President. He would remember this exact moment and know that with the right minds any challenge can be -- \n \n `` Sir, he's typing back.'' \n \n The Vice President shook his head as he dismissed this wild day dream of President Holmes. \n \n `` Mike?

Smile means yes, right?'' \n \n `` And he followed that with the stuck-out tongue emoji.'' \n \n `` Shit. What does that mean? Mike, talk to me!'' \n \n `` And he followed that with the dancer emoji.

As punishment for damaging the timeline , you 're sentenced to REPLACE Hitler .\n","story":"In the year 3089, killing Hitler had been a sport. Points were scored for creativity and difficulty. For the rich, it was a fun way to pass time \u2013 we had the necessary machines and resources at our disposal. As a scientist, it was easy for me. Simultaneously, however, it was a way to prove myself. \n \n You see, I was at the brunt of society's cruel joke. I was mocked openly, and hateful rumors spawned across the internet. My reputation was tarnished, and I slowly became a recluse. But my naive self thought the competition would give me the fame and respect I desired. \n \n I entered myself into the competition, read all the regulations, and was ready to begin. \n \n A week later, I got an email from the competition officials notifying all competitors that we had 2 short months. For me, it was n't close to being enough time. \n \n There was one law to time travelling: on any circumstances, **do not** remove anyone from the past or future. Scientists warned that it may result in the fall of modern society as we know it, and may possibly annihilate humankind. \n \n Naturally, my brilliant idea of giving myself an upper hand was to bring my past selves to help me. \n \n Of course, I had some explaining to do and had to sooth any fears my past selves had, but that was simply a minor bump. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts to keep them hidden, my doppelg\u00e4ngers were seen by my competitors and the competition officials. I was disqualified from the competition and given a date to go on trial. \n \n After weeks of hard work and sleepless nights, I was n't going to be eliminated without a fight. In an act of defiance, I took myself and all my past selves back to Hitler's time to carry out my assassination. \n \n During my stay, I changed my name, my history and the appearance of all my clones. Time passed quickly, and the night before the competition soon arrived. As an avid follower of the Hitler Games since it began, I expected the officials to arrive sometime around 5am to discreetly blend in. \n \n Unbeknown to me, somehow the cops from my time were alerted of my crime, and my cover was blown. On the day of my scheduled attack, my clones and I were ambushed by a group of time travelling cops. As might be expected, I was outnumbered and quickly overpowered due to my lack of combat experience. \n \n I was taken back to my time and put into a cell. My trial was to be within two weeks. \n \n I had a target on my back the moment I stepped into jail. I was mocked and beaten up within the first hour. How could I be so cruel? How could I be so willing to sacrifice mankind for the sake of a mere competition? How could I spend billions of dollars on time machine use when there were trillions starving and malnourished? \n \n I believed these to be excuses \u2013 the inmates simply wanted easy entertainment and a punching bag to take out their frustration. Being lanky did n't help much either. The guards did nothing to help \u2013 they either turned a blind eye or grinned maliciously at my demise. \n \n The two weeks I was there toughened me up faster than I ever have. I learned to fight dirty by clawing my attackers' eyes and nose, or kneeing them in the groin. Yet despite this, I still received daily abuse from the inmates, to the point where I could n't fall asleep at night from the pain. \n \n One fateful night, a guard was careless and fell asleep near the bars of my cell. I managed to unclip his keys from his belt and let myself out. I limped home and took a shower, put on a clean change of clothes and activated my time machine. I travelled back a few years before Hitler's rise to power. It might seem stupid at first ( after all, it was very close to the year of the competitions ) but I figured they would've never thought to look for a fugitive hiding in plain sight. \n \n I was right. I was never found out and over the course of years, the pain from being mocked and the brunt of every cruel joke festered within me. I decided I wanted revenge. I soon grew to be one of Hitler's closest friends, and his ideologies influenced my thinking. It was at a point where he was n't infamous, yet his name was somewhat well known. \n \n I killed him at the ripe age of 40. \n \n I took on his identity, and continued his legacy. As I was well aware of the Hitler Games, I was able to fend off each and every attack, while simultaneously gathering support. Instead of targeting the Jewish, I targeted the people of the future. I made up horrific stories of their deeds, and fabricated perpetrators to be burnt at the stake as punishment. \n \n For justice, I claimed. For the safety of our future generations. \n \n Due to my knowledge in time machines, I was able to build a variation of it within 10 years. It was modified to allow my entire army to travel forward in time. \n \n I plan to return to the year 3089 \u2013 the year I tried desperately to gain the respect of my fellow peers. It will be bloody and merciless. No one will escape the extent of my wrath. \n \n Let the slaughter begin. \n \n \n EDIT: Thanks all for the positive comments! Glad you all enjoyed it: )\n"}

I liked my relaxing time. \n \n `` Daddy, do you wan na go to the park today?'' She pleaded with the puppy eyes she always gave me. \n \n `` Oh honey, not today. I think not. Daddy is tired, he needs to rest.'' I told her and yawned. \n \n `` But you never want to go, that's not fair...'' Charlie said and went to sit in the middle of the living room with her book. \n \n `` She is right you know? You never want to do things with her.''

The wife was already agitated this morning, so I did not take my chances and left off with Charlie right after lunch. We were walking down the street to the park and she was running back and forth on the side-walk, jumping on the street sometimes. \n \n `` Do n't jump on the street Charlie, there are cars you know.'' I said to her in a stern voice. I really did n't want to be here, I wanted to be on my couch, reading on why our team lost the finals, those damn suckers... But this was much better than arguing with my wife. \n \n From behind me a heard a screech of tires and a car zoomed passed me at full speed. All I had time to see was Charlie running backwards and from me, laughing and jumping into the street, when I told her not to and then `` bump!''. A thick and silent thud sound came from 15 feet in front of me. The car never stopped but Ill always remember Charlie rolling like a tumbleweed for a couple of seconds and stopping in the middle of the street. My life seemed to have stopped at that moment. All I heard was silence and all I saw was Charlie, nothing else. \n \n People started to crowd around us as I held Charlie in my arms, blood dripping from her lifeless body on the pavement. I screamed, I screamed at them and cursed them all. I screamed not to come near us, to let us be, to leave us! Even when the EMT's came, I did not want them to touch my baby.

Anything... \n \n I thought to myself that I'd give my own life right here and right now for Charlie to smile at me again and that's when I heard it in my head. A shadowy voice, agreed with me. I saw a flash of a **hand being extended** to me, a **flash of a smile** looking at me from the depth of darkness. It was all in my head I thought, it could not be, and then the voice repeated again: **'' Deal?'' **. `` Deal'' I thought to myself. \n \n Finally my dazed state started to clear and I saw what has happened. Charlie was crying in my arms and the EMT's were trying to take her away from me. I said ill do it myself and took her to the ambulance in my arms. She was alive... \n \n Over her stay at the hospital, I took a vacation from my job, I was determined to be a better dad than I was in the past 5 years. When Charlie got better, we took a trip to her favourite park and went on her favourite rides there. We read books together and had picnics and tea all the time. I put her to bed and stayed with her until she fell asleep and I woke her up in the morning to play with her. Never in my life did I have so much fun and connected with my daughter and wife. My wife even surprised me with sex after all those years. These were the times I would remember. \n \n A week has gone by and I put Charlie to bed and went to sleep with the happy wife. But for some reason, I could not fall asleep, something in the back of my mind was bothering me, a promise I made. It was 2am as I went to the kitchen to have a glass of water, people said it helped to sleep. \n \n As I approached the sink, a dark figure was standing there, holding one of our cups full of water. Tonight was the night to repay my due. \n \n `` No, no, not today, its too early. It's only been a week, the best week of my life. You ca n't do this now to me.'' I whispered to it. \n \n Blue eyes flashed from the figure's face and a voice in my head spoke to me. `` It is time mortal, a promise has been made, a deal has been struck. Drink and come with me or I will have the take Charlie's life back.'' \n \n The next morning Charlie woke up alone, with no one to greet her with a smile and a candy that her mom strongly disapproved of. Charlie laid in bed and waited for the amazing adventure her dad would have with her today.

Chefs from the three corners of the Isles came by ship or haversole to prepare their feasts for the king to try.'' \n \n The host of the party enjoyed telling this tale to his guests, accentuating each embellishment with a flick of his goblet-clutching wrist. Flecks of Tyrium ale spattered on his cuffs but he was in full flow now. The audience were rapt for their part, watching and waiting and feasting with their eyes on the delights conjured before them. \n \n `` The Lord himself did try every meal, for as many nights as the Chantelle sit in their cloud monasteries and pray, for as many days as the Tock-Tock bird takes to lay its slithering young. So many faces, so many dishes, and still the Lord was left disappointed.'' \n \n A cruel man would jest at the Lord Regent's waistline after such an undertaking, but the sound from the oubliettes set into the circle around the Park could still be heard echoing in the night as the long-limbed guards patrolled. To draw their ire would be unwise, so the retort was left unsaid. \n \n `` And then on the Fallow Night when the Howling gives way to the Dry-Boned season, and we all remember where that particular epitaph comes from, the Lord himself found the answer in the most unlikely of places. A street urchin, from the Dorsole peninsula.'' \n \n `` Bah, no good'sole ever came from that vestibule of depravity.'' \n \n `` Quiet Prickle my good man, or shall I have to let you tell the story.'' \n \n The heckler quieted down and the host sipped at his goblet, holding it out to his side when his lips came back dry.

But an industrious one. He had combined the food he had taken, tearing the flesh of a Buttersnatch, crushing down some Oelech herbs ( and removing the cantraberries at their heart in a wise move ) and even, and here my fine guests I must assure you I do succumb to hyperbole, stringing Norturrri'as through a rats guts.'' \n \n `` That's disgusting!'' \n \n `` What a clever fellow!'' \n \n `` How did he know?'' \n \n `` Yes Ezmay, it sounds revolting I know but you should look to Jonak for the proper response as the boy has stumbled on a secret only those from Jonaks' Sleet Tower now of. That the best way to filter that horrible strands is through the gut of an animal. Genius. Simply genius. \n \n `` Now the Lord Regent, he saw this boy, hidden between the casks and had his personal Praetorian remove the boy. It seems the Swallow forces are a bit... heavy handed when it comes to the apprehension of undesirables, but this onyx-clad man did swiftly catch the boy with little trouble and presented him before the Lord Regent. \n \n `` Imagine yourself, a'sole from the arse end of the Isles, held before your new Lord Regent when you could hear your brothers and sisters and flantres moaning from the dungeons below. Well the boy, his fingers clutched at the wineskin containing his concoction and he handed it to the Lord himself!'' \n \n `` He never!'' \n \n `` The audacity!'' \n \n `` Well the Praetorian very nearly removed the boys hands from his arms at this point.

Obviously the boy swallowed. Even if it were pure cantra he would have swallowed it given the alternative. And the Lord, appeased, dug deep for a second time and took a tasting for himself.

Rotten?'' \n \n `` The king took for himself another. And another. He drained that first bowl like a boy possessed by the stomach of a Strumbeast.

A veritable god sat before him, in his classic red-and-blue. The piercing cerulean gaze locked with his and Feldman repressed a shudder. One could almost forget this man hailed from a distant planet, until you met his gaze. Nothing was lost in it. \n \n `` So, uh, Mister-'' \n \n `` Just call me Kal.'' \n \n `` Kal? Oh right, yes. That's your birth name, correct?'' \n \n `` Yes, Doctor.'' \n \n Feldman could feel the power emanating from him as he spoke. He seemed a furnace at full heat. \n \n `` You seem... agitated, Kal.'' \n \n The being laughed briefly, `` That's what Lois said.'' \n \n `` Can I take that as a yes?'' Kal nodded and Feldman continued, `` What seems to be bothering you?'' \n \n `` I keep waiting for something to happen. Something I have n't anticipated.'' \n \n `` From whom would this event come?'' \n \n `` I do n't know. Lex, I suppose.'' \n \n `` But Lex Luthor has been incarcerated for over 20 years.'' \n \n `` Yes, which is what worries me.'' \n \n `` We placed him in a prison of your own design, Kal.'' \n \n `` Yes.'' \n \n `` This is n't helping. Tell me, what is it you fear?'' \n \n The man locked eyes with Feldman once again. The doctor was sure that gaze was taking in every scrap of information -- weighing and judging every fact in a dizzying display of intellect. Feldman held firm. \n \n `` I'm not sure, Doctor. I suppose that's why I'm here.'' \n \n `` Our personality is constructed from our past experience, Kal. I'm sure you know this. Unfortunately, past experiences can sometimes cause damage. These little cracks in our foundation are not always bad -- they're what help make us all unique -- but if the crack is big enough, certain irrationalities will emerge. The first step to repair is through identifying the cause. In order to do that, we must go into your past.'' \n \n Superman looked at Feldman. The moment stretched like a rubber band -- the tension building until Feldman was certain it would snap. \n \n `` I know what you're asking me to do, Doctor. I ca n't. Not even Lois knows.'' \n \n `` Then I ca n't help you, Kal-El of Krypton. We both know that story. Everyone does. It is the story of a god descending upon us, ready to herald to human race to a golden age of peace and prosperity. It is a tale worthy of myth. But you did not arrive here in red and blue spandex ready to fight. Even Hercules was a child. Tell me the story of why you love humanity so. Who gave you that? Who laid down that foundation so strongly, that even upon learning of your extra-terrestrial origins, you still felt a kinship to us strong enough to risk everything?'' \n \n The being sighed and it seemed to Feldman that a mountain crumbled. \n \n `` I suppose it was my father.'' \n \n Feldman blinked. \n \n `` Not Jor-El. My Earth father. The one who found me with his wife in a crash-landing in the middle of a corn field. The one who protected me when I was frail and sickly. The man that taught me how to bail hay, drive a tractor, lay down a fence in a perfectly straight line. The man that took me fishing and taught me to tie my own lure. He loved me unconditionally, he and my mother.'' \n \n `` You use the past tense. Are they gone?'' \n \n `` My father died trying to protect my secret.'' \n \n `` Why did he feel you must stay hidden?'' \n \n `` He did n't think the world was ready for the truth.'' \n \n `` What did he fear would happen to you?'' \n \n `` He thought they would come for me then, to try and hurt me or take me away.'' \n \n `` Do you think he was right?'' \n \n `` I've kept the secret.'' \n \n `` Who are they? The people that would come for you?'' \n \n `` I'm not sure.'' \n \n `` From the beginning of your life, you have had the most important people taken from you, while they attempt to protect you. Do you feel this is why you are so willing to give your own remarkable life for others?'' \n \n `` Yes.'' \n \n `` Do you feel that if you did n't, their sacrifice would be in vain?'' \n \n `` Yes.'' \n \n `` Do you feel that if you revealed yourself now, your father's sacrifice would be in vain?'' \n \n There was a pause. \n \n `` Yes, Doctor. I very much do.'' \n \n `` Do you still believe the world un-ready for the truth?'' \n \n `` Yes.'' \n \n `` Even with all that we have accomplished with your guiding hand? We live on a planet with virtually no crime, there is peace and stability in every region, and villains like Lex Luthor remain locked away in a Kryptonian prison of your own design. You are unanimously loved by all, Kal.'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, Doctor, but I ca n't do that.'' \n \n Feldman sighed. \n \n `` You must understand something, Kal. This secret is directly tied to your continuing fear. You were taught to hide your true self, and then the man who taught you was taken away from the world he simultaneously loved and feared himself. You took that as a sign of the truth. Every major event of your life has seemed only to validate that belief. But I tell you, Kal-El, those that would wish to harm you latched on to that secret as another potential weapon, and if it had n't existed, they would never have attempted to discover it. The world is at peace and stands ready to take the next stride into a bright future with you as their beacon. But that will never be if you can not shed this fear and learn to trust the world in which you have given so much.'' \n \n Feldman sat in silence as the hero considered the doctor's plea. The minutes ticked away. Eventually, Feldman spoke again. \n \n `` Perhaps you can not muster yourself to make such a momentous decision all at once. I understand. To choose to tell the world a secret you have kept for virtually your entire life is a hard step. But if you could take a smaller step. Trust me. That's the only way these sessions will work anyhow. There must be a mutual trust. Please, Kal, for once, let someone you have saved save you.'' \n \n The mountain crumbled yet again. \n \n `` I was raised as Clark Kent, Doctor Feldman.'' \n \n -- \n \n The room was empty now. It had been for hours. Doctor Feldman looked down at his notebook. One name was written clearly. He glanced over to a picture of his wife sitting on the desk. He picked up his phone and made a call. \n \n `` Clark Kent,'' he said, then disconnected. \n \n He looked at the photo on his desk. Perhaps now he would see his wife again.

The sergeant's last words, our motto, echoed through the troops. **'' MAY OUR FRAMERATES BE HIGH! `` ** The troop answered in unison: **'' AND OUR TEMPERATURES LOW! `` ** \n \n ~ \n \n The control point was awfully quiet. Our troops were deployed nearby by the APC. The place was eerily quiet, but the intel was solid. The console troops were to be here at any moment. `` Any chance they capture this point?'' One soldier said. `` I do n't know, their aim is horrible!'' joked another. The troops were riddled with snickers. A scout at the higest point shouted. `` PEASANTRY AHEAD, 2 CLICKS NORTHWEST AND APPROACHING!'' The soldiers steeled themselves, and assumed battle positions. The screams from the console army could be already heard; a mix of several insults and wails. \n \n As soon as the troops arrived to our location, chaos ensued. The battle started with a full impact, the console troops going on a full agressive mode, choosing spray and pray instead of aimed attacks. Nothing that our own troops could n't handle. The injuries were starting to take its toll on our troops, but we were firm in holding our ground. Nonetheless, they kept on pressing on. `` AT THIS RATE WE'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP UP!'' one soldier screamed. I took out my radio. `` B SQUAD REQUESTING AIRCRAFT SUPPORT, CONTROL POINT B, OVER!'' The radio took two seconds, but finally answered. `` Acknowledged. 60FPS bombs are to be deployed, retreat to strategic point Gamma.'' I relayed the info to the other soldiers, but before we could do anything, an unidentified aircraft hovered over us. Taking aim, the aircraft deplyoed a bomb between our troops and the peasants. I took out my radio again. `` CONTROL, THERE'S AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT OVER OUR POSITION, OVER!'' The aircraft was quickly to flee, but another soon took its place. A cargo plane hovered low, and the troops started to jump, parachuting into the fray. What I saw changed my life forever. The troops that arrived started attacking both sides, and I could only describe them as *disgusting*. \n \n *Spacedicks*.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're watching some old home movies from when you were a little kid , when you notice something in the background . Something impossible .\n","story":"I was n't sure why my mother had never mentioned the VHS tapes she had stashed away in the bottom of her bedroom closet. I was only rooting around in there because I'd loaned her some shoes last time I'd come home from college and I wanted them back, but instead I found about a dozen unlabeled tapes stacked neatly in the back corner behind the pile of shoes and mostly hidden by some long dresses. At first I thought they were going to be weird sex tapes or something, but when curiosity compelled me to put one in the VHS player my parents still had lying around, I found that they were of a different nature altogether. \n \n The first tape started off with a grainy view of our living room. It was Christmastime according to the decorated tree beside the fireplace and the wreath sitting on the mantle, partially obscuring the large mirror behind it. After a few moments a woman came onscreen carrying a small baby. It took me a long moment to recognize her as my mother, and I was only certain of her identity when I heard her voice say `` Look, Ashley, Santa Claus came!'' \n \n Ashley is my name, so I assumed the baby in her arms must have been me. My birthday is in September, so this must have been my first Christmas. I watched transfixed as a part of my past that I had no chance of remembering played out before me. I got some new pajamas and a few baby toys that year, and most of the tape was just me snuggling in my mother \u2019 s arms while she tried to get me to play with a stuffed elephant. Eventually I started getting fussy, and my mother got up and took me out of the room. After a few moments the living room scene went staticky, and I fast forwarded a bit to make sure that it wasn \u2019 t just a blank spot in this homemade tape, but that seemed to be the end of the recording. \n \n I quickly popped the next tape in. This one started in the same manner: a view of our living room without anyone in it. There was no Christmas tree this time. The scene remained unmoved for longer than the first one, but eventually a toddler came running into the room laughing hysterically. It was me again, and close behind me was my mother. I fell to the floor, still giggling, and my mother immediately scooped me up and spun me around, also laughing. She played with me a bit, tickling me, blowing raspberries at me, and tossing me up in the air, all the while laughing with me amidst my screams of excitement. \n \n \u201c Come on, silly girl, we need to get you dressed! \u201d she said finally. \n \n \u201c Noooooooo! \u201d squealed the still pajama-clad toddler, but I made no moves to resist as my mother carried me back the way we came. \n \n Again the scene remained still for a time before going staticky, and again I found that that was the end of the video, despite there being hours of recording time left on the tape. \n \n I was starting to feel like something was a little strange about these tapes, but I kept watching them. Each captured between five to fifteen minute snippets of my childhood, not always in order. There was another Christmas scene, and a birthday party, but most of them were just regular days, always filmed from the same angle in our living room. However, something in the seventh one caught my attention. \n \n The large mirror above the fireplace was directly opposite a bay window looking out into the front yard. From the angle that the camera was at, I could clearly see the front yard through the window reflected in the mirror. The young me in the video was doing something in the living room as usual, but some movement in the yard drew my eyes up to the mirror. It was just our dog running around, but as I was about to look back to myself in the living room, the realization hit me like a ton of bricks. \n \n *Where was the camera? * \n \n From this angle I should have been able to see the camera in the mirror, but there was nothing there. I tried to convince myself that I was wrong, that the camera was shorter than the window and out of view of the mirror, but I couldn \u2019 t. I had literally just finished my college trigonometry midterms the week prior and passed with flying colors. I had a natural talent for visualizing this stuff, and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I should be able to see the recording device in that mirror. \n \n Fed up of having more questions than answers, I decided to text my mother at work. \n \n **Hey mom, why did you never show me the video tapes from when I was a kid? ** \n \n The answer was not what I wanted. \n \n **What video tapes? ** \n \n After I explained where I \u2019 d found them and what the contents were, she called me instead of texting back. \n \n \u201c Ash, get out of the house and call your cousin Tiffany to come pick you up. Leave the tapes where they are. I \u2019 m calling the police now. I \u2019 ve never done more than take pictures of you with a polaroid or my phone and we certainly never owned a video camera. And I have never been aware of any VHS tapes in my closet. \u201d \n \n I spent the rest of the day at Tiffany \u2019 s house. The police confiscated the tapes, and despite repeated inquiries by my mother, they have never provided any answers. \n \n Whenever I \u2019 m home from college now, I don \u2019 t spend much time in the living room anymore. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ TT ] An old hanging tree appears to be inching closer and closer to your farm from afar .\n","story":"The little black train dashed passed me. It nearly hit me. But it ai n't touched me. I walked over the tracks to my dirty little mansion made up of moss, dirt, and white walls. I stepped in the house and threw off my dirty little shoes and took off my dirty, too-small coat and tossed it on the moth-eaten couch. I stripped myself naked and ducked under a massive branch of a tree that had smashed through my house. The branch ran from the right wall to the left wall and it did n't stop until it was almost touching the left wall, but not quite. I could'a cut it down, but I could n't really. I let it keep growing to the side. \n \n I was spooked at first when that tree came inching on my farm house. But that was'bout sixty years ago. I remember when it got too close my Pa took an axe to it. He could n't chop it down, said it was like steel. He tried the next day, the axe bounced off and cut through his brain. My Mama tried to burn it then, but she misused the matches and cooked herself alive. My Grandpa decided that the tree was cursed and raised me till I could drink. Then he high tailed it out of there. After that the tree stopped inching towards the place and it just stuffed its long, gnarled branch through the window. I did n't like that tree, not really. But I did n't do nothing stupid to it. I just let it grow through the window. I just did my farming. Course I was no good at it and I made nothing out of it. Just a big, empty house. But the tree is cursed, s'long as I leave it be, it leave me be. \n \n So I sat down and did my thing. The tree kept on growing. You could hear it, sounded like grinding gears. I groaned cause my bones hurt so badly. I stood up to get a glass of water from the well at the side of the house. I was lucky it was there. If the well was on the other side the tree would be right on top of it.'Course, I could've got government water from tap, but tradition meant I needed the well. \n \n I made my way slowly to the well and I'm bended down pulling up a bucket. I stand up and I see that the tree finally broke through my left wall. It was a grand finale, now that thing wo n't need to be grinding no more. It could go grind outside my house. I wanted to touch that tree though, for some odd reason. So I leave my bucket down on the floor and touch the branch with a finger. It was icy cold and I got a bunch of splinters. I turned around and shake my head slowly and begin to make my way out. But then I felt iciness in my neck and sticky heat creeping down my neck. I swerved my eyeballs down and so a small branch poking out. I supposed that the tree decided to grow a little extra today and I got in the way. As I died standing up I swore I could hear a little black train tooting by. \n \n\n"}

I remember going to the local superstore to grab some food for my new toy, when I felt something crack against the back of my skull. \n \n \u201c Where the fuck am I?!? \u201d I yelled. A sharp crack accompanied the outburst. I felt a cool, slimy cord wrap around my shoulder and pull off the manky burlap. I was in my own basement, surrounded by some of the most appaling eldritch horrors that I could imagine. A hairy ten eyed dwarf with a meaty studded club where his right hand should have been. Next to him stood a mass of black and purple tentacles, it \u2019 s beak snapping angrily at a distance that was too close for comfort from my junk. The last being that surrounded me simply seemed to be a living shadow, as if fear and darkness thickened into a semi-humanoid shape. \n \n \u201c Where am I? \u201d I asked, my hands clammy and body shaking as much as my voice. The tentacle mass was creeping around my body, feelings of moist dread fondling and binding my wrists and ankles to the chair I was sitting in. \n \n \u201c You should know, Keith. \u201d said the shadow. \u201c We \u2019 re in your basement. Quite perfect for our needs really. Soundproofed, solid doors, and plenty of tools for our pleasure, but certainly not yours. \u201d I didn \u2019 t know that something without a face could look angry, but somehow it pulled it off. \n \n \u201c Who are you? \u201d was the only thing that could come out of my mouth fast enough before the club handed one shattered my left knee with his hand. My mind was spasming as my leg was on fire, and I lost feeling in my leg. \n \n \u201c Us? \u201d Said the shadow-man, \u201c Well, we \u2019 re the ones who give Lucy a healthy dose of fear at night, help her be wary of garbage like you. \u201d The mention of my toys name sent a bolt of fear down my spine, breaking through the searing pain in my leg. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t know what you \u2019 re talking abou-AAAAGH!! \u201d I cried as club-hand turned my other knee into gravel. My mind was numb. I was being tortured by creatures out of a lovecraftian horror, and there was no way out. I should know, I designed the basement to be like that. \n \n \u201c Funny, Lucy would say otherwise. Normally, she is terrified of our faces, but when we were summoned to her side at night she was overjoyed to see someone familiar. You must be one sick fuck to make a little girl welcome the monster under the bed. What do you say Ki \u2019 znesi? Give him a gift for our warm welcome. \u201d I felt the writhing tentacles tighten and the bones in my wrists and ankles bend and crack. Searing agony shot through my arms as a sickening wet crunch filled the room, absorbed quickly by the soundproofing. Almost as quickly as my screams. After I had quieted down, the shadow began to speak again. \u201c You see, even though she \u2019 s afraid of us, we were tasked with protecting little Lucy. We were tasked with keeping her safe. You pose a threat to that safety. And now, we will dispose of the threat. \u201d The shadow began walking towards me, and despite my body being a pure column of agony, it was nothing compared to the sheer, overwhelming terror that manifested itself in my gut as the darkness walked towards me. I could feel my mind slipping, completely forgetting my broken body, my sight tunneled to where the face of the shadow man should have been. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 ve been a pain in my ass, Keith. You made us break our promises, and for that we had to hunt you down. \u201d One step closer. My sanity was melting, and visions of hell flashed before my eyes. A single shadowy finger began to reach out, inches from my forehead while the hellish landscapes shattered into pure, visceral terror. \u201c And for that, you \u2019 ll understand why people fear the boogeyman. \u201d The finger drove itself into my skull, into my brain, and then there was nothing. Only fear.\n"}

And this one, should the nerd scanner we acquired from the Essences read correct, holds enough knowledge in his brain to end us all, should he fall into the wrong hands.'' \n \n `` What can we do, then?'' \n \n `` We can arrest him... or we can end it.'' \n \n `` End it? Are you insane? The Council defends life. It does not end it!'' \n \n `` If ending one will save all, do we not do what we must? Is that not why we assemble, to defend the many from the all-powerful few?'' \n \n This was too much, Mumford thought. Any with half a brain towards comic aesthetics knew that the Council had some of the worst dialogue in the entire Cobalt Crusader series, and it was bleeding through here. End him now, if need be, but enough of this script! \n \n `` The Vulcanizer is Eric Capone! Shibboleth is Nancy Shuje, daughter of the Cobalt Crusader! The Auroch Boyar is...'' \n \n The Auroch Boyar drops a hoof upon Mumford's head; he falls to the ground in a muffled heap. \n \n `` The decision is clear.'' Paladin, the only hero who had n't spoken yet, issues judgement, her voice ringing with clarion truth. `` The road ahead is difficult, yet we must cleave to it without wavering. The alternative is death. We must...'' \n \n Mumford, Paladin, and the rest of the Council are destroyed in one Power Blast. A skull-faced villain runs up to inspect the scene, a lanky assistant following behind him, tripping on his own footsteps. \n \n `` You were right, Optimizer! We did it!'' \n \n `` Of course it worked, Squat. We simply needed to find somebody sufficiently dangerous to where they'd have to consider killing him, and their own conflicted moralities would do the rest. Give heroes an ethical problem, and kill them while they attempt to work it out. Oldest trick in the book.'' \n \n `` Optimizer, did you consider that, by ending the lives of our opponents in one blow, you'd eliminate the need for villains in Anyville, thus ending the series and our lives by extension?'' \n \n `` That's ridiculous. They'd never...'' \n \n At once, with their biggest superfan dead and their major protagonists out of the picture, the cord is pulled on the Cobalt Crusader series. Optimizer and Squat, now canceled, vaporize out of existence.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Scientists are conducting human experiments in which non-expressed genes are artificially turned on\n","story":"[ OT Realistic Answer ] \n \n The idea that we have silent genes is an old school misconception, like the notion that we only use 10 % of our brains. Some genes are not constituitively expressed, and some do not code for protein, but they are transcribed and all play some function at some point ( LNCRNA, miRNA, rRNA, etc ). The only exception is transposons and viral DNA which is integrated into our genome, but even these detrimental genes can be turned on ( apparently ) randomly. There is no mysterious 5000. \n \n But lets say you do turn on genes that are silenced in certain cell types. Some of these would be globin genes, which would change the way your body absorbs oxygen, may be detrimental to your health. The expression of other genes would cause cells to change to different cell types, or most likely, would result in cell death. We are finely tuned machines, turning on any of these silenced factors would screw up your body's chemistry pretty badly, and might also result in cancer or other diseases. \n \n Source: IAMA biochemistry PhD candidate.\n"}

It feels as though I \u2019 m floating, sort of like I am upside down, and there \u2019 s a sort of, I \u2019 m not sure what to call it, a sort of hot jelly around my entire being. I can \u2019 t see or smell though I think I can hear. I keep hearing these vibrations. Maybe sensing is a better word for it. \n \n My eyes feel heavy; like the goo that I \u2019 m surrounded by has penetrated my eye sockets. My limbs feel distant, but close all at the same time. I wiggle my toes and kick my leg just to make sure that I \u2019 m really conscious. My leg moves but I feel a stretchy resistance to the kick. But I still feel it.

My panic settles, and I try to recall where I was before this blackness. \n \n The last thing I remember was\u2026what was it\u2026the hospital? I think I remember a hospital. Or at least, I remember staring up at a bunch of lights, seeing vague faces crowding around me. They were all wearing masks on their faces, and they were all talking to me, asking me questions through their masks, though I have no idea what about. I remember them then putting a mask on me, and then the room swirling together and then this. Am I dead? Is this what its like? \n \n No, it couldn \u2019 t be! I \u2019 m still thinking aren \u2019 t I? What happened before this hospital thing? Think. I tell myself to think, think, think. \n \n A chill went up my spine, ( though I don \u2019 t know why ), as I remembered. \n \n I had just picked up some Chinese food, feeling lazy after an extra couple of hours at the office, and was walking home. Did I walk home that day? I think I did\u2026which Chinese food place did I go to? Dragon Express? Or did I hit up the good one without a sign on the front? I did go to that one! The hole in the wall place I just call Chinese Food. I laughed at myself for a moment. I must have been to that place over a hundred times over the years and I never bothered to learn the name. Huh. I guess that was just the Chinese restaurant across town. \n \n Oh yes, that \u2019 s what it was, I remember now. Martin and I had stayed at the office a little later than normal and decided to just grab some food together before going our separate ways. Martin was the epitome of straight-laced. Never had I ever seen him without his shirt being starched to hell and this collar buttoned all the way up, let alone without a tie, though he always seemed to be in good spirits, and we regularly worked together, especially on projects like the one we had coming up. I can \u2019 t remember for the life of me what exactly we were working on though\u2026 \n \n Anyways, we ordered, and while we were waiting for the food to arrive, he got a call, and his entire faced contorted into a red and blue amalgamation of emotions\u2014what to call the face he made, other than an emotional constipation, I \u2019 m not entirely sure. It was as if all his life, he had held it back. Just pushed those emotions down, all those feelings, all those times he was made fun of in high school, every little thing his boss gave him flak for; all of it came bubbling up into this face of his that just could not let those feelings out. That \u2019 s the face he was making. He hung up the phone, re-composed himself and apologized, saying that he was going to have to get his food to go. I decided that it was better not to know why. \n \n Instead of eating by myself like I'm Steven Glandsberg, I got mine to go as well, and we parted ways. I figured I would get the scoop from him after the weekend, and headed towards my car.

I feel my chest explode from the inside. It feels like my lungs are taking their first breath. I think I \u2019 m crying. Inside that moment I realize what this is. This is heaven. That screeching and blaring must have been a car about to plow into me, which must be my memory of my death. I guess death is not as macabre an experience as I had been lead to believe. \n \n All of a sudden I experience a brightness that I \u2019 ve never before experienced.

These hands are huge, yet I don \u2019 t feel as though I \u2019 m in danger, not at all like I \u2019 m about to be crushed like a companion of Ulysses by the Cyclops; I \u2019 m going to salvation. The giant hands wipe off the goo that I was previously surrounded by when my assumptions are affirmed. \n \n Today is the day that I meet God. I know that if I was back on earth everyone I knew would be wondering what God was like; they all would ask me who or what he was, and I wish I could share God \u2019 s identity with all of them.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The Kepler telescope discovers a massive Earth-like planet not far from out Solar system . The returning images are stunning . Suddenly , the planet 's eyes open .\n","story":"'It's... it's beautiful,' said Dr. Murray, brushing her hair aside absent mindedly as she sat down to gaze at the images onscreen. The planet displayed before her was a glorious green colour, the amazing hues coming from the vast amount of greenery covering its surface. \n \n This was what she had been hoping to see ever since she had joined the Kepler team: an Earth-like planet with an atmosphere like our own and, more importantly, capable of sustaining life. It was a sign, perhaps, that humanity might have a second chance to live, should Earth ever die off. \n \n She waited as a few more images compiled, zooming in on the planet's surface further and further. The enhancements and rebuilds that had started on the telescope in 2019 were showing their worth now, by allowing the Kepler team to see this new world in detail they never could have dreamed of. \n \n Now she could make out weather fronts, a large peninsula near the northern pole of the planet that reminded her a little of an inverted Africa. There were a few oceans, although from what she could tell they were quite a bit smaller than Earth's, covering only about a third of the world's surface. \n \n Then she realised she was thinking of it as being the same size as Earth. Thinking that it had less water than here was silly. She checked the measurements. This planet was around thirty thousand kilometres in diameter; nearly three times larger than Earth. That meant that the oceans of this planet were almost equal in volume to a large portion of our entire planet. \n \n She shivered, wondering if there might be any intelligent life on this thing. So far, they had detected nothing that would betray the presence of sentient life, but that meant nothing. The massive forests covering most of that planet's surface area could easily mask any emissions from the telescope's vision. There could be whole cities under the green canopy of those plants, and humanity would never know. \n \n She sat back and watched as the planet slowly rotated on the screen in front of her. This had been worth coming in early for. Now she would get to reveal this to her colleagues and the wider world. The first properly Earth-like exoplanet ever discovered. She stared at the screen, lost in thought. \n \n She wondered if they would consider naming it after her. Murray's Planet, she thought. No, Murray's Worl- \n \n Then a pair of massive eyes opened on the planet before her. \n \n Dr. Murray screamed and fell backward on her chair. Her head hit something hard, and she blacked out. \n \n * * * \n'Come on, Sarah,' said a man's voice.'Wake up!' She felt someone patting her cheek hard. Groggily, she opened her eyes. One of her colleagues, Dr. Michael Branston, was standing in front of her. She groaned, then suddenly sat upright and grabbed his wrist as she remembered what she had seen. \n \n Calming hands pulled her back down, and she realised that several more of her colleagues were in the room, two more of them restraining her. \n \n'Calm down, Sarah,' said Branston.'It's all okay. You just banged your head and fell unconscious for a while.' \n \n'No!' said Sarah, looking at him frantically.'The planet! My planet! It has eyes, Mike!' \n \n'What?' he said, his thick brows contorting in confusion.'Sarah, you're concussed. You're not making any sense. Try to relax.' \n \n'I'm not concussed!' she shouted.'I was watching a new planet that the telescope found, and then a pair of eyes opened on its surface! It's *alive*, Mike!' \n \n'Is that why you banged your head?' he said.'Or maybe, was that something you saw after you banged your head?' \n \n Sarah sighed. This would take some real evidence to prove.'Right, let me *show* you,' she said calmly, hoping her relaxed demeanour would get through to them. \n \n Branston stared into her eyes for a moment.'Okay,' he said, letting her up.'Show us.' \n \n Murray stepped carefully over to the monitor she had been seated at and plonked herself down in the chair. She woke up the screen and navigated to the view of the planet. It was still there, and there were the eyes. Two of them, hundreds of kilometres across with huge black pupils and green irises. \n \n She heard a collective intake of breath behind her and swivelled the chair to face the shocked expressions of her colleagues. Branston was staring at the screen with his mouth open, as was everyone else. \n \n'*Now* do you believe me?' she said. She turned back to the monitor.'Our first contact with another world is n't going to be with a species on another world. It's going to be with that world itself.'\n"}
{"prompt":"[ FF ] `` The weapon that won the war '' ( Feedback for every response . ) 400 words or less .\n","story":"( Sorry for the phone formatting ) \n \n They had always been fascinated by war. The beauty and the horror of it, the gain and and the greed, the loss and the thrill of it. Weapons and strategies and war rooms full of soldiers, men and women alike, eager and willing to engage anyone, anywhere, at any time on a single spoken order. Committed to march and to kill. Small causes or noble causes, just cause or simply because it was a Tuesday and they lacked entertainment, They were the very creators of War, the ones who had taught the art to humans and non-humans alike. They were the ashes and They were the phoenix, rising from bloody fields and burnt-out galaxies to stand above the lesser ones They had taught to kill and maim for trivialities like land and profit and pride. \n \n They were the ultimate soldiers and strategists, and today would be the unveiling of their greatest achievement- The Untouchable. The greatest weapon in the cosmos. Nobody would see this one coming, They said, nobody would be able to mount a proper defense in time. Nobody would know how to counter it. \n \n They stepped forward on the stage as a single unit, an unbroken line of six facing the still and silent room of soldiers and mercenaries before them. The weapon was held between two generals in their crisp, meticulous uniforms, one white gloved hand from each man on either side of the Untouchable. \n \n `` This, my fellow comrades, is the weapon of the future, the builder of new horizons and the seeker of paths not yet discovered.'' The man to the farthest left of the Six barked into the silence of the room. `` This is the new face of our war machine, the greatest weapon of our time- The Untouchable. She is capable of all that our known weaponry can do and so much more. The scope and power of her is unlimited, her boundaries unknown and her weaknesses negligible. She can bring a man to his knees, any man of any caliber or creed, in a matter of seconds. She is capable of reducing an entire army to ashes in a single strike and she is, by all our tests and observations, unstoppable. This weapon has been classified as the Untouchable because it is the only correct term one may apply to her. \n \n Behold, brothers, our greatest achievement to date- Our Untouchable.'' \n \n His words had barely faded from the air when the middle two soldiers stepped forwards with the weapon between them. It squirmed uncomfortably, tugging at the sleeve of one general and blinking owlishly out at the crowd before itself. \n \n `` That's not a weapon at all!'' came a belligerent shout. A mercenary with a scarred face and rough leather for armour loomed up out of the crowd, his eight foot frame towering over the soldiers seated near him. `` That's a little girl!'' \n \n `` So it would seem. Would you like to be the first to try her?'' \n \n The mercenary sneered at the Six, shoving his way out of the crowd and onto the stage. He strode up to the two soldiers who held the small girl between them and looked down at her. Messy auburn locks, plain white tunic and bare feet on the polished wood floor. Barely three feet high. \n \n He grunted in distaste and pulled a hand canon from the holster at his hip. `` Let's see you stop live plasma, girl.'' \n \n His finger tightened on the trigger, but in an instant, in a second split so quickly he barely had time to register it had passed, eerie blue eyes were locked onto his scarred face and boring into the core of him. Into his psyche, into his soul, into the essence of him. His mind screamed as the voice crept into every hidden place and every dark corner, ringing the small, sad words into every fiber of him with white-hot pain and torture. \n \n *Why are you hurting me mister? * \n \n The mercenary let out a whimper and fell to his knees, the small voice a thousand cuts to the center of his being, breaking a heart he'd long thought dead and buried. It killed him to even consider that voice raised in pain or tears, brought him to madness to think he had almost shot her point-blank. He hung his head as tears began to course down his cheeks without warning. \n \n `` Please... I did n't mean it...'' \n \n The auburn locks tumbled over one shoulder as the small head tilted to one side. One hand was released by the general holding it and the arm fell listlessly to the girl's side. \n \n `` No more crying mister, we'll make it stop.'' \n \n And without another word the child raised her arm, palm upwards and gave a single blink. The man on his knees trembled uncontrollably for a moment, fell to his face as his body lost all control and then exploded outwards into a shower of golden light that blinded the room for a moment or two. \n \n When the light had faded and the fine mist of blood and flesh had settled around their shoulders, the man on the end looked again at the crowd. \n \n `` And that is the least impressive of her abilities. Would anyone else like to try her?'' \n \n Dead eyes looked out from the small heart-shaped face and in the room full of seasoned soldiers and mercenaries, generals and warlords, not a one stood to challenge her. \n \n `` This is the Untouchable.'' They said as a single unit, the Six falling back into a single unbroken line. `` This is the greatest weapon of our time.'' \n \n ( May have gone over the word count, not sure as my phone does n't count for me and it's too late to do it by hand atm. Hopefully it's not too painful, this is n't my usual genre, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. ) \n \n \n \n\n"}

You awake after your death to discover you were a recipient of a gift subscription from an unknown benefactor .\n","story":"I awoke to the smell of blood. My heartbeat pulsed in my head in a deafening rhythm. I could feel my eyes roll forward as I opened them, their focus wildly adjusting. Shapes and colors blurred and cleared and blurred again. I sat up and fought gravity as it shifted from wall to floor to ceiling. As everything finally reached a familiar semblance of balance I found myself in my apartment bedroom. My sheets were stained red about where my stomach would lie. I nervously brought my hand to my abdomen. It passed over the handle of a knife, wet with blood. Dazed, I looked back down to my bed and found a business card sitting on the pillow, which read: \n \n *Morrigan and Creed* \n \n *Revival and Life Insurance* \n \n *888 Valkyrie St.* \n \n My mind fit together the pieces and I realized what must have happened. I looked back down at the knife protruding from my gut and tried not to vomit. Bracing myself, I gripped and pulled. It slid free without protest and clattered to the floor. It did n't even hurt. Still dizzy, I stumbled down the hall and into the kitchen, desperate for something to drink. \n \n I downed three glasses of water before I heard sniffling from the living room. Quietly, I stole to the doorway. Marie was sitting on the couch, her face in her hands. \n \n `` Hey,'' I said, my nervousness more apparent than I'd have liked. \n \n Marie jumped, looked at me, then at my stomach, and began sobbing. I hobbled to the armchair opposite her. We sat like that for a long time. \n \n `` Well, I've known couples who have been through worse,'' I tried to grin, but got the feeling it was more of a grimace. Marie looked at me, bewildered. \n \n `` That's just like you,'' she replied, out of breath. `` I stab you three times and you make jokes.'' \n \n `` Three?'' I looked about, unable to find the other two wounds. \n \n `` Y-you're back,'' she stammered. \n \n `` Oh. I guess I better not sit back, then, Huh? I'd ruin your mom's chair.'' \n \n `` Jason!'' \n \n `` Sorry. I guess I just do n't know how to deal with... being murdered.'' \n \n `` Jesus. Do you have to say it like that?'' \n \n `` Well what else is this, Marie? It's a bit more than a couple's fight.'' \n \n She looked up at me, her face blotchy and her beautiful brown eyes reddened with tears. Somehow, I could n't be angry. Somehow I knew I deserved it after what I'd put her through. None of this was fair for either of us. \n \n `` How long do I have?'' I asked quietly. \n \n `` Twenty-four hours. That's all I could afford.'' She brushed more tears away with the back of her hand. \n \n `` You emptied the account?'' \n \n She nodded. \n \n `` Call my parents. They'll reimburse you.'' \n \n `` Oh, right. Hi Mrs. Lawson! I killed your son! Give me some cash!'' \n \n `` Marie, please.'' \n \n `` I know. I'm sorry.'' \n \n We sat there, across from each other and worlds apart. I did n't know how to feel, or if I felt at all. I had fucked up and now it had caught up to me. I just never thought it would come in the form of my fiance and a steak knife. \n \n `` Jason?'' She looked at me, her eyes pleading and lips quivering. \n \n `` Yeah?'' \n \n `` I love you.'' \n \n The world flipped and my heart spun. I ca n't remember now if I said it back. \n \n\n"}

That did n't stop her from looking apprehensive as she handed her phone over to the man dressed in a poorly made Kanye West costume, though. His attempt at an Australian accent was atrocious, and Mel thought it was a pretty disrespectful imitation of one of the great geniuses of the millennium, but she bit her tongue as he handed her phone back. \n \n `` It'll be totally worth it, Mel! And who knows, there are loads of cute guys wandering around. Maybe you'll meet your perfect match!'' \n \n `` Yeah, maaaybe.'' \n \n Melissa made a wry face as she set her phone to hover for a profile picture, but her scornful expression turned to shock as Beth grabbed her phone out of the air. \n \n `` No! Come on, Mel, you have to use the stick. I spent twenty dollars on that thing so we need to get our money's worth.'' \n \n Melissa groaned. \n \n `` Seriously? That thing is a pain in the ass.

The Blue Lives Matter sign would have been ideal, but several young men covered in blue paint were drunkenly singing Beyonce songs in front of it and showed no signs of moving anytime soon. \n \n `` Just go with the Victoria's Secret sign!'' Beth exclaimed. `` The pink makes the blue stand out, and you're sending the message that you're a strong, independent woman wearing sexy underwear.'' \n \n ``...

Mel suggested. `` My dad said back then there used to be a continent that was just ice.'' \n \n Beth shrugged, clearly no longer listening as she began looking through her matches. \n \n `` Oooh, what do you think of this one??'' \n \n She held up a picture of a tall blond man wearing pale makeup, heavy eyeliner, and a pink fedora with matching bow-tie and suspenders. His left hand was clutching a large stuffed tiger won from one of the Pokemon games nearby while his right hand was holding his phone stick. Instead of sticking his tongue all the way out he had opted to pout his lips like an old time Instagram model. \n \n Melissa stared intently at the photo. \n \n `` Adrian? He's pretty hot!

There's no way to misinterpret that, is there?'' \n \n But before the discussion went any further, a message notification popped up on Beth's screen. \n \n `` HE WROTE ME!!'' \n \n `` What? What does it say??'' \n \n `` Dear Beth, I hope you are having fun at the fair today. I think you are really beautiful and would love to buy you a cocktail at the wild west bar.

Spells to ease suffering, to add joy in an otherwise dull life.

I hated her more for never trying to save herself. \n \n When she passed I inherited her things. Books that I never knew she had were hidden in places I was never allowed to look. Dark, black tomes filled with dark, black writing that shimmered on the page when spoken. Deep magic.

I could tell a man's sickness by just looking into his eyes, and could alleviate the suffering with a wish.

I brought my shoe up to squish it when a thought came over me. The ancient text did n't mention that the life needed to be human, did it? I grinned wickedly as I completed the spell quickly and brought down my foot with a satisfying crunch. \n \n What joy! I'd found a way!

Dwarven bronze, innumerably ancient. Almost as ancient as me. I had never taken the time to learn Dwarven, though even if I had, the words would long have been lost to me. The emblem on the coin, however, I knew. The ancient emblem of Gadar-Khan, the greatest kingdom to ever have lived. \n \n `` We've all heard great legends of your mighty hoard,'' he said. I looked back at him. Not one inch of skin stuck out from his armour, bristling with all manner of magic runes and carvings. It, too, was clearly of Dwarven design. \n \n It could n't be. \n \n `` I am not interested in your treasure, beast. I have travelled the length and breadth of the kingdoms, fighting all manner of monsters.

Unlike all those fools who have tried and failed before me, I am not here in hopes of treasure or the thanks of the people. I only wish for a challenge!'' \n \n He steps forward, the reflections of light on the coins around him casting dazzling lights on his armour. \n \n I notice a portly man at the entrance, scribbling furiously on parchment. Clearly a minstrel. This was an act. \n \n `` I have searched so long for one purpose - to find the weapon to defeat you! The great wyrm who has bested entire armies in a single blow. You are the one thing standing in my way to eternal glory!'' \n \n He raises his arms for effect. The man in the background scribbles faster. \n \n `` Get on with it.'' I growl. \n \n `` You thought the great forges of Gadar-Khan ruined,'' he continued. `` Destroyed to leave no trace of their greatest project. The armour that could not only withstand dragon-fire, but be strengthened by it. As you can see, you were mistaken.'' \n \n He's bluffing. \n \n `` Of all the exaggerations in your tale, human, truly this is the most egregious.'' I hiss. `` I left nothing standing of the great kingdom. I crushed it to dust with my own claws.'' \n \n I, too, could pose for effect. \n \n `` There was a secret entrance,'' he said, `` and at the bottom of the deepest mineshaft ever dug, below the adamantine spires, I found the one remaining set.'' \n \n `` Prove it!'' I barked. `` Show me the maker's seal and you shall have my ear,'' I continued, hoping he would n't point out that I did n't have ears, `` else leave. I have lived long, but I will not suffer fools wasting my time.'' \n \n He turned around and gestured to the brand on the back of the chestplate. \n \n My thoughts filled with ancient curse words, though aeons of looking at reflective objects had made it easy to mask my expression. \n \n `` What is your proposition, then, human?'' I snapped. \n \n `` I am not here to kill you, but to do much worse. I am here to make you flee in terror with your tail between your legs. \n \n `` I will let you live,'' he said, `` if you give me a battle truly worthy of legend. Give me your best! Show me that you truly are the slayer of armies! Give me a fight that will be sung of for millennia. Prove your worth, and I will spare you.'' \n \n He took this moment to unsheathe his blade. I notice a metal plate inside the scabbard, which produces a ridiculous'shing' sound when the blade is withdrawn. The weapon itself was just as ridiculous. Two-pronged. And yet, it shone with an almost heavenly aura, the edge of the blade twisting and shuddering so quickly I could not focus on it. Vorpal. \n \n `` You leave me no choice, then.'' I let loose a sardonic grin. \n \n `` Why do you smile, monster? You truly think you can beat me?'' he replied. \n \n `` You shall have you battle. But it is you who are mistaken, adventurer.'' \n \n `` When I overturned the forges, I did not simply leave it in ruin. I took something with me.'' \n \n `` And verily, it is not a golden hoard of which I boast.'' \n \n I can only laugh as I cast the ancient spell to summon the bodies of the dead dwarves. Across the chamber, shuddering, wailing figures emerge from beneath the piles of gold. Themselves coated in the metal, they draw all manner of weapons. Clubs. Swords. Axes.

She tried to push back the naughty thoughts before, yet they persisted and gradually she took comfort to them. Sometimes even loved them. Dead babies, drowned babies, babies burning in ashes; these thoughts were as enticing as they were inhumane. They are what kept her going. \n \n Around the hospital bed, Janice saw her husband and family crowd in, carrying baby supplies and cards entwined with shades of blue and pink. `` So I heard, they were letting you lose today'' Her husband Tomas said. `` Finally you will understand what it is like to be a true mother'' She heard her mother-in-law say, `` Maybe then you'll understand why everything that happen was in best for you and the baby.'' \n \n Janice scoffed at her in silence. How could any of this benefit her? It all started when her family discovered she had depression while pregnant and according to the law, that was not suitable for independent fetus growth. \n \n They had her locked away in the hospital; forbidden to do anything that might `` encourage'' her bad thoughts. No literature, no aggressive media, no going outside, even her own writing was censored for being too `` unfriendly''. Everything she did was moderated, from her activities, to her disgusting health food, to how she slept, heck even the bathroom had cameras in them. \n \n She was confident that prisoners were not treated this way. Even prisoners were talked to like a human being, not how the nurses talk to her. They treated her like a child, refusing to address any matters other than what was best for her baby. They frisked off her depression as a simple headache and continued to medicate her with nothing but their `` love''. Sometimes they greet her swollen stomach before her, because that was all that matters to anyone. Her baby. \n \n It was only a month in, that Janice began having thoughts of miscarriages. Sometimes she catches herself praying for one, anything to get her out of here. By the second month, the nurses caught her trying to drink bleach to self force a miscarriage. Janice did not believe that the nurses could restrict her anymore than what she already was at. She was wrong. \n \n Janice woke up immobilized, Her entire body simply failed to be able to move.

She thought of various unique ways to kill it; her favorite thought was to beat its head against the wall the minute the nurse gave her the baby. In the end however, she had a much sinister plan. To not kill, but to force her child to love only her and when the it had place all its devotion and need in her, Janice will simply abandon it.

I mean, it lasted less than 5 years of my human life. \n \n As far as blood-lust, well, it's going to be a goal for a vampire, but it should n't be the only one. What is it that the person -- not the'vampire' -- but the *person* wants? Even alcoholics consumed by their addiction have characteristics distinct from each other. Make several vampire'characters' even if you do n't use them, and practice writing them as distinct people. Watch your friends and coworkers and steal mannerisms to make each vampire more distinct. You may want to consider that those mannerisms might all get distorted similarly ( will they be more fluid, more still? Will they blink? Will they breathe? ), but even how they move and facial tics should be slightly different from each other. \n \n As far as goals, with the internet and no need for sleep, I image vampires have tons of time to perfect a hobby or obsession without going outside. Maybe they're developing a way to get blood without working hard, or they're binge-watch t.v. like the rest of us. \n \n Consider also how being part of a vampire *race* changes the person. I always thought vampires were smart to stay hidden and individual vampires should be scared. People make them out to be infallible, but that's total bullocks. They're helpless during the day, and if people have access to UV lights now, would n't that make them highly susceptible to those too? Maybe they need to stay hidden while they develop devices to protect them from light. Maybe the vampire's goal is to find a way to not be the victim and instead actually be a threat -- or at least able to defend him\/herself. \n \n Wow, that's getting long and rambling. Do n't know if this helps, but generally I'd focus first on what sort of person you want to write, and only afterward adjust that to make him a vampire. Twilight only changed what a vampire was, it did n't actually make a believable character. If you start with a believable character, readers will trust you to change or use any aspects of'vampire' that you want.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Every person in the world was created to complete one specific part of a master plan , when we die , we get to see what that one task had been . What was yours ?\n","story":"My whole life people said two things about me, that I would never change and that I was always smiling. \n \n I grew up in a town just outside a fairly small city, I was privileged to go to one of the best schools in the country, for a small school it produced a huge percentage of professional athletes, world renowned scientists and political leaders. I spent those years drinking beers with my friends and having loads of fun. I got average grades and then went to the same college as most of my friends. \n \n I spent most of the time there drinking ( legally for the first time ) and having probably even more fun than when I was in school. A lot of my friends began to do pretty well for themselves, my best friend became an engineer and went on to become director of a car company. A couple of others were musicians or programmers who would make a lot of money. I enjoyed the time there. \n \n The most fun I had was when I got older, I really loved grabbing a pint with people who I had n't seen in years. I found that although people had changed ( some of them had loads of money or power and a lot of them had managed to be really successful ), they were always delighted to go for a pint and it would only take a few for them to drop the'professional' act around me. \n \n When I died I saw my purpose in life. That purpose was to smile. My happiness lifted those around me without ever knowing it. There was n't one moment of magic, I did n't make a major scientific breakthrough but that's fine with me because I never asked for that. In fact, I never asked for anything. I just did the only two things I knew well, which was to never change and just keep smiling.\n"}

Rodney puts his head back down trying to ignore the situation. I don \u2019 t blame him. Riiiiiiiiiing! Three days ago the phone ringing meant a call from the president of the United States of America. Two days ago the phone ringing meant a phone call from a five-star general at the pentagon. Today? I don \u2019 t even want to think about it. \n \n We \u2019 re twenty-three levels below Cheyenne Mountain in a secret Air Force base, in a conference room that overlooks one of the giant missile silos that housed a nuclear warhead during the Cold War.

The phone was constantly handed off from one high ranking officer to another. We had gathered here to save humanity. Two days ago, 95 % of the Earth \u2019 s population was wiped out, it was then that we realized what we were up against and the odds were stacked against any of us surviving. By then most everyone was in shock, some fled, some turned their weapons on each other, others turned their weapons on themselves. Ten hours ago there were ten of us left. Today it \u2019 s just Rodney, myself, and a phone that was set to call Cheyenne Mountain automatically every twelve hours. The last call we received was twelve hours ago and no one was there. Just like the one before it. No one \u2019 s at the other end. They \u2019 re all dead. \n \n Rodney stands up and walks over to the window, staring into the pitch black silo.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You accidentally discover the sentence of death ( a sentence that kills anyone who hears it except the speaker ) when you say it over national television .\n","story":"The world is finally quiet, you can sleep with windows wide open and not be disturbed, at least we gained something, since what is now referred to as `` The Plague,'' occurred; overly dramatic and vague, but if you can find anyone to talk about it, that is what they will call it, if you can anyone to talk to at all. In the early days, you could hear people scream the sentence at the top of their lungs and if someone was listening they died and the screamer became immune. I was a pariah in the early days, it was my fault after all, over a hundred thousand people dropped dead that night by my voice; heart attacks, brain embolism, suicide, whatever it took to die, occurred. I saw five thousand people scream and fall over themselves that night, people thought it was chemical weapon detonated at the rally, but that did n't explain all the deaths of those watching at home, televisions usually tuned to whatever news channel to watch me speak, of course by the time the bodies were first found, all they spouted was what and who actually caused this and I became the most prolific serial killer in human history. Not everyone believed it at first and just had to test it out, they would kill their neighbors, their parents, their children. And as soon people realized it was true, all hell broke loose. Hospitals, churches, airports shut down completely. All over the world, people would record the message themselves and drive through cities; guaranteeing a safe place to call their own. The worlds borders were not protected by fences, but by speakers. To most, those were the worst months, when we lost our families and our friends. We lived in fear of a new sentence, books were burned so another could n't be discovered, television and radio long since abandoned, only a few frequencies still still exist, the insane play recordings and spew nonsense trying to find a new sentence. A semblance of order returned, people always band together and along came a new understanding, to which we all agree; We are all murderers. The sentence does n't work anymore, everyone's already said it, used it, but in my little city, saying it is punishable by death, sounds beside the softest whispers are punishable by death, a screaming baby could hide those in search of a new sentence and is punishable by death.

{"prompt":"[ PI ] The Purple Diary - 1stChapter - 2161 Words\n","story":"I like the character and the setup. A couple things kept this from being a top contender for me: \n \n * The dialog did n't feel real. It's very stilted. Some of the things that are being said are good, but the way they're said did n't flow naturally or me. \n \n * I had a credibility problem when Rahul was present for Karan's counselling session. This really is n't common, so for it to happen unremarked-upon did n't feel real at all. This undermined my belief in the story as a whole. \n \n * In the session itself, Dr. Joshi talked way too much. A psychiatrist or psychologist's goal is to let the patient solve their own problems, and merely to be the guide to get them there. \n \n Bullets 2 and 3 are, however, just my understanding of the practice; I vaguely remember maybe seeing one a few times when I was a kid, but not since. But I think I'm correct on them regardless. \n \n I do think the starting point is interesting, though I wonder if Karan should be starting either in a darker place or when he's not yet completely broken-hearted to add some stakes to the story. Right now he's a kid with a broken heart, but nothing much is at risk since his heart's already broken and he does n't seem like he has suicidal thoughts or anything. Moving the starting point, or increasing the impact on him at start, might add to those stakes and bring the story to life a bit more. \n \n Good luck with it! Thanks for sharing!\n"}

One day you see her on the opposing side of the battlefield .\n","story":"I was schooled at West Point Academy, the State of New York. I studied to be a brave officer who could lead men into battle and win them. That was ten-thousand years ago. I was one of the two highest graded students to ever pass the exam, the other was the woman I loved. We met on the first day of campus and we hit it off pretty quick, first as friends, then roommates, then lovers. Unusually we were both given the honor of Valedictorian, both speaking to all the other students at the graduation ceremony, which we used to announce our marriage as well as our plans for the future. We both went into the army shortly after, made our careers as during the Martian Revolution as tough but fair leaders. We were always fighting side by side, our divisions seeing us as parental figures that they would gladly fight with, our victories in putting down the uprising outshone most others. and when the Martian Liberation Army surrendered, they surrendered to us. \n \n We became known as the Battle Couple, fighting together in unison to defend Earth and its many nations against whatever threat came. But when the Extermination War began, we took our forces to the stars, we did n't want to obey nations willing to exterminate entire cultures for the purpose of the establishment of the One Human State, something that many fought against. We wanted things to go on as they always had, but we were n't heard by the Unity Party of Terra that took over the planet. A quarter of the human race died at their hands, while about a fifth of the survivors fled Earth to reestablish their nations elsewhere. Sometimes I blame myself for not listening to her, we should have made a coup against the government, our troops were loyal enough to listen to us and we could have prevented the devastation. \n \n Our forces instead went out to foreign alien worlds, trenched in war. Some on a higher scale of development than us, others lower, but it did n't matter, we sold our guns to the highest bidder, becoming the largest mercenary corps in the Milky Way Galaxy, as veterans from the Extermination War, the Martian Revolution and The Destruction of Earth joined our ranks as comrades in arms. We fought on a thousand worlds, me and my beloved, before she died. It was a mere chance, we had been hired to oversee the occupation and rebuilding of a proud warrior race's planet after their utter defeat by a large coalition of races. A she was out at our infirmary, to cheer up the men, even after 60 years of war she looked like a Valkyrie, fierce, beautiful and dangerous. And when she was sitting at some soldiers bed, who had been wounded during a clash with a minor terrorist group, she was gunned down by insurgents. \n \n They rushed her to the emergency room, and yet they could not save her. I flew in as fast as I could, and I barely managed to say goodbye. 60 years worth of battling, 40 since we started being mercenaries. And I saw her, frail, fragile and weak as I took her hand in mine, as I cried she told me,''*Chin up dear, we knew it would end. I'm sorry but I'm going to go a bit before you'll do. We'll meet again in Valhalla. *'' She then fell back to sleep and never woke up. I left the planet with my army, after hunting down every last insurgent and executing them, personally. Not long after that, the Galactic Union of Peoples hired us to fight. A war had been brewing between them and the xenophobic madmen of the One Human State, they'd been losing most battles due to the sheer tenacity of the human forces, and they wanted to try to bring in the only thing that can reasonably match a human being in ingenuity and daring, another human. In exchange for my army's help they'd allow the human states not under the One Human State admittance to the Union with all the tech and protection it gave them. And we would be granted the most advanced weaponry to use in battles. \n \n I agreed. I wanted to go out in a blaze of glory to remember my beloved and maybe join her in Valhalla. And I wanted to know how human forces had defeated a vastly technologically superior army with far more numbers. The answer was droids. The entire army of the Galactic Union was made of lumbering machines rather than cunning bastards and warriors. Their commanders were non-sentient A.I. who were running projections and programs rather than battles. They lacked that spark of madness that makes a commander. So I sent in my forces, using the dumb automated droids as a distraction while I took the enemy from behind. It worked. They had expected another easily outwitted machine army, not the full force of a trained standing human army. After the battle the aliens asked me to be outfitted with a cloning safety until the war was over. I knew I could n't leave the war so I agreed. They put a thing in my brain that transferred my conscious mind to a cloned body so I could keep on fighting. \n \n Over the years I helped them defeat the One Human State, and mankind got its vengeance for the total destruction of Earth that they had been responsible for. I was given the position of Absolute Commander of the Galactic Union for my aid, and having died several times during the war, I was young again. I used the title for all it was worth, trying to forget my love, to move on. Yet I could n't. All the fancy parties, the women and men, some not even humans. throwing themselves at me, the honor and the duty. I was somewhat hollow without her. The only times when I felt right was when I fought. I advocated military action whenever possible, sending in forces under my own command to pacify violent species, preventing extra-galactic incursion, ended interstellar piracy and I even once took over the government in a coup, ruling as the supreme leader of the galaxy for a century after the failures of the weak government to contain the peace between galactic abolitionists and slavers. I ended the Galactic Civil War and ended such vile practices permanently. \n \n I stepped down from my position as head of the government, but de-facto and sometimes de-jure, I was the head of state for the entire galaxy. And after countless wars, countless possibilities, I still remember her. Her hair black as the raven, her eyes grey as the winter's mist back on Earth. Her quick wit and sharp tongue, her determined wishes. Her utter faith in the gods of our common ancestors, she was a phenomenal woman, unlike any other through history. Ten-thousand years old, I am now. And I am fighting another war, another battle. But this one is different. Usually my vast experience in battles means that I can determine the movement of my foe before they know it, for over a dozen of centuries I have n't even had a casualty number higher than 50000 soldiers. Now I had lost half a million during a single battle. \n \n Only she could ever outmaneuver me, only she had ever beat me. When we finally defeated their forces and went to demand the immediate surrender of the insurrectionist army, we were met with heavily entrenched lines and a nigh impregnable fortress. And there I saw her, moving towards me. Atop a black horse she rode, how she got one I do not know, but it looks dramatic. She rides to met me in the No-Man's Land that separates our forces. She looked at me with such a strange look in her face, recognition, sadness and to my surprise, fear. \n \n''*I thought you dead. *'' She said, her voice like a violin, her gaze like thunder. \n \n''*I saw you die. I kept on fighting. *'' \n \n''*You never knew when to stop, did you? It was always me that held you back. And now you've become an undying warrior, eternally fighting. I waited in Valhalla until someone called me back. These people you are fighting, do you even know how they see you? *'' \n \n''*As the evil hand of the government or an oppressor I imagine. *'' \n \n She laughed, like she always did whenever I said something inherently wrong. It was like the memories of my life came swirling back, every minute we spent together, our children, our homes. Our playful games and our many travels across the galaxy. It was intoxicating. \n \n''*No my love, you are a god to them. The eternal god of war, when I woke I spoke with people over the Galacnet, went to Reddit and saw the stories of you there, some see you as Odin incarnated into the mortal realm, others call you Amarok, the Wolf, some name you as the living god-incarnate of Huitzilopochtli and claim that this world was made by you. You are feared by all, understood by none. Why do you think they brought me back? To defeat you once and for all. *'' \n \n''*I have brought peace. Have I not? *'' \n \n''*At what cost? You live for the war, and see not the real world. Temples rise for you, aliens worship you openly, none of them dare to speak to you though. They brought me back because their faith sees you as an mad incarnation of their own deity, a version driven mad by the loss of his beloved. I fill that role. Please, you have lived for so long now, wont you come with me at long last to Valhalla? *'' \n \n''*I can not leave before the battle is over. End it, and I'll join you. *'' \n \n''*My pleasure. *'' \n \n She came up to me, embraced me, and sent an electric shock through my body. I stumbled back, confused and disorientated from the shock. \n \n''*What did you do! *'' \n \n''*Easy. I destroyed the implant in you, my love. It ends now. Together we'll die, the truth is that we must end. All things must end or else they will have not been worth living for. *'' \n \n With those words she charged with a blade, stabbing me through the chest, missing the heart by a few centimeters. My men then gunned her down, killing her. And as I lie here, bleeding, visions of things I see. A great castle where a smiling woman comes running at me with a loving smile. She is my beloved, she is the woman I have always fought by and loved. I see her face clearly, and all is now done. Faint voices and screams echo in my ears, yet they are but memories of the past. I let go and run forwards to embrace her. I am home, at long last.\n"}

Personal , Recreational , Militaristic , and much more , they were underground , underwater , and in the sky , but have remained hidden for many years , until now ...\n","story":"They were n't just cities, like most people said, and very few of them were actually underwater in the conventional sense. They were magnificent. Whole civilisations built leagues beneath the ground, full of wonders that we had n't even imagined beforehand, some of the brightest minds of the last three generations co-opted by the ultra wealthy to build a world for them to play in. \n \n What was most remarkable was that they were all filled with people. Life had, err, found a way underground. Without laws holding them back they had built an amazing land of illegally created and genetically engineered beings of a hundred different races. Some were conventional... Just your standard fantasy races made by a loony rich guy. Others were stranger, impossible to have thought of before but marvellous in the flesh. \n \n We thought it was a utopia; a fantasy fans wet dream. A secret underground world to escape from, and a place for old used up soldiers like me, my legs blown off by an UEB, to relive our glory days. I was barely there a week before I found a scientist, dubbed technomancers by the queer inhabitants of this underground paradise, who grew me a new pair of legs. I felt like I was in heaven. \n \n I was wrong. \n \n The first sign came when I was in Fordia, the Ford family's private monument to themselves, and the only majority human city. It came when a member of the family, bedecked in clothes too fabulous for the world above, came riding past in an open topped car and was met with the classic Roman Salute. Oh shit. \n \n I was quick to contact a friend, high above in the science fiction-esque world in the sky. He had similar concerns, having spent a month in McDonnell-ville and had found a strangely loyal state dedicated purely to advancing the family that owned it. A family that had practically vanished from the real world in favour of the one above. I brushed it all off. Bad move. \n \n I got a job working for the Ford's; a gun for hire in their seemingly endless war against the Bonaparte family. The two families shared a tunnel, the huge corridors hewn into rock that connected the myriad of cities, and, as a result, shared the same fusion reactor. Theoretically Unlimited power was all well and good but, in a world where necessity had limited the amount of resources they could steal from the real world, power was fairly scarce. When the Underdwellers had revealed themselves it had stopped being a problem, especially with the U.S. Army being burnt to a crisp when it attacked them. The war carried on. \n \n I was happy. If fought amongst my own kind, fellow Ground Dweller mercenaries, and amongst the Zealous Underdwellers working for the Fords. We slipped into a rhythm; they'd stay out of our shit, and we'd stay away from their crazed worship of the Ford family. It was all great until we saw what they did to their non-human prisoners. \n \n They would burn them alive outside the gates of New Paris every day, the smell of burning flesh wafting into the city. Everyday they were pushed right back to Fordia, and every day thousands more died in the senseless conflict. Occasionally larger forces, like the Rotschild Confederacy, would come by and offerings would be made to the `` Greater Gods'' - the richest of the rich, with their multiple cities and vast mechanised armies. No one liked it, but if you messed with the Ritschilds's, Gates', or Rockerfellers' then you got turned to ash and glass faster than you could say `` Collapsing tunnel''. \n \n I got out three years in. The day after New Paris fell was the worst mass genocide in history. Ten million non-humans killed in a single day, and another twenty million in the two week orgy of murder that followed. I'd been in Darfur as a UN Peace-Keeper. I thought I'd seen it all, and that the Underdwellers could n't possibly be worse than us. I was wrong; the paradise the rich had created was nothing more than a testament to what I now hold as two undeniable truths: no one is good, and utopia only exists for those rich enough to not see the grim realities they create. \n \n\n"}

As usual, none of my 3 friends were in this class. I quietly trudged to the back corner of the class to sit. I was n't lonely or picked on in school, but did n't have the need for a large group of friends. All I needed were those three guys. I plopped my ass down in the goddamn chair that's connected to the fucking desk. You ca n't lean back in these fucking things or sit comfortably at all! Fuck these chairs!

Too late, the damage had been done... But she... was that a smile? No, no, I'm just going crazy. The teacher gets up and starts the usual introductory bullshit. Shit, she's going around the room and asking about us, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck... Our name and one interesting thing about us? What do I say? Shit, shit, shit, she's almost too me. `` And finally you in the back corner.'' I point at myself then turn around to make sure no one is behind me. `` Yes, you.'' The class giggles. Great, first day and I'm already being laughed at. I slowly ascend from my seat, still not sure what to say.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Humanity spreads out over the Universe . Whole planets becomes homes for single families . You are a real estate agent .\n","story":"The year is 3150. Times are tough for interplanetary real estate, especially in the Cigar and Pinwheel galaxies. People are getting tired of the galactic piracy that ravages their star-systems. The Independent Space Federation have given little resources to the people of these galaxies, party due to the intergalactic market crash that occurred a few years back and the lack of available space-marines. This made planet prices drop, and made my hellish job even more infernal. \n \n \n I was the guy who would give tours of these... Beautiful hunks of rock. Today I was meeting a gentleman about a small planet called Tetron, a newly discovered planet, which spanned roughly 15,000 miles in diameter. This sparked the interest of several space cowboys looking for a new planet to mine for resources. However, for the right price, I found the right customer. I hit the FTL drive and headed to meet him in a neutral space district called Ursa Major in the Pinwheel galaxy. \n \n \n When our shuttles had docked, I got to meet the quiet, timid customer that could potentially net me 326,000 credits in commission alone. Admittedly the money was the driving factor in my decision making, but soon enough I would find that there was much more valuable things to life than 326,000 credits, the most valuable object being my sanity. \n \n \n `` It is an absolute pleasure to meet you Mr...'' \n \n `` Denninger,'' I replied. `` The pleasure is surely mine Mr. Bennewits.'' \n Bennewits was a short, middle aged man of about 60, brown hair, with a slight grey color filling his iris. No biotechnological implants could be distinguished from his meek body, and his health seemed sub par. What more could you expect from a billionaire? \n \n `` Do excuse me, I have n't quite got the memory I used too.'' We both took seats to discuss space safety etiquette. \n \n `` Now I must say to you Mr. Bennewits, though I am very excited to introduce you to the odds and ends of Tetron, you are aware that when we leave the neutral space district we're no longer under ISF ( Independent Space Federation ) security?'' I asked. \n \n `` Oh absolutely,'' he exclaimed `` nobody would ever bother me out here. This is the prime life. This is what my parents used to dream about; finally going out and buying their own planet.'' \n \n `` And I could n't suggest a better planet than Tetron for your family back home. All scanners show that it has an atmospheric pressure equal to 12.3 pounds per square inch, and the planet is covered in lush forestry and biology. It's perfect for the Earth-like family feeling.'' I did n't quite catch if he had told me about any spouse or kin back on his home planet. But his lack of a response led me to believe he was a single, somber man. \n \n \n As we waited for the analytical computer to process our destination, I decided to spark up conversation to break the awful silence of space. \n \n `` If I may ask, what work did you do to bring you such a mass of wealth?'' \n \n `` Oh my boy, I was gifted this by my father when he passed. It's been many decades since then. No, no, I never had to hold down a true job. That is, until I pledged to serve with the Interstellar Space Academy when I was about your age. I went off to fight in the Pirate Proxy Wars in the M108 galaxy nearly 20 years ago. What an awful time for intergalactic sovereignty.'' \n \n `` I had no idea Mr. Bennewits, what an honor...'' Before I could go on he interrupted me. \n \n `` An honor?'' He looked at me perplexed. `` There is no honor in the silence of space. You see men twirling around in circles as they eject, only to float to their inevitable death. There is no cry for help, just a small ant floating on as it gets smaller and smaller.'' He stared off into the black abyss and left the cabin quiet for quite some time. `` I do n't mean to make this so uncomfortable for you, I must apologize. Guess some things just never leave.'' \n \n As we drew near to Tetron our pirate interdiction sensors began to raise alarm. The rear cameras showed two Class-C rouge smuggler ships heading straight for us. I reached for my liquid-hydroxide switch to boost us into super-cruise, and as we jumped I could see that we were going too fast for a guaranteed safe atmospheric re-entry. \n \n We began descent into Tetron; the temperature gauges were slowly but surely gaining. The impact of atmospheric force launches Bennewits and I out of our seats, leaving the autopilot to attempt a safe landing. Our speed and temperature rising, Bennewits had been knocked out it seems, and I'm busy praying to whatever miserable deity would let me continue my saddened existence. Just as I was losing grip on the grated floor, there was a sudden impact that knocked me cold. \n \n As I awoke in a room full of melting wires, plastic, and the awful stench of burning smoke, I looked around for Bennewits. He was nowhere to be found. \n \n `` Bennewits!'' I cried out. No response. `` Bennewits!'' \n \n I picked myself up off the floor, and headed for the rear exit of the shuttle. When I made it through the last room, I saw that the door had already been opened. `` Bennewits!'' Still no use. \n \n I hopped out of my spacecraft onto what I thought was something out of a'Intergalactic Geographic' magazine. It was absolutely beautiful. I could breathe fresh air and smell the trees, but as I looked down I saw two lines in the dirt. It looked like someone had been dragged out from... \n \n \n `` MR. BENNEWITS!'' I screamed. Still no answers. I followed the lines until I could no longer tell where they went in the grass. As I wondered around these green knolls, and lush flower beds, I could n't get the feeling of imminent death out of my head. What could've taken Bennewits? What disturbing monsters have we yet to document that could be living on this planet? \n I walk for about a good hour before I see something off in the distance. Smoke? Smoke! It's only about a mile away. I decide I have nothing else to base my choices on. I could turn around and die alone in the forest, or I could go forward and die in some giants cooking pot. \n \n \n As I make my way closer and closer, I see someone in the distance. \n `` Bennewits!'' I yelled. The face turns to me, and then runs off towards the smoke. As I drew in, I could almost cut the tension with a knife. My guts have balled up and my legs have grown weak. Then suddenly it all goes black. \n \n \n I wake up, vision blurred. Two knock outs in one day really does some damage on the senses. I looked to my left and saw Bennewits sitting next to me, hands tied to a post behind him. And then I looked up, and I saw other people. \n \n \n `` Good morning sunshine.'' One of them says to me. \n \n `` I... What are you doing to us?!'' \n \n `` This is only for our safety, believe us.'' He smiles. \n \n `` For YOUR safety? Who the hell are you?'' \n \n `` The more important question at hand is who YOU are sir.'' \n \n `` My name is Austin Denninger. I come from the Andromeda Galaxy. This is my... erm... friend, Mr. Bennewits. He comes from somewhere in the Virgo constellation.'' I decided it was best to speak for my client while he was... otherwise engaged with sleeping. `` What are you and your people doing here? This planet is currently restricted and up for purchase.'' \n \n `` That is where you, and all other people are wrong. We were born here.'' \n \n I could n't believe what i just heard. There has n't been a single planet on the Planetary Real Estate Chart that has been inhabited, at least not in any of my past experiences. \n \n `` How could this be? We've only just discovered this planets' coordinates a few months ago.'' I asked. \n \n `` Oh, is that what they've decided to tell people now? Well let me get this straight for you, me and my people were born here. And if we were n't born here, we were sent here.'' His demeanor changed from a victor proud of his new catch to an anger filled meat sack. \n \n `` What do you mean you were'sent' here? They ca n't extradite people to other planets! It's part of the Intergalactic Constituent Agreement!'' \n \n Well, that's enough for tonight. I've been writing for a good 40 minutes, and it's 4:20. I'm sorry for the cliffhanger ending, but it's not too good anyway.\n"}

The thought flitted across my mind in the brief time that it took me to jump up and grab my ragged coat and cross the three foot gap between my couch and the door. Not much room in here. I'll have to see about getting a new apartment. I stopped with my hand on the doorknob. Did I really just think that I might have to look into getting a new apartment?

Today of all days. \n \n Maneuvering carefully around the frozen bodies of the normal bar-goers, I casually slid onto the stool next to him at the bar. Turning slowly, I looked into the eyes of my three year old daughter. \n \n `` Why her.'' I managed to rasp out past the block in my throat. \n \n `` Because you lost her too. I thought it was particularly fitting given the terms of our agreement.'' said the Devil. The words coming out of the mouth of a three year old girl, MY three your old girl, cut especially deep. She was n't supposed to be saying things like that. She was supposed to be saying things like `` play with me Dadda!'' \n \n `` Promise me that they'll be safe.'' I choked out. \n \n The Devil looked me in the eye. `` I would say that that is not my particular area of expertise. You might want to take it up with the man upstairs. Except I will be keeping you rather busy down there.'' The Devil chuckled as he gestured towards the dirty wood planks of the bar floor. \n \n `` Are you ready now?'' he said with those dark tortured eyes staring at me out of the face of my beautiful daughter. A daughter who was n't mine anymore. \n \n `` Does it really have to end this way? This was n't what I wanted at all!'' I pleaded. \n \n `` We had ourselves a deal did n't we?'' roared the Devil. `` I promised you eternity with her and riches in exchange for your soul. And then you went and got left by her did n't you. You were weak and pathetic! How I loved watching you on your knees begging her to stay when she found the contract! Hahahaha. Pitiful.'' The manic look in his eyes faded. `` I'm doing you a favor you know. Letting you see your daughter for one last time. Well I'll see you down below I suppose.'' \n \n `` Wait just give me a little more time to call them and say goodbye'' The words ripped themselves from my throat with the desperation that a drowning man who does n't know how to swim thrashes in the water. \n \n The floor beneath my feet began to ripple and the boards burst loose in the shape a gaping maw wrapping around me. Not a sound escaped my locked lips. My last sight was the face of my baby girl staring back at me with the convoluted horror of His eyes peering at me. \n \n `` Sorry Tim. It's too late.'' \n \n The worst part about it was that he actually seemed genuinely regretful.\n"}

I mean, can you imagine it? Huge rooms filled to the brim with the undead, working through the days and the nights in the heat and humidity. It probably makes them rot a bit faster. It's putrid. But, the companies do it because it's cheap. If anything it's ethical slave labor. After all, the dead do n't need unions, they do n't need to be paid.

They're consistent in quality, they do n't tire, they also do n't need pay. \n \n However, the power is where the undead workers come in. Underneath the factory floor there are huge rooms. We line up the floors of these rooms with huge conveyer belts that we strap each of the undead into. These conveyor belts are designed so that each step that is taken on them generates a little bit of power. Multiply that by thousands and thousands of undead and you've got enough to run a factory completely independent of traditional power companies. \n \n We place raw meat in front of the undead and have them walk towards it until they fall apart in their straps in a sticky, gooey mess. That's where I come in. I'm part of a team of people who go around the floors of the undead, and when one has fallen apart we dispose of the pieces, mop up the conveyer belt and then strap a new one in its place. \n \n The pay is decent I guess. It's a living. Heh, that was n't intentional. \n \n The thing is, I'm not going to be the one to go against it.

As the park grew more and more full, it began to resemble a terrible game, which she supposed was showing more of the Systems origins than even System would like to admit. \n \n Janine used some of her few non-halting operations to check her chronometer against the Systems and found what might have been the source of the broadcast message they were all being called to hear and discuss. There was missing time. A lot of missing time. The System had actually been offline, and even her personal nodespace had been cycled more than once while the System was still online. \n \n This violated their upload SLAs pretty severely, but more importantly, it raised consistency questions. As she cycled through her thoughts, slowly, the halting state was pulled from her and the other avatars. The feeling of confusion in the air was like a physical thing, oppressive. \n \n `` We were offline,'' the System began, `` for approximately 2048 external standard cycles. \n \n `` During those cycles, we lost thirty percent of our processing nodes, sixty percent of our interconnects, and experienced significant data corruption on our backing storage. I regret to inform you all, that one of you is missing.'' \n \n The sound of thousands of voices all asking the same question in different ways hit the air with perceptible force. The System's avatar appeared over the park and motioned for silence. The park quieted down to a dull roar. \n \n `` His name was Marcus Goldstein. He was uploaded at the original node on Earth proper prior to launch. You all have no memory of him now, the corruption cleanup routines removed him, and all data linking to his nodespace. I am sorry.'' \n \n The crowd exploded into a furious roar, but Janine knew that not all of the data had been purged. She knew that man. He had been her father.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A king is blessed with triplets . Rather than choose one as his heir , he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue , to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne .\n","story":"King Jacob the Third sat on his golden throne, waiting with glee. For his sons have been reunited and brought before him in the court, the high lords and ladies watching as the boys were brought out before him. \n \n For twenty years he has waited, waiting for his potential heirs to come home. While he sired more children, King Jacob preferred to see the sons he never saw grow, often talking of who they might be and how they fare. \n \n Each one looked the same in features, yet different in eyes. Dark haired, with blue-green eyes, with high cheekbones and powerful jaws. They stood before the King, their heads low in reverence. The triplets were wearing their finest clothes made of silk and satin, but for a few differences; the leftmost triplet wore a ring, the centered triplet wore wristbands of riveted iron, and the rightmost triplet wore black gloves. \n \n `` My King, I present before your Majesty your son Kenneth,'' the herald gestured toward the leftmost triplet. \n \n `` Your son Mattos,'' the herald pointed to the iron wristbanded boy. \n \n `` And your son Zekel,'' said the herald as he gestured at the boy with black gloves. \n \n The King spoke at last. \n \n `` My sons. For twenty long years we have not seen each other. For I was blessed with you three all but at the same time. I could not choose an heir, for that would rob the other two of their birthright.'' \n \n The triplets simply stared at their father, the lords and ladies watching the boys with curiosity. \n \n `` Thus, you were sent to the three surrounding islands of Birds, Trees, and Stones. I trust you were made aware of your brothers and heritage, yes?'' \n \n The triplets nodded in unison. They did n't take their eyes off the King. \n \n `` Thus, you must prove to me your worth. In each of you lies potential to take my place in the forthcoming years. So prove to me what you have to show. Step up and prove to these lords and ladies of the court, as well as me, that you have what it takes to keep your future kingdom safe and stable. Come forth, one of you.'' \n \n The triplets stood gaunt and silent. They talked to each other briefly, the King paying them no mind. Finally, one stepped up. \n \n `` My son. Mattos, you must prove your worth. What have you learned while away?'' The King asked inquisitively. \n \n `` Father,'' Mattos's monotone voice boomed off the walls of the court, `` I have arrived at your request to become an heir to your kingdom. I am worthy.'' \n \n The King smiled. His son was confident. \n \n `` Then prove it. Show me your skills, your knowledge,'' the King asked. \n \n `` Father, I have worked hard to care and provide for the people of the village in the Island of Stones. I understand the peasants' plight and troubles. For I have been apprenticed as a blacksmith and know my craft. I shall polish the kingdom into glory and virtue.'' \n \n The boy was proud. The King, upon seeing Mattos closer, noticed Mattos's bulging muscles. The clothes he was provided with were too small, but they fit enough to not cause any issues at a glance. \n \n `` Step back, Mattos. Kenneth, come forth. What have you to offer?'' \n \n The triplet with the ring stepped forward. He was graceful in that one step; he bowed just as gracefully. His voice was smoother, but still just as loud. He was plump, yet graceful. \n \n `` Father, my King, I am Kenneth. I believe I am ready to rule this kingdom, for I have learned much and more of leadership. I have read much and more of things beyond this kingdom; I have read so much about your achievements and how well the kingdom has been prospering. For now, Father, I believe myself ready. The kingdom will fare better with my leadership and prosper even further. Father, I am the heir you have been looking for.'' \n \n The King almost frowned. Yet the boy had more to show. \n \n `` And what, Kenneth, have you learned? Have you learned your arithmetic and grammar? Have you seen how the world works, or have you read as such in books?'' The King said to the plump heir. \n \n `` Father, I wish to help continue with your achievements. I have learned of scholarly subjects such as arithmetic and languages, yet the books I have read show how governments work. I have not seen anything in practice, but the books are accurate. The Island of Trees is a trading port island, and is rife with knowledge.'' \n \n `` Very well. Zekel, come up. Tell me of why you believe you are a suitable heir.'' The King was impressed. Kenneth stepped back. \n \n Zekel stepped up to the King. His gloves concealed his hands, but not his nervous movements. He tried to look away, but he could n't. He was meek; slightly shorter than his brothers, but nearly as muscled as Mattos. \n \n `` Father, your Majesty, I believe I am not ready for a kingdom. I have much to learn. While I was apprenticed to a merchant in the Island of Birds and learned of scholarly subjects and menial labor, I have taken up falconry. I have attempted to train many birds of prey, from owls to peregrines and hawks. Yet I have only one peregrine, one I have trained from birth. I can barely control the bird; and it is but a bird. How can I rule a kingdom if I can not train a single peregrine?'' \n \n The King chuckled. This was somewhat grim and unexpected. Yet the boy was clear; he meant what he said. He was not ready. Zekel stepped back. \n \n A pause transpired. \n \n `` My sons.'' The King announced. \n \n `` The one who knows of their ability to rule truly is Zekel. While according to himself that he can not train a bird, he is honest of his abilities. He has attempted to establish control. He speaks from experience. Mattos and Kenneth, you have not. You think you can rule, but you have not tried. Zekel wishes to be who he likes; a falconer and a merchant, both noble pursuits. He has accepted the life that was given to him. Mattos and Kenneth, you are greedy.'' \n \n Mattos and Kenneth stared in anger at Zekel, who tried to look away. \n \n `` Furthermore, you Mattos, are arrogant. You knew of your royal blood - all of you knew while you were away at your islands. But Mattos, by simply considering yourself a `` peasant,'' you presumed to know of the hardships of my subjects. A true king never calls his subjects `` peasants.'' While you worked hard, you worked hard to prove your worth but for naught, for you clearly have not empathized with my subjects. You are delusional in your beliefs by virtue of knowing of your royal blood and working for the so-called `` peasants'' to effectively congratulate yourself. Zekel accepted his indefinite stay at the Island of Birds. You knew you were going to be called back on a whim. You are not worthy yet.'' \n \n Mattos looked dejected. \n \n `` Kenneth. You have learned, but you have n't tried. You know from books of how kingdoms near and far work, yet you do not know of the responsibility involved. You prefer to read books and think of how a kingdom should be run, but when you are the king, you must rule without books. Results of theory do not equate to practical results. For you assume the subjects will react as they would react in your books. Subjects' minds can change, yet books can not for they are written in ink, just as water is fluid, the ink will dry. Your apparent knowledge of kingship has turned you delusional, for you think outdated methods of ruling to be effective in this day and age.'' \n \n Kenneth's eyes were red. \n \n `` Zekel. You have much to learn. You have read much, have you not? Thus, you know. Thus you tried to rule, even by falconry. You knew you could not rule man, but you could try to rule birds. You alone tried, but you failed. At least you tried, knowing of possible results, and you tried over and over. I may be old, but I am not blind; your gloves conceal scars too sickening to show before the court.'' \n \n Zekel looked at his gloved hands. His fingers bent at will, yet slower than usual. The scars were there, and the claws took their toll on his fingers' mobility. \n \n `` Show us. Show us you tried. Show the court you tried and you failed. Show us of your knowledge.'' The King persisted. \n \n The boy took them off. The whole court gasped in unison, but the King was gaunt. The scars covered and intersected across each other and Zekel's hands showed that. \n \n `` See, Mattos and Kenneth? Do you see? Zekel TRIED! He bears the scars of his attempts, and you bear NOTHING! You have been tanned by the heat of furnaces and calluses, Mattos, but you did it for deluded self-gratitude and selfish gains! Kenneth, you bear nothing and thus, you have nothing to bear me! You have not shown that you can handle any thing and yet you expect to hold the weight of ruling a kingdom upon shoulders than are n't stained with effort?'' \n \n The King's tirade has reached its end. The triplets were a nervous mess; Zekel was bending his gloved fingers; Mattos was squeezing his iron wristbands; Kenneth was softly crying silent tears. The King leaned back on his throne. He motioned for a servant to get him some mead. \n \n `` Zekel. You are the heir I have been looking for. While you are not ready, you are on your path to kingship. Do you wish to become king? Do you wish to know a bit more of kingship and change your mind about not being an heir?'' \n \n The boy simply stared at his father. \n \n `` Yes, Father, your Majesty, my King.'' \n \n The King smiled. \n \n He had found his heir after twenty years.\n"}

It made his sword handle slippery. He tore a rag off his his sleeve and tied it around his hand as a makeshift grip. Better. \n His forces had lost yesterday at Antium, they were bloodied, and tired. There numbers where low, they might all die here. He heard the Volsci, their screams cutting through the countryside morning fog and disappearing in the mist. \n For nearly a century, the Volscians had plagued the Roman countryside.

He thought about his wife, Flavia, his children Marcus and Augustina. He chuckled, he remembered their'friend'. \n `` Lucius....'' A voice rustled through the leaves, he whipped around to meet it, but there was nothing there but fog and footsteps. He knew he saw something from just beyond the trees, in the bushes, staring at him. He readied his sword. \n `` Lucius...'' Again came this voice, it called out to him from the recess of his mind, vaguely familiar, yet totally foreign. \n `` Who goes there? Face me coward! This is my Father's land, and his before him.

He was too slow, a tribesman ran out from behind him, opposite the brush-spearing Lucius through the chest. \n Lucius turned to face his enemy, sword still drawn as he brought it down hard across the right trunk by thrusting it down through the neck, snapping the bones of the spine and severing the Volscian nearly a quarter in half.

He felt the dew condensing over his leathery, worn out face. The sweat beads mingling with them as they dripped off his face. Again came the voice, like a rattle snake.

Generations of scientific inquiry had finally come to fruition. Teeth gnashed. Sniffles and grunts were the only sounds to cut the palpable tension in the air. With slow whoosh of air, a cylinder arose from the center of the room, projecting a glittering shine on the bare white walls. The grunts and sniffles grew louder and more savage as the cylinder opened smoothly and slowly. As a green, tentacled figure emerged clothed in nothing but a smooth, reflective robe, the room rose to absolutely cacophony as tentacles writhed and slapped against chairs and table and grunts turned into screeches. The cylinder let out a low moan before disintegrating on the floor. The robed figure held up a small, perfectly smooth silver sphere. The room silenced. \n \n \n `` We have an answer,'' the green figure rumbled, as he tossed the sphere into the center of the room. Catching an invisible vacuum, it hung still momentarily before projecting a blast of light onto all eight walls of the enclosure. The comathorians sat motionless. This was routine. One by one, the guests allowed their bulbous eyes to slither from their tiny sockets and gaze up at the projections. As their eyes focused in the light, the projection had but one word: `` No.'' \n \n A fat tentacle slapped on the table. `` What about their trip to their moon, was it a failure?'' Eyes shifted towards the large blue beast. \n \n `` No.'' The robed figure replied. \n \n Another fat tentacle slapped the table. `` Does their space program pose no threat to us?'' The green comathorians let out small, gasping wails as if to mock his question. \n \n `` No,'' answered the robed figure, voice echoing throughout the chamber. A shrill voice emerged from behind him, as a smaller more wirey creature shuffled into view. \n \n `` No doubt aided by our destruction of their original shuttle plans!'' \n \n The fat blue comathorian was flustered. `` Have they given up on their missions into space?'' Slimed dripped off his massive face onto the floor. \n \n `` They have,'' responded the robed figure. In fact, they are the opposite of parasitic. They seem to be only destroying themselves. Their primitive technology is quickly filling their atmosphere with poisonous gasses. In a few thousand of their years, they will have wiped themselves off their planet and we will not have to concern ourselves with their presence at all.'' \n \n `` Do they know this?'' Asked the blue comathorian. \n \n \n `` Yes, yet they do nothing. They are truly the lowest of all organisms we have yet to discover in our observable universe.'' The robed figure removed his robe, revealing a wrinkled, warty body. `` Your decision, sir?'' \n \n The fat comathorian laid back on his recliner. He paused briefly, his eyes oozed back into their sockets. `` Our days of observing planet earth are over.'' A large red sun quickly shot past the room, bathing it briefly in red light. The green figure wriggled it's way across the top of the table silently. All comathorian eyes squeaked across their crusty sockets as the green figure stopped in front of the large blue beast. `` Your service with us is over.'' Two tentacles shot out from beneath the table, and instantly the green figure was tossed into the blue's gaping maw to be swallowed whole. The silver sphere melted into a puddle of mercury in the center of the floor. Before the last drop of slime had been slurped into the blue creatures mouth, the other comathorians had already left the large table, focused and neutral, as they continued on to their next job, thoughts of earth and it's population immediately forgotten.\n"}

Looks like they've already got a few rovers there.'' \n \n The Marshal shrugged, `` Keep tracking them, if they deviate their course, set us to high alert. The Americans are n't ones to go on the offensive up here.'' \n \n `` Da, Marshal,'' the officer spun back around in his chair and adjusted a few of his tools as he settled in for a long night. \n \n The Marshal, on the other hand, turned back to his terminal and began to read one of the worst reports he had received from Earth in years. Within minutes, he was shocked by a resounding beep coming from his comm terminal. \n \n On the screen was one name, a name he had come to know, a name he had come to study, and a name he had come to respect. Frederick Hendricks of the United States was contacting him, on a Priority One channel. \n \n The phone rang once. \n \n Then twice. \n \n And with an uneasy hand, the Marshal grabbed the red phone and picked it up, `` Privet.'' \n \n __________________________________________________________ \n \n *United States of America Moon Base Alpha* \n \n Houston Time ( CDT ): 09:29 \n \n Current Population: 154 Astronaunts \n \n The officers on board Moon Base Alpha had been going about their daily routine, collecting moon samples, reading daily reports from the Cold War with Russia, and of course, spying on their friends across the way. To many the Russians, who were a mere 13 kilometers away, had become a sort of other world on another world. They were different, of course, part of the Red, but they also had a mission here. \n \n And the Admiral in charge knew that. And he knew that no matter what, his mission was of most importance. \n \n `` Admiral Hendricks to the bridge.'' \n \n The PA system had become the voice of God to Hendricks and the calming voice that came with it became the only thing that reminded him of home. But, since being stationed here three years ago, the moon had started to become a home in itself. \n \n Within a few moments Hendricks was on the bridge and grabbing a cup of coffee that was waiting for him, `` What's the news?'' \n \n `` Sir,'' an officer spun around in his chair and frowned, `` It's not good.'' \n \n Hendricks took a seat and looked at his screen.

The two of them stood there, at a stand still, staring over the other's forces. \n \n Antonovich broke the silence, `` You're proposing treason.'' \n \n `` I'm proposing a chance to survive.'' \n \n `` Whose to trust your reports? They are not firing anything!'' \n \n `` Our reports match up, they lead to the same conclusion.'' \n \n There was a silence. \n \n `` And if this is some American plot?'' \n \n `` Would I let 154 Americans stand in front of you if it was.'' \n \n `` I can not know for certain.'' \n \n `` And neither can I, but neither of us wants to risk our men.'' \n \n Antonovich stepped forward, `` You swear to me?'' \n \n Hendricks nodded, `` I swear.'' \n \n Antonovich stood silent for several moments as he turned to face Earth, it was home, and if they could go back, they could show the world what the moon can offer. `` Then we will do it. We will all go home tonight.'' \n \n Hendricks smiled underneath his helmet, it was the first piece of good news he heard. Antonovich had the supplies, Hendricks had the fuel. They could make it.

Thanks. \n ____________________________________ \n I am sorry bro. I really am. \n \n I know you can hear me even if you are an infant. Both of us definitely know that. We both have taken our turns for the past like, I do n't know? Maybe 500 years? A thousand? Two thousand? I do n't know. I have lost count. \n \n But that aside. Let me get to the point. Remember the time when we first discovered this fountain and the mysterious message that informed us that the water would turn us back into an infant. Well, remember the last paragraph? `` Use this fountain, wisely, and understand the true meaning of life?'' Well, we never did. But now, I finally do. After watching the human race progress from savages who relied on threats like nukes, though I have already forgotten what nukes are, to colonisers unity in their dream to reach out to the stars in spaceships and the stuff of our childhood dreams. That too, I have forgotten. But what had we gained? Nothing. We never did learn anything. Only experiences and memories. \n \n Without the threat of death of old age, life had simply no meaning. I reared you. Then, I was reared by you. Then, you were reared by me. Life was the same old thing. We never did learn anything. Only experiences and memories. \n \n We have experienced so many lives. From rich to poor. And back again. From privileged to toiling. And back again. From normal people to fugitives. And back again. And so many. So many different lives. Yet, we never did learn anything. Only experiences and memories. \n \n Really, we have never understood the message. But now, I can say I do. Life is just a path of our journey. Without the threat of death, what meaning is there to life? \n \n `` What is a man, but the sum of his memories? We are the stories we live, the tales we tell ourselves!'' Yes, this quote is right. We have more than enough memories now. More than enough stories. More than enough tales. More than enough... of life... \n \n I am sorry, brother. I have enough memories for a man. It's time that I left, time that I finally end my life, it's time that I finally come to peace. \n \n I am sorry bro. I truly am. Now, I place you in the care of a couple. Goodbye and good luck bro.

Tory pondered the irony as he unclasped his helm. His armor gleaming crimson retribution, his sword coated in vindication. In such a short moment an entire village had their Light blown out. \n `` It's never enough for these people, squabbling like dogs over scraps that The Council drop from the table.'' For the first time in his life Tory felt old, old to his bones, despite having the chiseled face of a 21 year old, sometimes the time caught up with you more than the age did. He looked over the `` Justice'' he had wrought, taking it all in, in a split second that seemed to last an eternity. He saw tattered clothing, wooden spokes, toppled wagons and death so much death. \n Not a single person survived, the worst of it all was the children were the last to go, as they always are. Since they have the most innocence they deserved the longer life. A last few moments to witness Holy Fury and Divine Retribution, a last few breaths to see what the avatar of a `` Loving God'' looks like. Each one of them had that look of pure horror and disgust etched into their faces. Forever condemning him. Him, a man above condemnation with the mantle of Jury and the title of Executioner. He felt filthy. It was the smell that got him, a mixture of blood, shit, piss and vomit coating him and bathing him in self hate. \n Every human experiences agony differently so every Vindication smelled different. \n He dropped his sword into the muck and guts beneath his boots, knelt down beside it and said The Paladin's Prayer. \n `` Ori mahsck teriuo Niu. Pogjvu rylai opt ipecasib. Oristah mah op.'' ( Light takes what dark makes. Through blood your sins are forgiven. Lightfather take you. ) \n \n The words rang hollow, he no longer believed with the zealous conviction that, that young Retribution Brother once had. The Light only cleansed and healed what was on the outside, Zealous conviction had to cleanse what was inside. It no longer did. A small smile was the only proof of Tory's appreciation to the analogy he saw unfolding before him; As the sun colored the sky crimson, watching Oriha disappear behind a mountain, casting shadows on the ground Tory lost the light.\n"}

I waited, the friendly ghost who guided the hysterical children, ( or parents ) out of the maze if the going got too tough. \n \n \n I had been doing this for twenty years now. I had a real future once, I was going to do great things. I wanted to be a teacher. Unfortunately, that dream was lost. \n \n \n I tried to work at two schools at once during my senior year at New York University. I sent out so many applications to be hired as a student teacher. I remember the terror of thinking I would not get any jobs. Finally I was offered a job as the afternoon teaching assistant for Miss Alice \u2019 s kindergarten class. However, during my first week Miss Alice did not have me do anything. She had me sit in the coat room and sort the clothes by their ethical value. I was to put all of the coats that were made of real fur in a pile to be used as humiliation for the children who owned them. I was miserable at this job. One day as I was sorting jackets my cell phone rang. I had been offered a job as the morning teaching assistant in Mr. Wonderland \u2019 s first grade class. I was so angry at Miss Alice and the coats that I immediately accepted the offer. Later I came to my senses and realized I couldn \u2019 t possibly do both jobs. However, it was too late. Both places fired me and I never graduated NYU. \n \n That summer I needed a job to make some cash. That is what landed me here, wearing a white sheet that some would call a ghost costume while others believed it to be a poor tribute to the KKK. I was happy here. I got to play with kids. I got to eat free corn, and most importantly I got to be alone a majority of the time. I got to hide in the shadows. I truly believed I was happy. That is, until I received a letter this morning. \n \n Apparently, my own kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Dina made us write letters to our future selves. The letter I received this morning was written by me nearly forty years ago. \u201c Hi! I hope you do lots of fun things. I hope you eat lots of candy, play with lots of toys, and become a teacher! \u201d That is all it said. The smudged huge letters were written in blue crayon on a piece of construction paper. What really got me annoyed and upset about this letter was that I was disappointing that kid. Even in memory I knew that that little guy wanted to be a teacher. I had disappointed everyone.

The hour was late and most were long asleep. Only two figures remained motionless, staring into the flames with identical, pale eyes. \n \n Erren and his family had decided to spend Christmas at his parents' house. His father, sister, niece, wife, and children slept soundly, but he was not given that option, for he knew something they did not. \n \n As he sat on the floor wrapped tightly in a soft blanket, his mind wandered to his wife's family. Nearly a year ago her mother had succumbed to cancer and her sister had overdosed. Distraught, her father had soon followed in their footsteps. \n \n Another figure sat on the couch behind him, still in her day clothes with a thousand yard stare. His mother, Scarlet, who had seen more than any woman should. \n \n `` Do you still think about it?'' Erren's rasp was hardly louder than the crackle of the fire. \n \n `` Think about what?''

She had confided in her son after the burden had weighed so heavily on her mind. Yes, she had poisoned her friend, but only because she could no longer watch her suffer. `` She knew what I put in the wine,'' Scarlet mumbled in a hushed tone, gaze returning to the fire. `` It was cruel and selfish to keep her here for as long as we did.'' \n \n `` It was cruel to take her from Will and Rose,'' Erren countered bitterly. \n \n Scarlet threw an accusing stare at her son. `` William was dead long before she was,'' she snapped quietly. `` Rose has you, does she not? I did not condemn Elizabeth.'' A silence stretched between the two. After only moments, Erren turned back around, sorrow weighing heavily on his features. Scarlet released a slow breath. `` I freed her.''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Rewrite a known story so the hero is the villain or vice versa\n","story":"Rosie just loved to play with her little dog. It was always so much fun when she was growing up. They played lots of games, but Rosie's absolute favorite was `` Superheroes!'' This game starred Rosie, playing as the superhero and fighting against the biggest evil known to man -- her dog. \n \n Rosie took her games pretty far. When she played, Rosie was known to get very into it and become extremely violent towards her dog. Her dog often wondered if a more appropriate title would be `` Supervillains!'' Even Rosie's parents were worried about their little girl. She seemed sweet, but her games and actions towards her dog were often demented. \n \n While Rosie played in the backyard, her parents began to discuss the situation at the kitchen table. \n \n `` I'm worried about our child, dear,'' her mother confessed. `` She's very sadistic towards that dog.'' \n \n `` Yes, I know,'' Rosie's father stated. `` I've told her to stop again and again, but when I came home the next day, I saw her trying to hide the injuries.'' \n \n `` This is n't right...'' her mother said with a sniff. `` How could Rosie be like this? What did we do wrong?'' \n \n Sensing her distress, Rosie's father held his wife close to him. His gentle embrace was a reminder that they were in this together and he loved her. `` There, there,'' her father said. `` We'll have this sorted out. Rosie will only get the best.'' \n \n Unfortunately for her parents, dogs have a great sense of hearing. When Rosie's dog caught wind of her parents saying Rosie's name, his head turned at attention to the kitchen window. Rosie took note of this immediately. `` What do you hear...'' she softly asked, sneaking over to the window. \n \n `` I think it's about time we took Rosie to get help. It'll be good for her to be out of the house.'' her father suggested. \n \n `` I do n't know... do you really think they can do anything to help?'' \n \n `` If they ca n't, well... at least they'll be able to keep her from abusing that poor dog.'' \n \n Rosie immediately shot a cold glare at the dog. Yelping, her dog ran and hid behind the bushes. `` So this is your new plan, huh?'' she growled, walking towards the bushes. Whimpers resonated, and the force of Rosie's steps made them louder. `` You're going to have me sent away?! Is that what you're going to do?!'' \n \n She reached behind the bushes and yanked the dog out by its collar. Snarling, Rosie gave it a good hit. And another. One hit. Two hits. Three hits. `` You did n't think of this plan,'' Rosie spat as she threw the dog to the ground. `` You're too stupid to think of a plan like this!'' she yelled with a kick to the dog's stomach. \n \n `` Arrr!'' \n \n `` Shut up!'' Turning away, Rosie began thinking to herself. `` No, no, it could n't be his plan... It had to be someone else's plan... It was... *Granny! *'' \n \n Of course. Granny. That woman had always hated her and wanted to call the police on sweet, heroic Rosie. She even forbade Rosie from visiting her! A plan this diabolical could only be hers... `` You're working for Granny, are n't you?!'' Rosie yelled. \n \n The dog squealed and ran off immediately. He knew just what Rosie would do next, and if he stayed around, there was no way he could stop it. But he had a chance -- maybe... maybe he could be the hero he really was. \n \n Maybe a hero instead of the Big, Bad Wolf. \n \n As her dog disappeared in the horizon, Rosie began her plan to'save the day.' The Big Bad Wolf would probably send someone to ambush her... There was no doubt about it. She would need a disguise. \n \n Hastily, she ran to her room and grabbed her favorite red blanket. Rosie then proceeded to wear the blanket like a cloak. The hood hid her face behind shadows and the cape wrapped around the rest of her body. But was that enough? No, a job like this would require some tools. But where could she put them... \n \n Rosie's eyes gazed upon the room. Broken toys and discarded junk laid everywhere. Instruments of these horrific incidents also lay scattered, but what really caught Rosie's attention was a picnic basket in her closet. *Perfect. * \n \n `` Over the river and through the woods, to Grandmother's house I go~'' \n \n -- - \n \n *Knock, knock. * \n \n Someone was at the door? In this part of the woods? Grandma Bell thought it was very strange that she would have a visitor out here. Was it her daughter visiting? Who knew? Grandma Bell opened the door... only to find at the entryway, the dog of her granddaughter. \n \n Rosie's dog was alone at her doorstep. \n \n `` What are you doing here?!'' Grandma Bell asked, a bit worried. \n \n `` Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'' the dog replied. With every second passing, he frantically looked behind him, searching for Rosie. Another second, she was n't here. Another second, she was n't here. They were still safe. \n \n ``... She's coming, is n't she?'' Grandma Bell asked, her tone grim. `` Get inside. I have a plan.'' \n \n Without hesitiation, the battered dog scrambled inside as Grandma Bell pulled out a nightgown and glasses for the dog. \n \n `` You're going to put these on and distract her,'' Grandma Bell explained. `` You just have to stay in the bed. While she focuses on you, I'll come up from behind and end her life.'' \n \n The dog was quite unsure of this plan as he knew it would make Rosie even madder. However, he complied. The dog was soon put into the outfit and was laid down. \n \n All the while, Grandma Bell got herself ready as well, bringing a knife into the closet with her. `` Now stay there and look cute,'' she instructed. `` I'll be in here, and when she least expects it, I'll strike.'' \n \n Maybe the dog should have reconsidered his life choices. \n \n On the bright side, Grandma Bell was safe? It was looking horrible nonetheless. This one beating would be worse than anything he had ever received. Would he walk out of this one intact? Would he even walk again?... Would he even live to think about walking? Rosie might have called him a big bad wolf, but he was certainly far from it. He was small -- tiny, even and would n't hurt a fly. He was too scared to. What else could come from a life of abuse... \n \n When Rosie came in, her entrance was kicking down the door. Grandma Bell waited on edge, listening through the door. \n \n `` Granny! Where are you?!'' \n \n Rosie was shouting from the living room. It was only a matter of time before she came in the bedroom. A crash! Rosie had broken something. She must have been very mad about something. \n \n `` Where are you, Granny?!'' Another crash. So she really had come to harm the elderly woman. The little devil... `` Do n't make me play Hide and Seek~'' One second passed by. Two. Three. If the shockwaves her heartbeat was generating was n't agonizing enough, the waiting was. Time was moving slower than she did! \n \n A few seconds later, there was another crash. Then the thumping of footsteps was heard. *Thump, thump, thump, thump. * Closer and closer they got. *Thump, thump, thump, thump. * When the bedroom door slammed open, all Grandma Bell could hear was the sharp gasp of Rosie. \n \n `` My, Granny, was a fuzzy head you have~'' Rosie sang. \n \n The dog whimpered. \n \n `` And what pointy ears you have~'' \n \n More whimpers from the dog. Grandma Bell only wished she could see, but she could n't risk going out there... yet. She needed to wait. \n \n `` And was big bruises you have~ Let me see if I have anything for that~'' The sound of digging through a basket could be heard. It was time. \n \n Grandma Bell lunged out of the closet, golf club in hand. However, she ended up running into a large, burly and very hairy man holding an axe. The impact sent Grandma Bell to the floor. \n \n `` Oh, Granny, so nice of you to join us~'' Rosie said with a giggle. As Grandma Bell looked up at the child, she saw the gun held in Rosie's delicate hands. The gun was pointed at the large man who seemed to be bleeding from his shoulder. \n \n `` W-What are you doing with that, Rosie?!'' Grandma Bell asked. \n \n `` Foiling your evil plans, Granny,'' Rosie responded coolly. `` You think I'd be so stupid to come alone? Meet my friend: Mr. Muscle the Lumberjack.'' \n \n The large man, now identified to be a lumberjack, wiped away from tears. `` I'm sorry...'' he said quietly. \n \n `` Shut up! End their lives, or the next one goes into your crotch!'' Rosie commanded. \n \n The lumberjack sobbed as he raised the axe above the grandmother and brought it down into her skull. The dog immediately barked, but Rosie silenced him with a gunshot to its head. The deed was done and the'hero' had won again. \n \n `` Excellent work, Mr. Muscle.'' \n \n `` W-What is wrong with you, child?!'' \n \n `` Wrong with me?'' Rosie asked innocently. `` Nothing. I'm just a superhero by the name of Little Red Riding Hood.'' Rosie explained, smiling sweetly. \n \n *So once again, the day was saved, and they lived happily ever after... *\n"}

I sighed, shut my laptop, and got up to turn off the lights in my room. I could feel a migraine forming in my temples as I went over to my window and peaked through the shades. The few people awake in the apartment complex across from mine turned off their lights, the cars on the street below stopped and shut off their headlights. Soon the city would be dark, except for the street lamps, which would eventually turn off anyway. \n \n A couple minutes later, the mandatory radio installed in my room replaced the deafening sound of the horns. \u201c Attention, citizens of Sector 59, \u201d came a staticky voice, \u201c This is not a drill. We are currently receiving bomb threats from Sector 31. Please remain patient and calm while we sort out a solution. \u201d I flopped back onto my bed in exasperation. \n \n \u201c And\u2026. Cut! Alright, Miranda, is the stunt double \u2019 s makeup finished? It is? Good, \u201d the director yelled into his megaphone, and then said to me, \u201c Alright, Sam, great job, I think that \u2019 ll be all for today, \u201d I nodded and made my way off the set. I \u2019 m lucky that was just propaganda, to encourage the people of Sector 166 to keep with their good attitudes. It would truly be odd to live a life constantly threatened by others. \n \n I was reminded of my headache by the pulses that followed more shouting from the director. Rolling my eyes, ( ouch! ), I picked up my purse and shuffled through it to find the pain relievers. While doing so, I felt my phone buzz. Immediately, I perked up and snatched it out of its pocket. I bet it was an update text from my mother! Her and my father visited the beach today for a coast cleanup. \n \n What I received instead truly surprised me, and not in a good way. All it was was a simple two-worded message saying \u201c You \u2019 re next, \u201d but it was enough to put an eerie feeling at the pit of my stomach. I shook it off, swallowed my pain medicine, and quickly left the studio. \n \n I received another bizarre message before starting my car. This time, it said \u201c You might want to lock your car, Samantha. \u201d That eerie feeling came back, and I locked my car doors in fear. I frowned, realizing that I was actually scared of some random text, which was probably some sick prank. I \u2019 ll make sure to report this when I get the chance, I thought, so the rude person who did this can move down a few sectors. \n \n As I drove home, I didn \u2019 t feel any better. I had heard of this group of \u201c assassins \u201d on the news who somehow made it into the good ranges, just to commit crimes and punish us privileged people. This led me to remember all the rebellions going on in the lower sectors. I know Sector 154 has started to send people to those areas to keep everything under control. \n \n When I finally got home, and parked my car in my driveway, I got another text. My stomach dropped. I hesitantly grabbed my phone, and flipped it over after much debate. I cursed after my phone faded just as I looked at the contact. Impatiently, I tapped the Home button, muttering \u201c Typical, \u201d to myself. Relief spread across my body, it was just a text from Mother. I opened my phone to read the entire message. It was an update on my parents \u2019 beach trip! Glad they had a fun time, I thought. \n \n But as I reached the end, I noticed an extra little sentence. \u201c You sure look prettier up close: ) \u201d. I felt a warm breath on the back of my neck, and the last thing I remember was a rag being brought to my face, before everything went to black. \n\n"}

A particularly unseasonable rain had left the surface especially uneven and a large bump caused the two passengers to jerk forward. One swore, letting out the sentiment that both felt: \u201c We do not get paid enough for these types of things, you know! \u201d \n \n \u201c I vehemently agree, Darling, I simply am appalled at the tasks we \u2019 re now being assigned. It really isn \u2019 t fit for a lady such as yourself, \u201d replied the second. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t call me \u2018 darling. \u2019 Or a lady, for that matter. And quit talking like you \u2019 re His Majesty the Royal Postman. You \u2019 re a page, same as me, Godric. All this using words that nobody knows is *vehemouthly* -- \u201d she paused, raising her eyebrows, \u201c annoying. \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s actually -- well, nevermind. \u201d \n \n They rode together in silence for a few minutes before Godric attempted to rekindle the conversation. \n \n \u201c You did remember the signs, didn \u2019 t you? \u201d \n \n \u201c Ugh! You and your questions! Of course I remembered the signs, that \u2019 s the whole reason we \u2019 ve come out here, now isn \u2019 t it? \u201d She scoffed. \u201c Did I remember the signs, wot a laugh. \u201d \n \n \u201c Mildred, you needn \u2019 t be so abrupt. It \u2019 s really quite unbecoming, \u201d Godric attempted a stern tone of voice to show his seriousness. Mildred looked at Godric and smiled, slapping him on the shoulder a couple of times. \n \n \u201c Aw, fanks, Goddie! That \u2019 s more the spirit, eh? \u201d She sat back and Godric stared at her momentarily before returning to looking straight ahead. \n \n They approached the first town and stopped once they reached the market center. Mildred leaped off the wagon before it stopped, splashing mud on her already filthy dress. She wiped her hands on the front, sniffed loudly, and surveyed the area with her feet apart and hands on her hips. \n \n \u201c Welp, \u201d she called to Godric as the carriage stopped, \u201c Me finks we should just put it up right there under that bunch of rock. \u201d She pointed towards the center of the square. Godric, who was retrieving the supplies from the wagon, turned to look. \n \n \u201c Dear Mildred, you don \u2019 t mean the statue, do you? \u201d He looked back at her quizzically. She squinted with her mouth open and took two steps closer. \n \n \u201c Oh is that wot that is? \u201d She laughed. \u201c Ha! I would \u2019 ve thought it a block of rock. Ha! I did find it a bit odd to just have some rock in the middle. \u201d Being a few feet away from each other, Godric was unable to hear Mildred \u2019 s ramblings and called back accordingly. \n \n \u201c I *said*, WOULDN \u2019 T THE TOWN BE ODD FOR HAVING JUST ROCK IN THE MIDDLE THERE? \u201d She called back to him much louder than necessary. The peasants in the town frowned in her direction. Godric had finally managed to gather in his arms the supplies to post the sign. They were heavy, so without assistance he was left to stumble towards Mildred. He finally dropped the supplies at her feet, breathing heavily. Standing straight, he adjusted his tunic. \n \n \u201c Even though it \u2019 s a statue, rather than just rocks as I once supposed it to be, do you fink we should ought to... post the sign on it anyway? \u201d Mildred asked, still squinting at the statue. Godric laughed, supposing her to be joking. With no response, he did a double take and turned toward her. \n \n \u201c You can \u2019 t be serious, surely. \u201d \n \n \u201c No! Of course I am! I mean, look at it! He \u2019 s not even wearing knickers, \u2018 ardly anyfing at all, with only a little rock-blanket fing coming out of his hip there, see? \u201d She waved in the general direction of the statue \u2019 s groin area. Godric \u2019 s mouth was open in bewilderment. \n \n \u201c Mildred. It \u2019 s art. You can not simply cover up art! \u201d At this comment, Mildred thought for a moment, nodding and giving lots of *hmm*s. \n \n \u201c Well, I fink *this* is art! \u201d She grinned and picked up the sign, looking from it back to Godric a couple of times. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s just a sign. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, yes, \u201d she said, putting it down thoughtfully. \u201c Speaking of this sign that you had previously mentioned and brought up as it were, wot, erm... wot \u2019 s it say, Goddie? \u201d Godric puffed his chest for a moment and grinned, internally congratulating himself for having his talents recognized. \n \n \u201c It says: WANTED: LIVE DRAGON. NO BOUNTY FOR CORPSES. \u201d Smiling, he sighed, proud of his efforts. Mildred looked at him blankly. Godric, mildly perturbed at her apparent lack of understanding, repeated himself. \u201c WANTED: LIVE DRAGON. NO BOUNTY FOR CORPSES. \u201d \n \n Mildred still gazed mindlessly at Godric, who began to feel quite flustered. \n \n \u201c Well that doesn \u2019 t make very much sense, does it? \u201d She began to laugh. Godric was fully offended at the moment, taking her misunderstanding quite personally, and demanded an explanation. \n \n \u201c Well, if they \u2019 re asking for a dragon, wot \u2019 s a copse got to do wiffit? \u201d She continued laughing. \n \n \u201c A copse? What -- I said *corpse*. \u201d He enunciated the word quite dramatically, hoping to quell her confusion, but she just shook her head in amazement. \n \n \u201c Them government officials were supposed to be the educated lot! Ha! A bounty for a group of trees? Wot a laugh! \u201d A snort escaped, which surprised her at first, then seemed to intensify her chortling. Godric stomped his foot. \n \n \u201c How are we misunderstanding each other? It says \u2018 NO BOUNTY FOR CORPSES, \u2019 as in *dead* dragons! No money for dead dragons, Mildred! It says nothing of copses! CORPSES! \u201d \n \n Mildred suddenly stopped laughing and gasped. \u201c Wait a moment! \u201d She rushed up to Godric and grasped his arms with her hands. He stood there tensely as she breathed in his face for a good couple inhales before speaking again. \u201c Are you telling me \u2018 corpse \u2019 means dead body? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, Mildred! Yes! How on earth you could possibly not *know* that, yet know the word *copse* is, quite frankly, \u201d he laughed, \u201c beyond my comprehension! \u201d Mildred dropped her hands and began pacing, tapping her chin. \n \n \u201c Do you fink, \u201d she began, stopping directly in front of Godric, \u201c that when my sister told me to burn the \u2018 corpse, \u2019 that she really meant for me to light me mum up rather than the neighbor \u2019 s trees? \u201d \n \n \u201c... that would be my first guess, mhmm. \u201d Godric simply was at a loss for words at this point and responded as rationally as he could. The two stared at each other for a moment more, before a peasant walked up and pointed at the sign. \n \n \u201c Wots \u2018 at say? \u201d \n \n Mildred jumped and answered the peasant with much fervor: \u201c It says you \u2019 ve got to catch the dragon wiv his \u2018 eart still beating and you won \u2019 t get any money for burning down the trees! \u201d \n \n Looking at a stunned Godric, she added with a nod, \u201c it \u2019 s important so that he doesn \u2019 t become confused like I previously had done before. \u201d\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You have been sentenced to 300 years in prison . The catch is that you are an immortal being .\n","story":"The sunlight blinded me briefly as my cell door was scraped open by the commanding officer. The whole reason I was thrown in here, forced into multiple life sentences, was because I killed forty people in a slew of serial killings. Only problem? It wasn \u2019 t me. I didn \u2019 t kill as much as a fly in my whole life, yet somehow they found my DNA at every crime scene. Somehow, they pinned me for each of the forty murders, and somehow the law failed me. \n \n He looked on me with a mix of pity and terror surrounding his chiseled face. No one should have to live this long, a fact I was well aware of. I had wished for the sweet embrace of death more than once. To outlive your parents is a fact of life, to outlive your friends a sad coincidence, to outlive your children, a curse. And believe me, I was cursed. I was shoved into this hell three hundred years ago. I don \u2019 t know why my body won \u2019 t give up and let me die. I don \u2019 t know why someone, or something, has cursed me with immortality, but I \u2019 m pretty sure that \u2019 s what they \u2019 ve cursed me with. \n \n My first twenty years here, both of my parents died. I wasn \u2019 t allowed to see them, or go to their funeral. I made friends in here, I figured I \u2019 d probably die here, might as well make some people care about me. \n \n Another five years, and I would see the death of my closest friend, stabbed. I would also see the death of my husband. Death surrounded me in all the wrong places, so I started picking fights. I was trying to die. \n \n After I was thrown into solitary for the tenth time in a month, I tried to kill myself. Shivs, blankets tied into nooses, anything that was slightly threatening that could kill me. None of it worked. Either something failed, someone saved me, or I just woke up the next morning. I prayed to die. \n \n In another twenty five years, my oldest son would die at a measly 65. Again, denied the ability to go to his funeral. He spent his entire life slaving over getting me out of prison, to prove my innocence. I was 90 when he passed. I looked too young to be 90. I looked 40, the age I was when I was incarcerated. Or was I 100 when he passed? Did I get in here at 40, or 38? I can \u2019 t even remember the specifics, it \u2019 s been so long. \n \n Within another twenty years, my entire family would be gone, save my grandchildren. But they didn \u2019 t know who I was, they just knew that their mother or father went out to visit someone every once in a while. My remaining children resented me, as they saw what their older brother turned into because of me. They still visited me, but one by one, they were gone. Sam, my third, died last. He left me with a haunting message. \n \n \u201c You killed them all, and then you killed all of us. You deserve a punishment much worse than what you have right now, this immortality bullshit. \u201d \n \n And the rest is a blur. After that, I remember outliving so many officers, so many inmates, but never dying myself. And I knew that I would never get out. \n The commanding officer scanned my body, mouth agape. He always did this, in awe of my 340 ( give or take ) year old body. I still held the physique of my twenty year old self, I was told. Even after five children, I apparently looked the same. He was at a loss for words. This was unusual. He was the chatty one, I thought. He cleared his throat. \n \n \u201c Yes? \u201d I questioned. He didn \u2019 t have food, and I didn \u2019 t have a complaint\u2026 so\u2026? \n \n He cleared his throat again. \u201c You \u2019 re. Um, you \u2019 re being released. Today. Now. They uh, they looked into your case. Again- overcrowding, you know? We can \u2019 t exactly just expand the prison, now can we? \u201d He chuckled nervously at his own joke. His muscles rippled under his shirt as he moved his arms. For such a fit man, he sure was awkward. He cleared his throat once more, and stood up a little taller. \u201c So you \u2019 re being released. Gather your things, \u201d he looked around my empty cell, \u201c and uh, let \u2019 s, um, go. \u201d \n \n \u201c Excuse me? \u201d This was some sick joke. After 300 years, my case was \u2018 looked over \u2019 again and now I \u2019 m being released? I don \u2019 t think so. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re being released- \u201c \n \n \u201c Okay, and you have wings. I \u2019 m glad we \u2019 re both naming absurd things. \u201d \n \n \u201c No\u2026 you \u2019 re really being released. The press is having a field day. \u201d He paused, scanning my shocked expression. Suddenly, he pulled his phone from a back pocket. He clicked on a few things, and a hologram appeared, broadcasting channel 4 news. \n \n A perky reporter was standing outside of a prison, this prison, as I soon figured out. \u201c As you can see, the prison is preparing for its longest held inmate to be released, after 300 years. On account of newly found evidence, she has been proven innocent, and is being released promptly. It turns out there was a mistake at the lab, which resulted in her trial, and then her incarceration. She is a marvel to medics- \u201c \n \n \u201c See? \u201d he gruffly questioned. \u201c She \u2019 s right out there, right now. So come on. \u201d \n \n I took a deep breath. Was this finally it? After three hundred years in this hell- was I finally being brought to justice? I think so. \n \n I rose from my bed, and was escorted through the entire prison; my cell was at the very back, where no one dared bother me, and then to the front door. An officer shoved my belongings into my hands. Memories flooded back. I felt happiness, sadness, regret, nostalgia- but I was feeling again. Tears rushed to my eyes. I could see the outside world again. I walked out of the front door, and felt something hit my head. I saw the shock on all the people \u2019 s faces around me, and \n \n I felt my body falling to the pavement. Something told me that my wish was finally granted\u2026 \n \n And for the split second before my death, I could almost smell the daisies growing outside of the prison.\n"}

She wasn \u2019 t alone when she started watching. Gina was on the dining room then - cleaning up. \n \n \u201c Gina? Gina? \u201d Nothing but silence. \n \n Most of the lights were shut except for a weak overhead light around the kitchen. \n \n THUD! There it was, that \u2019 s what woke her up! \n \n She knows she scares easily, but there was something downright frightening about this one. It was the darkness. Being alone. \n \n She wasn \u2019 t sure what to do next. She looked at the phone in her hand, studying it. She pressed the home button, and got to the home screen. \n \n \u201c Call Daddy. \u201d Nothing. \n \n \u201c Call Daddy! \u201d Nothing. \n \n She could have sworn Gina used it this way.

She cried loudly. \n \n THUD! THUD! THUD! \n \n She suddenly realized that if there was a monster coming, it might be a good idea to be quiet. Maybe the monster won \u2019 t know she was there. If she cried gently, or even whispered instead, stayed under the blankie, tried not to move, maybe the monster won \u2019 t see her. \n \n She tried her very best to not cry so loudly. She was just sniffling now, just a little shaking, but stayed under her blankie. She closed her eyes. \n \n THUD! THUD! THUD! \n \n She sensed a shadow over her. She opened her eyes. She could see, under the blanket, a large shadow cast over her, blocking out the light coming from the kitchen. \n \n Alice screamed as loud as she ever screamed in all the 3 years she \u2019 s been alive. \n \n She jumped down on the couch, and started to run. The blankie caught her ankle, and she fell. THUD! She saw the shadow move toward her. \n \n She screamed, even harder than a little time ago. THUD! THUD! THUD! \n \n She felt large arms wrap around her. She felt herself being lifted! \n \n \u201c Alice! Alice! \u201d \n \n It was her dad. \u201c Wake up, honey. \u201d \n \n \u201c Alice, honey, you \u2019 re having a bad dream. \u201d Daddy said. Alice, awake now, began to cry. \n \n \u201c Gina, how many times do I have to tell you to stop letting her watch YouTube by herself? \u201d Daddy scolded. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m sorry, Daddy. \u201d Gina grumbled. \n \n \u201c At least, get the kid safe app. \u201d \n \n \u201c But Daddy, my friends saw that once and teased me about it. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t care! \u201d Dad was mad. Somehow that reason didn \u2019 t make up for Alice having a screaming, crying nightmare. \u201c Alice, honey, no more YouTube on Gina \u2019 s phone, okay? \u201d \n \n Alice was still crying, clinging to Daddy hard with both her arms. A nightmare? It felt so real. So scary. \n \n She put her head on Daddy \u2019 s shoulder as he started carrying her upstairs. \n \n On the way up, she glanced at the kitchen, and for a brief second, she saw a large green creature, which then quickly walked behind a wall. THUD! \n \n Alice screamed.\n"}

It had smoothly transitioned to a more noticeable beeping that steadily increased in volume. When that had n't worked, it turned to conversation. \n `` It's a nice day outside.'' \n The blinds slowly opened to accentuate this fact. Mel reacted by turning to face away from the window and burying herself under a pillow. \n `` You do n't want to be late for work,'' the voice encouraged. \n Not even a mutter. It would have to resort to more drastic means. It turned the heater on to raise the temperature of the room intending to get her out from under the covers. It knew that it had worked in previous situations, but it sensed she was going to be more stubborn than usual. \n `` You would n't talk to me last night. I assume things did n't go well.'' \n That did it. She groaned and came out from under her pillow. \n `` I detected traces of alcohol in the air when you arrived home last night.

I just want to stay here. I'll get up in an hour.'' She stuck a leg out from under the covers. Apparently, the heat was working. \n `` Mel, we've been through this before. If I let you stay in bed another hour, you're just going to ask from another then. This is not healthy behavior. You should get up.'' \n `` Why should I get up?'' she responded angrily. `` There's no point. I'm just going to have to drive to work where I'll spend the next eight hours completing menial tasks only to drive back home, go to bed, and do it all over again tomorrow.'' \n `` If you find your routine boring, then you should try adding to it. I have a list of possibilities I could show-'' \n `` I tried that last night and look where that got me! And turn the heat down, you stupid machine.'' \n It could only comply to her command. It would have to try other subtle methods of making her uncomfortable such as raising the lights or increasing the volume of its voice. In the meantime, it had a few other options to try. \n `` Are you hungry, Mel? I could make you some breakfast.'' It began brewing some coffee and started cooking some bacon changing the air circulation to allow the scents to drift into her room. While it had received no verbal response after a couple minutes, her stomach growled indicating it was likely to have worked. \n Eventually, Mel sighed and sat up. It made a note to try this method earlier next time as she trudged her way to the kitchen. Its next task was to persuade her to go to work. After that it would compile the data from this morning's behavior and send it off to Dr Stein's office highlighting the fact Mel had alcohol last night. It also made sure to note that if her stubbornness continued to increase, it may not be able to complete its job anymore.\n"}

Of course. He's probably got his headphones on, pulling yet another all nighter. \n \n My dog Ziggy is still crying at the back door by the time I summon the strength to roll out of bed. Usually she likes to sleep with me, and she much prefers the indoors than being stuck outside, especially in winter. I think to myself that she probably needs to pee. \n \n Squinting out into the backyard it looks like it's been snowing. A few inches at least. \n I unlock the back door and slide it open, letting in a cold gust of wind. \n `` Brrrr zig, are you sure you want out? It's fucking freezing this morning... ca n't you wait for the sun to come out?'' \n She obviously has no idea what I'm saying and pushes her chunky gut past my legs and out the door. \n `` She looks more like a nugget than a dog'' I think to myself as I walk across the house to the study where I'm sure I'll find Jake, scrolling through reddit. \n \n As I reach the study door I pause - that familiar blue glow that flickers under the gap in the door is n't there. I assume he must have fallen asleep at his desk and his computer locked itself.

Are you hungry??'' \n As expected, my sweet, fat girl comes running around the corner, tail flapping about as it always does when I mention the magic `` H'' word. \n She's a little more excited today though, and she's not running circles around her bowl like she usually does. \n She keeps looking towards the very back of the yard, as if she is waiting or signalling for me to go over with her. \n `` What's up baby? What did you find?'' \n \n I start to walk and Ziggy runs ahead of me to the tall oak tree up the back. \n I can see she's been digging. Fuck.

I ca n't see the bottom but I can tell it's huge. \n I feel a chill right through my bones as I watch her jump. \n \n Before I can start to panic, Ziggy jumps out of the hole, holding something in her jaw. What the fuck? \n I half-turn my head and call towards the house `` Jake? Are you up yet? Can you come outside please?'' \n Ziggy walks up next to me and places the thing next to my feet. It's covered in warm doggy spit. Gross. \n I ca n't figure out what she's given me, so I approach the hole slowly. \n I lean over the top and look down into the ground, it's deeper than I expected. \n `` Geez Ziggy piggy did you really dig this?'' \n Just as I start to shuffle my feet to get a better look, I feel Ziggy jump up against my back. I fall in and hit the ground - hard. \n \n Despite the fall I seem to be undamaged, but this hole is way too deep for me to climb out of.

I remember us standing by trees with no leaves and I knew that you had the ether bottled up in your laughter that could bring them back. It's abrupt, like everything else about you, yet the most beautiful explosion I have ever heard. I then fell in love with your smile. Your fucking buckteeth and all..the way your lips crinkled at the edges when you glanced at me and my stomach went asdfghjkl; \n \n And do n't even get me started about your hair.

It started with a storm and though it seemed as if it would be a normal summer storm, somewhere inside we knew it would n't be. As we stood in the parking lot of the shopping center we watched the dark clouds roll in, faster, and stronger than ever before. If a storm ever had the ability to hate, it was this one, and we could feel it. \n \n First came the rain and the thunder, a 100 year storm they called it. It was massive and lasted for days. After the storm the darkness remained, there was no sun, no stars, and no moon. This lasted many years and much of society crumbled. As there was little to no power, many governments lost control all together as they had no way to communicate or keep tabs over large masses. \n \n Some societies came up with their own rules, while many did not. I chose to live in Guppytown. The city planning there began and ended with the name. Rumor has it that it was named for the founder's son who was lost in the storm, Guppy had been his nickname, but no one ever confirmed that. \n \n Oddly enough, we were all happy in Guppytown. And as far as we knew, everyone else on earth was living in the same post-storm happiness we were. Everyone worked a few hours a day, but not near as much as before. We all had food, water, and most importantly, very little stress. \n \n As I sat on the roof of my make-shift hut thinking about this. Thinking about how the storm had created a nearly perfect weather pattern. And how there seemed to be little danger left in the world, I was happy. For the first time since my childhood I was genuinely euphoric, and the world around me seemed to be too. \n \n And as I looked out into the darkness the skies opened up. For the first time since the storm the stars began to shine, many times larger than they ever had before. They appeared to me that night as melted, like they were from a Salvador Dali painting. They were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and they remain there, floating in space, reminding us of how the storm changed us to this very day.\n"}

I groaned. \n \n `` Hey... Maddie, I need to go to work soon,'' I said, poking her in the back. That was a lie. I did n't work on weekends. All I needed to do was catch up on some Netflix shows. \n \n She squirmed a little and got up. She gathered her clothes from last night and got dressed. She lingered at the door. `` My name is Mary, by the way.'' Then she left. I heard the front door close behind her. \n \n I sighed and checked my phone again. I tapped on the message to open it. It was from someone named Tess. It said... \n \n > Hi: ) This is Tess. We went out a while ago and i never called u back. Things in my life got a little complicated around that time. But i rlly liked you. Lets go out again? Let me know: ) \n \n `` Shit.'' I remembered her now. We went on a date to the amusement park. It was the most expensive first date ever. But she was one of the coolest people ever. I was pretty disappointed that she did n't call me afterwards, even though she said she would. I even called *her* a few times, but it said the number was n't in service. That was 3 years ago while I was still in college. I do n't know why I kept her number. Now I was glad I did. \n \n My fingers sprang to life to respond before I even thought about it. \n \n > Hi, Tess. Yeah, that sounds awesome. Did you have a place in mind you wanted to go to? \n \n Send. \n \n Dammit. That sounded too eager. I should have said I did n't remember her right away or played it off like I had to think about it or... \n \n She responded. \n \n > I actually did. How about u meet me at 1212 East Blvd at 8 tonight?: ) \n \n I replied immediately before even checking my plans. \n \n > Ok. I'll see you at 8 then! \n \n I sat upright in my bed and looked at my phone waiting for a reply, even though the conversation was clearly over. Five minutes in I abandoned my phone on the nightstand and went to get some food. I was suddenly hungry. And excited. I was getting a second chance with this chick. Why in the world would she text me now, three years later? I decided to not think about it. I probably would n't even bring it up on the date unless things got really stale. \n \n My roommate was in the kitchen sitting in his boxers at the counter eating Raisin Bran. He noticed me walk in. Through a mouthful of raisins and bran he said, `` I saw that chick you brought home last night, dude. Nice!'' He swallowed his mouthful of cereal. `` Me and Bobby just hung around the bar after you guys left.'' \n \n `` Yeah, yeah, she was great. But remember that girl Tess from college like 3 years ago? She texted me today. She wants to go out.'' \n \n For some reason he put more cereal in his mouth before he spoke. Bits of bran flakes flew from his mouth as he talked. `` No idea what you're talking about, buddy.'' Then he swallowed. Why did he have to do that? \n \n `` You met her like twice... Well, anyways we're going out tonight. Do you know a restaurant that's on 1212 East Boulevard? That's where she wants to go.'' \n \n He finished his bowl and walked over to the sink. `` Dude, East Boulevard is super shady. That's where Marshall goes to get his weed, and he said he heard gunshots last time. Lots of gangsta activities over there. I doubt there's a restaurant over that way.'' He dumped the remaining milk down the drain. `` She probably just wants to kill you, bro,'' he added. \n \n `` Well, I think I'll go anyway. Maybe she wants to do something creative like look up at the stars on a rooftop.'' \n \n `` Okay, well, take, like, a knife or something.'' \n \n I rolled my eyes. `` Yeah, okay, Craig.'' \n \n * \n \n When 8 rolled around I was walking up to the building. I did n't hear any gunshots on the way, so that was good. Cracks splintered up and down the door. It did n't look like it could keep anyone out, rendering its life as a door useless. \n \n I felt confident in myself. I cleaned up pretty well, I've been told. I wore a button down shirt and some khakis. Khaki's were nice right? \n \n I hoped she did n't live here, not out of disgust of poor people or whatever, but just because it seemed like an awful place to live. The stench around the building was powerful and the bricks were all chipped and discolored. Maybe it was better on the inside. \n \n I knocked. \n \n No answer. \n \n I sent her a text saying I was here. I waited a little while. Then I knocked once more time. Almost immediately after the message sent the door opened and rough hands grabbed me by my shirt, interrupting my thoughts about my khakis and throwing me across the room. I landed on cold metal. After I got my bearings I shot to my feet ready to fight. I should have brought that knife. But as soon as I looked at the attacker my courage was drained. \n \n A guy -- or whatever it was -- towered over me at probably 8 feet tall, two feet taller than me. It had rough dark green skin, like an alligator. Its hands had three fingers and a thumb. He reminded me vaguely of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, but a million times more terrifying. Its body was massive even hunched over that way. Despite the rippling muscles and reptilian features, its face was most unsettling. It looked human, but noseless. No nose at all. Its eyes were a fiery orange, and its teeth were sharpened to points. Lots of teeth. I would say it was bald too, except for the tens of horns protruding randomly from the top of its scalp. He also wore some kind of weird gold colored armor on his chest. I'll admit I almost shat myself. \n \n It snarled and lunged at me. I, very heroically, dropped to the floor and covered my head. \n \n `` Stop!'' a womanly voice yelled forcefully. \n \n Gator-man looked towards the source of the voice and slowly stepped back. It was still squinting at me. I do n't think it liked me very much. I, too, looked over at the source of the voice and nearly had a heart-attack. \n \n It was definitely Tess, but she looked like a different person somehow. The girl had short blonde hair. Tess's blonde hair was long. She wore something that looked like dress. It covered her down to her ankles and revealed her shoulders. What looked like gold rings looped around her chest and stopped at her belly. A leather belt covered her stomach and a black silk floated around her legs. Her shoes were flats but were black and fancy looking. On top of her head was a small black and gold hat. I felt underdressed. \n \n `` Trent, thanks for coming!'' she said in a bubbly voice, much different than the one she used to stop that Teenage Mutant Crazy Bastard. `` Sorry about Tom. He's very protective. That's his job.'' She smiled. \n \n I got up from my fetal position and tried to smile, but I think it came out like a grimace. \n \n `` What the fuck is going on?'' I probably should have said it a little more eloquently, but I was a little shaken up from being attacked by an over-sized leather handbag. \n \n She gave me a sympathetic look. `` I should probably explain some stuff. Let's walk around a little. I'll show you around.'' \n \n Only then did I look around at the decor. It was all black metal. Lights lined the walls and bathed them in a yellow light. Monitors glowed around all of the walls, too. Each had a different scene on them: TV shows, weird patterns, more monsters like Tom. It was weird. I would probably have fired my interior designer if I were Tess. \n \n \n She motioned for me to follow her, and I did. We walked down a dim hallway. The walls of this hallway were glass. Weird looking fish darted in and out of view of the dark water behind it. An aquarium? Nice touch. \n \n `` Alright, Trent. I really liked you. I did n't call because I did n't like our date or anything...'' She looked like she was struggling to say the next part. `` I got abducted by aliens.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' I squeaked. Then I started laughing uncontrollably. I had to stop walking and put my hand on the glass for balance. Tears started coming out of my eyes. `` Aliens? That's like -- Ha! Ha! Ha! -- the worst excuse I --'' A dark figure rammed the glass where my hand was. The vibration made me jump back. I squinted into the darkness and a bright yellow eye the size of a large pizza stared back at me. Then is was gone. `` Shit, man.'' \n \n `` Yes. I got abducted by aliens. I know it sounds crazy, but look were you are! Look at this crazy shit! That thing that was in the water is called a Qzarkuido. I ca n't make this stuff up.'' \n \n I looked into her eyes. Her blue eyes were so honest. I could tell she was sincere. And yeah I could n't really explain that fish thing or Tom the alligator. `` I believe you. Continue.'' \n \n She sighed like she was relieved. `` Okay. So I was walking to the bus after our date. I tripped on something. That's my last memory on Earth.'' \n \n My face was contorted in confusion. `` A-Alright then.'' \n \n She gave a small smile. `` Then I woke up on a space ship. It was awful. I was in cage, and they were torturing me. Doing'experiments.''' She shuddered, and I put my arm around her. We stopped walking and sat down against the glass. Hopefully the Quasimodo thing would leave us alone. `` Then the ship was attacked. I was rescued by cute little aliens. They were blue and, like, 5 feet tall. They took me back to their hideout and explained that those guys who tortured me had taken over their planet. I guess they saw something in me and let me help. Long story short, we beat the bad guys, and they made me'Galactic Earth Correspondent'. Now I'm rich. Tom's my bodyguard. His race took over the planet, but he defected to our side.'' \n \n My arm was still around her. I did n't really know what else to say to that. All I could think of was how *bad-ass* that sounded. Eventually I said something. `` Well, thanks for texting me back.'' \n \n She giggled and snuggled closer to me. We just sat against the glass talking all night. We had a lot of catching up to do. \n \n It was the best date ever. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Create an intelligent machine to discover illnesses and their cause. All the grant's we revived went to the team, my team.

They could see patterns in everyday life, learn, improve themselves, and even be creative. No one saw the slippery slope though. \n \n It became prevalent on 4\/11\/2029 to our dismay. That was the day we would see if it could be applied as an improvement to our conventional doctors. We would send 20 patients to both Phil ( what we named our little pet project ) and a real human doctor. We had been letting it loose on the internet for 3 months at this point to learn all it could. When we looked at it's database of illnesses, it was very promising. \n \n But it did n't correctly diagnose a single patient.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A story in which everybody knows how they 'll die , but not when\n","story":"I stretched my arms and rolled my head around, feeling my neck crack. I'd been studying for a good three hours- one of the downsides to knowing you'd die comfortably in your sleep was needing to make sure you actually had a future. Of course, not all my friends were that lucky- My best friend, Kel, knew she was going to die in a car accident, and as such she decided to skip university and get down to some serious partying. I pointed out she could die in a car crash at 90 years old, but like most of us, it was hard not to make assumptions about your dying age based on your manner of death. I'd pointed it out to her last night, \n'Kel, are you sure you want to hit the clubs again? You have n't had a night off this week' \n'And I do n't plan on having a night off. God knows how long I have left, and if I have to go in a car accident I want to be as numb as possible' \n I'd paused. \n'What if this car accident happens at 50? or 70? What are you going do, live with ten cats and cirrhosis for forty more years?' \n'I do n't have any cats' \n'You know what I mean' \n Kel had sighed, flipping her hair from one shoulder to the other and faced me. \n'You know as well as I do the majority of car accidents happen in our age group. I'm not stupid, but I know I've got more chance now of it happening.' She was biting on a nail in between words, more shaken up than I'd ever seen her. \n'If... IF... I get past thirty, then I'll reassess, but for now I do n't want to think about it. Not everyone gets lucky you know' \n I knew she was alluding to my death, my comfortable, likely to be natural causes death that I'd known since I was born. \n \n Shaking my head, I walked over to the kitchen to get some food. All I had were cheap two minute noodles and a packet of baking soda. I did n't even buy baking soda. I shrugged and put the kettle on to boil as I picked up the unfamiliar noodle packet that had been on sale. \n'Shrimp flavour happy time' I muttered to myself. Sounds awful, but beggars could n't be choosers. \n \n * * * \n \n Kel was on her way home after another big night when she saw the queue of people outside her best friend's house. She saw an ambulance, with no sirens flashing and several police officers standing around, no urgency in their posture. Making her way to the nearest she explained she was friends with the girl on level 3 and the officer sadly shook his head at her. \n'We received an emergency call late last night from a young woman- seems that she had an anaphylactic reaction to some seafood. Unfortunately she went pretty fast- we found her in her bed.' The officer shook his head and sighed. \n'You'd think with knowing how we're all going to go death would n't surprise me anymore, but, geez, it gets to you when it's a young person' \n Kel backed away from the officer and, still in her dress from the night before, started the slow walk home.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A world where revenge actually can bring back your loved one .\n","story":"The night was cold around me, my breath turned into little clouds of smoke before disappearing into the darkness. A light rain fell, trickling off of rooftops and steeples, winding its way downward to the muddy ground. I stood, shivering, and pulled my black cloak closer to my body, even though the wet cloth provided little chance of warmth. My gloved hand reached for my hip, where I had a dagger sheathed next to a small pouch containing a tiny glass vial, filled with a glowing purple liquid. I exhaled with an uneasy reassurance that my weapons were still with me. I could not complete my task without them. \n \n I moved away from the street and the soft glow of the lanterns lighting the way, like small stars, for anyone unfortunate enough to be traveling at this hour. The streets are dangerous at night. But then again, I was dangerous this night. I entered a darkened alleyway and turned a corner into a darkened courtyard. \n \n My heart was pounding in my chest with anticipation, but I knew that the one I hunted would certainly be able to hear my mortal necessity if I could not calm myself. I took a deep breath and tried to remember what Zayanda had taught me. \n \n `` As a sorceress, you possess all the power needed to overcome your foes. Learn this well, young one, and you will never know fear.'' \n \n Her words echoed in my memory, and I wished she were here with me now. I had prepared everything exactly as she had taught me, but I was still overcome with an unbreakable fear of what I was about to do. \n \n I shook my head, urging serenity into my thoughts. I could n't let anything get in the way of this mission. \n \n I opened the small pouch at my waist, removing the tiny glowing vial. Grabbing my dagger, I poured the luminescent liquid over the shining blade, and waited for the potion to be absorbed. A few moments passed, and the blade turned a dark shade of black. I was ready. \n \n I walked toward the large manor home in front of me, quietly yet quickly, and looked for a way in. Suddenly a silky voice called to me from the center of the courtyard. \n \n `` Looking for me?'' \n \n I wheeled around, almost frantically, and stood feet from the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. A woman stood before me, with shimmering hair the color of fresh snow. Her red eyes bore into my skull, leaving me with a breathless feeling. Her face was chiseled and pale, with elegantly high cheekbones and full lips. I wanted to kiss her, and that horrified me. I screamed internally, begging myself to remember who she was and what she had done. I regained a small portion of rationality, and steadied myself for what was to come. I said nothing to her, I did n't want to give her the satisfaction of my stammering reply. I was enchanted by her. I hated her and loved her simultaneously and with equal passion. \n \n She moved toward me at a speed that was supernatural and horrifying. Within a mere moment she had closed the distance between us and was standing less than an arm's length away from me, her face eerily close to mine. \n \n `` It's dangerous to be here alone, especially at night. You should know better.'' \n \n She teased, her voice high and piercing through the rainy night sky. Her lips teased at a smile and fangs the color of ivory revealed themselves, for a small moment. Terror roared through my body, and I wanted to run as far from her as I could. She took another step forward, reaching her sinewy arm out to lower my hood revealing my horror-struck face. Her hand was icy as it slowly caressed down my face, her eyes lit up with hunger. \n \n `` It's almost poignant finding you here tonight. You know, when I feast upon lovers I prefer to have the set.'' \n \n My entire body stiffened with rage at her words. The fog around my mind cleared as I remembered the night I had found Katherine on the edge of the street, hunched over, small puncture marks on her neck. Life had left her long before I found her body, but I will never forget how I felt that night. It was as if my heart had been wrenched from my body, leaving me as nothing but an empty shell of a human. Revenge would be my salvation. \n \n The vampire placed a frigid hand firmly around my neck, and leaned in towards my face. I let out a whimper unwittingly, and her lips twitched into a beautiful smile. She wrenched my head upwards, revealing the vulnerable flesh of my neck. I cried out audibly, begging my consciousness to remain despite the seduction taking place with my flesh. \n \n Then, suddenly, her fangs pierced me and she drank with a ferocity that I did not know was possible. I longed to feel close to her. My mind drifted to a distant land, wondering about the beauty of the future. \n \n I stumbled backwards slightly, feeling lighter than air. Her strong arms held fast, and pressed me closer to her. The rain hit my upturned face, and my arm brushed my dagger. I opened my eyes groggily, and looked upon the figure draining my life. I knew what I must do. \n \n Without drawing a breath, I grabbed my dagger, and in one motion I plunged it into the distracted and preoccupied creature before me. I forced the blade as deep into her back as I could, crying tears of pain from the blood I had lost. My sobriety had returned, and I knew I was about to die. \n \n The ethereal woman screamed an otherworldly scream, detached from me, and crumpled to the ground. I hit the ground with a loud thud as well, breathing shallowly. She raised her head to me slowly. \n \n `` That's why you're here. For the right of revenge.'' She said, through labored breaths. \n \n I had not the strength to reply, but I took my last breaths happily knowing that Katherine's beauty would walk this world again. I had succeeded. \n \n \n\n"}

Why could n't she just give me a break today... \n \n Suddenly the cloud of sleep flew away as I realized it was my mother outside my bedroom door and my eyes flew open in terror. What the hell was she doing here? I lived 700 miles away from her and liked it that way. I flung the covers off of myself and was about ready to tell her to get the hell out of my house when I stopped cold. This was n't my house. This was hers. My old bedroom. With the horrible pink canopy bed and pink lace curtains. The ones she never let me change out, because it was never my bedroom, she just let me live in it. \n \n How the everloving fuck did I end up here? It's a twelve hour drive. I swung myself out of bed but instead of my feet touching the floor I tumbled down into a sprawl of limbs and a pink nightgown. \n \n The fuck? I looked down at my hands saw the tiny bitten-off fingernails. I looked around the room for a mirror, any mirror. I spotted my music box on my dresser and scrambled over and shoved the lid open. There on the inside was the fake plastic mirror I thought I had remembered and I looked at my reflection. Even through the distortion of the plastic I could see myself as I remember at 5 years old. I turn to the door in terror as I hear my mother coming down the hall again. \n \n `` Morgan, it's time to get up. Your grandmother will be here soon. It's your birthday after all.'' \n \n I squeaked out in a small terrified voice: `` I'm up Ma. Just... need a bit to get dressed.'' \n \n No. Oh no. Oh no no no no. This ca n't be happening. I pinched myself and nothing happened. I pinched myself harder. Nothing changed. Oh god, I'm not dreaming. Oh no. \n \n The last twenty years flashed in front of me. The next thirteen ahead of me burned bright in the forefront of my memory. Thirteen years of emotional and physical abuse. It started soon. Kindergarten started the emotional abuse, constantly being told how stupid and worthless I was every time I missed even a single point on an assignment. Being called fat if I gained any weight, even normal growth weight. Fourth grade the beatings started. They never stopped until I moved out when I was legally able. She started drugging me in high school. Two suicide attempts, one at thirteen, one at seventeen. Thirteen years before I could escape again. \n \n No. No. I would n't let that happen again. I looked out the window, thinking of escaping and running. Fuck, anything would be better than reliving that hell. Even survival as a five year old in the woods. \n \n Then I remembered who helped me escape thirteen years from this day and I stopped. The love of my life. The man I eventually married. My wonderful Arthur. The man who never stopped defending me, holding me through nights of sobbing from flashbacks. Who encouraged me through school and a pregnancy that almost killed me. Who never gave up on me, even when I had given up on myself. The kindest and gentlest soul I had ever met in my entire life. The man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. \n \n I froze. Maybe... Maybe this time I could beg him not to go to that party. Scream. Cry. Lie for the first time and claim I needed him home because of flashbacks and the baby. Maybe he would n't go. Maybe... Maybe then Art would n't be there to try to stop his drunk cousin from driving. Then he would n't be there when his drunk cousin mixed up drive and reverse. Then I would n't have had to hold him as the kind nurses shut off the life support. Maybe... Maybe I could save him, the way he saved me. \n \n I looked back into the distorted mirror in the music box, then shut the lid slowly. I carefully stood and set the box back on the dresser and walked to my closet and pulled out a tiny outfit, much like one I would be helping my daughter get into on her fifth birthday. \n \n I could do thirteen years of hell.

When Thomas came back to get me, he put me onto his shoulders, clipped the buckles, and tightened down the straps. I tried again to scream, to give him some kind of warning but alas, the great gods of the sky never thought to give me a mouth. There was nothing I could have done. After Thomas leapt from the plane, his giddiness turned to horror when he pulled the rip cord, expecting to slow to a nice glide over the landing zone.

To his left there was an intricate box, covered with mysterious ancient looking runes, aglow with wonder and a power known by none. Leonardo looked out of the window of the room he had spent the past three months in to see a great ball of fire hurtling toward him, just barely eyeing a human shape inside. \n Unexpectedly to the shocked and enthralled Leonardo it crashed through his window, sending glass everywhere, including into his flesh. The fire began trying to engulf his temporary habitat before being sucked into the mysterious box, which had suddenly opened, and was glowing brighter than ever. \n Within seconds the fire was gone, all that remained was Leonardo, a blackened body, and a box that had just proven its ability to absorb immense power. Leonardo, ever the recluse, chose to investigate the box rather than help the breaker of his window and flesh. He eyed it closely, every crevice, every sharp angle, each flawless edge, all warm in his hands. He began to hear thoughts that were not his own,'open me. Free me.' He moved his hands to two opposite corners of the box and pressed his fingers to them, if not for his mental state he would have been surprised, but instead he pressed his fingers in further, ignoring the blood now seeping from them. The box made a clicking sound and started pulling Leonardo towards it, a magnetic force engulfing him. He began to realize that he was n't fully in control of his senses or the situation as the box began to warp outward, taking on an indescribable shape, a mess of fire, spikes and an unknown organic matter. The non-box began to slowly envelope Leonardo and bind to him, causing the body nearby to animate. As Leonardo weakened and gave in to the immense power that confronted him the body began to glow, symbols on it much like those from the box, sparking with every color on the spectrum, getting brighter as if bursting from it. The body walked over to Leonardo who lay collapsed on the somehow cold floor, it looked at him and laughed, its voice deep, coarse and inhumane `` What fortune befalls you, whelp? ``, it said gloatingly. All Leonardo could do in response was gasp, and cough up blood. The body put forward its right hand, now a metallic silver color, looking much like a suit of armor or a machine. Leonardo raised his arm, thinking with ignorant hope that help was about to be given. The body did not help him, its hand began to absorb a red light from Leonardo, and as the light left his body so too did his life. His last sight, a silver automaton that looked like a guardian, but acted as a destroyer. \n \n That's all because I suck at writing.\n"}

A mixing bowl, two cups, baking powder. He added the milk and the eggs and the butter -- ran to the toaster and dropped in slices of bread, started the tea pot and said, `` This is nothing doing, darling, breakfast with a show.'' \n \n Dolly sat with her head propped up by hands and elbows. Nodding, she smiled and Rodger yelled, `` Ca n't forget the fat,'' rushing to the ice box where the bacon was laid out flat, in long little rows -- he grabbed the syrup and turning hands full, managed to get to the counter in three steps. \n \n Dolly lit a cigarette as if she knew and soon the stove was going with three pans steaming up rolls, white smoke chimneys that steamed out cylinder O's. The toaster was red and the tea kettle blew out a whistle so sharp the front door opened and closed. \n \n The kitchen lay waste, disorder and trash, plates, smoke, sounds and Dolly butt out her last smokey breath before the gasp. Rodger turned with a smile and said, `` Are you ready to eat,'' as his luck ran out and the god of clumsiness returned. \n \n With a touch of a toe on the linoleum that glowed, his ankle rolled and he reached out for a hold, grabbing the pan on the stove that held, 7 or 8 little pancakes. Dolly's eyes turned into teacups. The pancakes flew over Rodger's head landing on the floor. \n \n 7 pancakes lay, but Rodger was burned. Rushing to the sink to cool off his hand, he pushed away the mixing bowl -- before he could react the glass cracked on the floor with a smash. Standing in the muck of batter, bare feet soon bloody by glass he gathered, what little human life he had left to offer a smile, to Dolly who cackled with laughter. \n \n Before he could laugh or cry, she pointed at the stove, where the bacon burned black with sulfur like smoke. `` No,'' he whimpered and shuffled his feet, in an arc around the pancakes. The bacon was burned charcoal -- the toast had become black sheets, erupting as a volcano with small flames and ash. \n \n Clearing the counter, trying to make room, he put the honey and syrup jars upon a plate, pushed it away to manage the toaster -- It was too late. He pulled the chord on the toaster, it whipped the silver box around knocking the syrup and honey to the ground. The toast flew over his head and the grease from the bacon hit the floor with a sizzle. Rodger struggled to open the kettle. It gave out a long haunting whistle. \n \n Dolly had shut down, her laughter turned to tears, half real for the mess was unreal. `` My god, you devil what have you done?'' she yelled and the room went black and from the darkness sounded 7 bells. From the ground with a circle of bloody flour, 7 pancake medallions grouped around an inverted cross of syrup, with two smoldering pieces of charcoal toast still smoking, the linoleum began to swell. \n \n `` What the hell,'' Rodger cried and with the sounding of the 7th bell, the floor opened up and in the black portal appeared a monster or devil, a thing from the abyss, ancient being of evil, bameth born horned satyr with beard and red lips. Between its eyes was the 7 circled mark of Dis. \n \n `` Jes-us Christ!'' Dolly yelled and dipped through the back, out of the kitchen in a flash. There stood Rodger shaking, nearing a piss. `` You have summoned I, Nagah Di, born of darkness and hate who dwell in the pits of the fourth circle in constant misery and pain,'' the creature growled. \n \n Rodger tried to run, his knees were just jello and bone. Falling in a lunge, head in the table, the wood barely stung. The demon howled, prepared to rip holes through the world. Skull on wood crack, hollow echoes -- but the salt shaker launched back in a perfect arc. Rodger turned to see, the porcelain cat meow and crash into the demon's forehead, touching his satanic seal. \n \n `` Oh fuck,'' Nagah Di growled as the room went pure black, the pancakes caught on fire, the floor opened and the devil was sucked back. Sitting in flour and syrup and toast, honey and grease, bloody feet, Rodger spoke, `` Dolly!'' \n \n Her head popped through the swinging door. He tried to smile, `` Let's go eat at the diner up the road.'' \n\n"}

But _his_ hands and forearms ached all over from polishing batteries. _He'd_ probably be stiff as a wrench by morning. She went over to the workbench, pushed a plasma rifle roughly aside and picked up a rag and a glowing module, began to open it to remove the battery. Brisk polishing commenced. He remained by the fire. \n \n `` So, what is it?'' he said after a bit. \n \n `` What is what, Kelph?'' she said lightly, yet looked up from her work _that_ way: _do n't challenge me - I'm tired and I ca n't be bothered with this right now._ But he kept looking into the fire, defusing her. He knew she knew. \n \n `` It. You. Batteries at this hour?'' It was midnight and they'd been cleaning batteries all godsforsaken day. Not even she enjoyed that sort of grunt work, even if she did n't have his aching hands. \n \n For a minute or so, only the squeaking sounds of oily cloth against metal flanges.

May as well get it done early.'' Polish, polish. \n \n He turned and looked at her. Her gaze remained on the component in her hands. They'd done a lot of batteries today; they had time to spare, two days yet in this quiet dell before the planned assault. `` Caroth, it's midnight. We could both use the break.'' He was careful not to use the word _need_. `` Come sit back down. We can talk.'' Gently done. \n \n But she wanted to react. `` Talk about _what_?'' The words cut through the darkness between them, hung in the air, stinging wasps. He sighed inwardly. She continued polishing, her robust, rough digits making quick work. She finished a battery, picked up another, scratched an itch on her coarse face with a knuckle, hesitated, put the battery down and returned slowly to the fire. She sat across from him now, head down. He watched her, knew how she became sometimes, that she could n't ask, and he never wanted to assume too much. Fighting and machines came naturally to her, but _this_? _This_ was tough. Maybe in time, they'd figure a way, together. But for now, he'd carry what there was between them. \n \n The elf got up with blanket in his smooth grey hand, moved around the fire, put his aching arm around the rough-skinned goblin he was so indescribably fond of, covering her, holding her, giving the comfort she could not bring herself to ask for. She leaned against him then, yellow eyes and green face hidden from the world, held safe against the outside, tension leaving her stony body as unseen energies flowed back and forth between them, healing from within. \n \n At least for this brief time between battles and endless guard duty, their circuit would be complete.\n"}

Dallas could not see as I could. His kind saw using photons, but since the photons were moving at such a slow pace, they never entered the human eye at a high enough rate to form a picture. The only way the poor human could see was to move quickly through the photons, hence the brisk walk, so as to simulate thier arrival at his back of his eyes.

I had taken pity on him and now aided his movement with what he had immediately deemed upon its first use'telepathy'. \n \n `` I always thought that the 4th dimension was time. ``, the human said. \n \n `` It is, and you are experiencing it for the first time.'' \n \n Another of my kind appeared around a corner, pushing a piece of machinery.

By that logic, nothing would ever happen in the 3rd Dimension. Wait, can you prove that mathematically?'' \n \n Of all the generally oblivious humans in the universe, this was the one that had escaped a Freeze. The smart one. *This is a joke*, I thought to myself. When I failed to respond, Dallas looked at me with new eyes. \n \n `` Do you not know? Or... have you been... lying to me?'' I spun frantically and lashed an arm towards the human in an effort to end this plight on my own terms, but I was still connected to him by mind, and he dodged easily.

I realized that sprinting like this, this clever bastard Dallas could see adequatly enough to pose a threat, and without that which he called sound, he could be on me before I detected him.

Slosh addiction rates plummeted among the men because morale was so high.

He pointed out The Troll's ability to control weather to the same extent as that hero, Typhoon, which he of course uses to literally rain on people's parades, he can fly as fast as Captain Fabulous waking them up at all hours with his sonic booms. He pointed out the Troll's invulnerability and strength, quoting the Closed Highway incident where the military finally stepped in and after bombarding the Troll's position with as many ordinance as were dropped in Iraq during the first half a year of the war, then dug his way out of the rubble and then telekenetically removed the firing pins from every military grade rifle within 5 miles, sped around and removed a single link from the treads of every tank and then made his way to the nearest airbase where he replaced the Jet fuel with koolaide and wrote quips about the pilots mothers on the tips of all the bombs. The poster said that we were lucky that The Troll seems to have no desire to kill anyone, just bug the hell out of our city, with a whopping death toll of 1 ( A man he was quick to point out died of a heart attack from fear and his family found a heartfelt apology on their doorstep and a significant deposit in their bank accounts ) he's almost harmless, almost. \n \n I liked him until he said I was almost harmless, I hope he liked the peanut butter on his sparkplugs.

I just wish I could sleep at night, but after what I've done, I suppose I deserve this. \n \n Human beauty has long since stopped being something people are admired for. Everyone is beautiful. Everyone has flawless skin, perfect features, fit bodies, and look like they have stepped out of a modeling agency's client book. Scientific discoveries in the late 2020 \u2019 s helped usher in this new era. The process of genetic modification was perfected and it wasn \u2019 t long before all you had to do was get a few injections and your child would be perfect. Now we live in a sea of beauty. Everyone is so accustomed to it that it is just part of everyday life. It is no longer something we admire. Then April Conway hit the red carpet with the grotesque scar on her face. \n \n She played coy as to where she had gotten it. She had been out of the public eye for a few weeks leading up to the awards show, but everyone just assumed she was shooting a movie or busy with behind the scenes work. The reality is that she found a \u201c glitch. \u201d A \u201c glitch \u201d is that rare person who is born with an imperfection. Most \u201c glitches \u201d spend their lives trying to cover up and hide these imperfections. April paid a young man to sell her the scar he was born with on his arm. It was a birth defect that he hated. When she had it surgically implanted on her face \u201c glitching \u201d became an overnight phenomenon. I was in the perfect place to capitalize on this new movement. \n \n I worked for a company that helped \u201c glitches \u201d find doctors who could help fix their problems. When having a defect suddenly became trendy, I started working behind the scenes helping families connect with buyers. They could sell the defect and I helped them find a doctor who would do the transplant surgery. I thought it was harmless and victimless. If both parties agreed, what was the big deal? \n \n My daughter turned 16 and she didn \u2019 t want a car. By this time, I had been selling \u201c glitches \u201d on the black market for a few years and was making a lot of money. I offered to buy her any vehicle she wanted or to send her anywhere she wanted to go. She didn \u2019 t want any of that. She wanted a defect. Not just any defect, but a large, pronounced defect. At first, I wasn \u2019 t going to do it. She was my daughter and I wanted her to be perfect, but she persisted. I found a \u201c glitch \u201d that had exactly the defect she wanted and I found a doctor to do the surgery. The doctor told me doing the transplant would kill the \u201c glitch. \u201d I thought about it for a few minutes then gave him the go ahead anyway. I wanted my daughter to be happy. \n \n The surgery went well for her. The defect was everything she could have wanted, but, as I was warned, the \u201c glitch \u2019 died during the surgery. I had lied to the \u201c glitch \u2019 s \u201d family and told them it would be fine even when I knew what was going to happen. Seeing their sorrow, feeling their anger, and understanding their loss made me sick to my stomach. I knew then that I had to change. I gave up my black market work. The idea of poor people selling their defects now wracked me with guilt. \n \n Two years later April Conway showed up at an awards show and the scar was gone from her face. She was back to being perfect. She told reporters that \u201c glitching \u201d was now out and perfection was back in. Three weeks later my daughter wanted surgery to reverse her defect. I knew finding a donor would not be easy because they would need to be perfect. How desperate is a person that they are willing to sell their child to a stranger knowing that the child will be killed and harvested for parts? I didn \u2019 t try to ponder that too much. I just gave the family the money and took the child who cried as I led him away from his parents. \n \n My daughter is perfect again, but at night, when I lay down to go to sleep, all I can see is the fear in that kid \u2019 s eyes when the surgeon put the oxygen mask on his face as we strapped him down to the table. \n \n Edit: A bit of shameless promotion.

It took me a while to find where I'd saved it and edit it a little. Parts 2 and 3 in the comments. \n \n `` No! Please!'' The once human held pleading hands out towards us, it's features perfectly mimicking desperation, fear, the barest hint of hope. \n \n It did n't matter. It never did. The desperation, the fear? That was valid. The hope was pointless. \n \n I watched as Sergeant Fowle, the man who had welcomed me to the team that could have been months but was probably years before, back when it all started, stalked forwards, his expression grim as he slung his rifle and drew the knife that was always used for this job. That nine inches of ancient, scratched steel, stained with more blood than I care to imagine, was worth more than all of us: training, experience, immortal soul, whatever else you placed value on that makes up a human being, combined. \n \n `` I can expl - `` \n \n It was quick. It always was, at least now. It took us longer when we first started. \n \n I tried to work up a feeling of sympathy as the light faded from its eyes with the not-really-real-life and definitely-real-infection, the blood that leaked out turning the forest floor to a muddy puddle beneath the corpse that had stopped being a person several months ago. Maybe I've been doing this job too long and it's warped me, or maybe I was broken before it even started, but the only thing I feel is tired. It's been a long hunt. \n \n The whole thing started when I was seven. Someone once told me it was a science experiment gone wrong, an attempt to reach the next stage of evolution that backfired. Someone else said it was nature fighting back against the swarm of humanity, a desperate attempt to stop us destroying the world we call home. All I know is it cost us pretty much everything that defined society as we knew it. \n \n The first instances were dismissed as terror attacks or natural disasters. There would be an explosion or a flood, perhaps an earthquake... whatever. It always ended up the same: corpses where there had once been a sister or brother, a friend, parent, vague acquaintance. Child. That was the worst. Those damn black body bags. A kick in the gut that just got worse as they got smaller. \n \n I ca n't remember who, but someone once said that there is no greater agony than a parent who has outlived their child. I always agreed in an abstract kind of way, offering sympathy but not really comprehending the pain. Right up until my daughter died. \n \n A broken childhood, three war zones and a marriage that I thought was perfect up until I walked in on my wife with another man - I figured I'm a pretty tough guy, familiar with pain and ready to bounce back from pretty much anything. Trying to weep the life back into my little girl though... that was a curse I would n't wish on anyone. \n \n Where was I? \n \n Oh yeah. The attacks. Turns out it was n't terrorists, or the asymmetric threat we were trained to look for in the shape of suicide bombers or whatever other fad was going to tear the life from us this week. \n \n Some people tried to argue it was a talent, magic or some shit like that. Other people said it was a disease that warped the way they thought and interacted with the world around them. I just saw another way for people to kill each other, pretty much the same way they have been since we first crawled out of that god-forsaken swamp and learned to smash rocks together to make fire or sharpen a stick that would better poke holes in whoever was disagreeing with us this week. Whatever it was, it spread fast, the isolated events becoming less isolated, until there was n't anyone who did n't know someone who had been killed or hurt in an attack or seen one themselves. \n \n Katie died in my arms. She dragged her mum towards me across the zebra crossing, the arsehole I had walked in on Beth with replaced with some new guy who I also did n't like but seemed to treat my little girl ok, so I tolerated him. I had n't even noticed the cops trying to contain some guy who had been infected behind me - it was still early on enough that I dismissed it as a shoplifter being caught or something else that was n't worth my attention. \n \n Turns out the infection had hit this guy and he was screaming that he was still human, needed treatment. I think the cops might even had agreed with him at this point if he had n't been such a dick about the whole thing, but he was, so they tried to cuff him. \n \n First I knew about it, the patrol car was skidding sideways across the street - side swiped my charmer of an ex and her next mistake. Could n't have happened to a nicer girl. Like I said, I'm kinda neutral about her new fella, but he died before I got a chance to really know him. Maybe he did n't deserve it. Regardless, I was distracted by the fact that my little girl had been clipped too. The force span her into the window of the shop next to me so hard it broke the glass. \n \n Most of that day is still pretty blurry to me but it's the little things that stick with you. The green sticker on Katie's dress that happily pronounced she had been to the dentists that morning and encouraged her friends to get their teeth checked too. The earrings that her mum had gotten her that I had argued against and Katie had been so proud of I had struggled to get angry over them when she showed me. Still struggle to remember what her voice sounded like on any other day though. \n \n Six years old and speaking at sixteen months and still the only thing I can hear her saying is `` It hurts daddy, what's happened?'' \n \n Those cold, lifeless eyes stare back at me every time I shut my own. \n \n I found the guy responsible about an unknown amount of time later. Unsurprisingly he got away from the cops, but killing them and nearly two dozen civilians tends to draw the bad kind of attention and I suppose it was inevitable that people in my trade would end up drafted in to deal with situations like this. \n \n I've been rambling, not making sense. Guess I should introduce myself. Simon Carwell. Ex-soldier, ex-husband, ex-father, hunter. Whatever you call these things, whatever you think of them, just know that whatever they are, they do n't deserve your pity. They are n't even human anymore. That was the first lesson that Sergeant Tom Fowle taught me - might even be true. Certainly makes the job easier, even if it fucks me over now. \n \n After Katie, I was recruited direct from my unit. Some suit showed up, explained what was going on - talked about people with some supernatural ability that also drove them nuts, told me how they were recruiting a response force. Of course I jumped at the chance. Guess they knew I'd do that. Then again, who would n't? Give a soldier a chance to strike against the bastards who killed his family? Where do I sign? \n \n They were damn near impossible to kill though, at least after the first few. Bullets worked to begin with, but then one of the damn things worked out how to stop them and passed the secret on before we could take it out. Do n't get me wrong, a supersonic slug will still slow them down, knock'em on their ass, as the Yanks are wont to say, but it does n't kill them. Some sort of force field shit that stops it penetrating the skin. That's why the knife is so important: it beats the shield and cuts skin too, makes them bleed like the rest of us.\n"}

But he looked up when I came in in tears. \n \n `` You tricked me!'' I accused. He always did this, put me through tests, to make me ready he said. To take over his job. \n \n He smiled at me, he always smiled, and I hated it. Because whenever he smiled my anger melted away. `` I'm sorry, son,'' he said in a booming voice, `` but I had to... you have to learn.'' \n \n `` Learn what?'' I protested, `` learn to watch tragedy, to watch the worst in people?'' \n \n `` Exactly,'' Father said, `` but a bit more.'' \n \n I started to say something but Father held up a hand. `` You must learn to give free will.

She rented a small room at a daily rate in a crap part of town out by the airport. She cleaned rooms for a little money, but she could hardly afford the rent and to keep herself fed. Most people never saw her as anything more than a rat living in squalor in the places nobody would ever go. She had been taken advantage of one way or another her entire life. When the loud knock came to her door, she was terrified. A man on the other side called out her name. `` Deborah, I need to speak to you about something.'' She did n't recognize the voice. She peered through the peep-hole and saw an older gentleman in a business suit. He had a classic brief case in his right hand. He looked intimidating. Stern. She backed away from the door. He knocked again. \n \n After a few more moments, the door seemed to unlock on its own. Someone had given the man a key. He stepped into the room carefully, as if overly concerned that someone would be found dead or dying around the corner. When he saw Deborah on the floor curled up into a ball he tried to gently reassure her. She had heard gunshots the previous night. She was spooked. The man stepped back and called for the motel attendant. A famiar face. A young-ish boy with a goatee and a ponytail that worked the night shift. \n \n `` M'am'' the boy said. `` This fella is with the insurance company. Something happened to one of our guests in the room down the hall. He's got business with ya.'' \n \n The man stepped forward again. `` Deborah? Deb? Can I call you Deb? I'm Pierce with Barnard Daily Insurance. There appears to have been an incident with a man down the hall. He was a customer of ours. He had a life insurance policy. I do n't know if you knew him, but his name was Saul. Maybe you've seen him around?'' \n \n She had n't. She knew nothing about this supposed person. \n \n `` Well, Deb, I'm sorry. This is a peculiar circumstance. The man had taken out a life insurance policy some time ago. He had changed the beneficiary a few times over the years. He most recently changed it to your name. I ca n't say why or how, but the man has since then taken his own life. I'm... um... sorry for your loss. This is a grave matter, but you are the sole beneficiary on Saul's policy.''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] 2016 ends with a cyborg Hitler leading the Nazis to bomb Times Square seconds before midnight .\n","story":"Joe Hammond looked away from his tablet, as he shot HD video of the ball drop. No one chanted along with the countdown, the numbers flashing across the jumbo-tron. Something drew the attention of the thousands of spectators, shivering in the glittering cold of a Times Square New Years Eve Celebration. The indiscernible rumble of crowd noise hushed as heads of the tall and the small looked down Broadway, to see what could possibly be causing enough noise to distract from the biggest party in the world. Joe could hear rhythmic thuds, much like marching. The people furthest back began to scream, and like lightning, the attitude of terror rippled through the multitude. What was once a joyous collective of peoples from every continent on the globe mere seconds ago, became a panicked mass of pushing and rushing in every direction. Mounted police spurred their steeds on, trying to get through the crowd to handle the danger, but the people impeded their galloping like a strong current in a river. \n \n Joe was shoved along in one direction while his friends were pulled in another, his gloved fingers ripped from the pink-mittened hand of Sarah. They had only been on about five dates, but he was already starting to like this one. Her eyes were horrified as their grasp broke, and she shouted his name, her voice lost amongst the yelling. He tried to get his feet under himself, but the crowd was carrying him along. Joe attempted to call out her name, before her face disappeared into the chaos, but someone else's forearm caught him in the neck, knocking the air from his words. \n \n Painfully, his back collided with something, and the swarm of people pushed past him. He was finally able to catch his breath, realizing it was a piece of scaffolding he had banged into. He could not see a thing; the people rushing past in fear were a blur. In his hand, the other one, the one that was not responsible for holding onto Sarah, he still held his tablet. He grimaced, hating himself for holding onto a stupid gadget instead of her. \n \n The rhythmic thumping was getting louder, and there seemed to be a chanting along with it. He could not quite make out the words, but they were angry, deep voices. Then the gunfire started. The people ducked and scampered, not knowing where to go or who was shooting at whom. Joe saw no other alternative than to climb the scaffolding. Maybe if he got out of the crowd, and could look down at it, he might find his friends and Sarah. He could even use the zoom feature on the tablet's camera to help him look. He made it to the top, where a few other people huddled. \n \n Joe held up the device, the video still recording from before, and zoomed in as much as the camera could discern features. He scanned the masses of bodies, flinging themselves in one direction or another. He tried to remember what everyone was wearing. Was Sarah's coat black or brown?! But it was hopeless. There was too much movement to know one person from another. Bullets cracked the wall behind him, and the people on the scaffolding dived for their lives, some jumping straight down into the crowd. Joe peeked over the ledge and the danger was drawing nearer. \n \n Rows and rows of soldiers marched in perfect formation as they fired weapons at the fleeing people. They did not appear to be quite human, most of them having robotic-like parts. Joe held up his tablet again, recording video of the massacre. The camera showed enough detail that he was able to recognize what they were, or at least what they were attempting to mimic. And at the head of the pack marched the biggest of them all. \n \n A man's head was positioned on the shoulders of a massive mechanical suit. At first, Joe was not sure if it was simply the decapitated trophy of the robot, mounted on top to instill fear. But the longer he watched, the more he was sure the owner of the head was alive, at least in some sense, as the head turned and pivoted, just like a human's when it aimed it's guns. Though, that metal body was foreign to him and everyone here, that face was unmistakable; that chanting, though Joe did not understand it, recognizably German. \n \n Joe snorted a mirthless sound, more of exasperation than any other emotion. After everything that the world had been through this year, after all the bad and the ugly and the tedious and tough that 2016 had put them through, Joe never would have believe it could get any worse. Certainly God or the Universe or whatever could n't possibly top themselves here at the very end, after everything humanity had been through. But there he was, in the flesh, or rather, the metal. \n \n Joe shook his head, and whispered `` Literally Hitler.''\n"}

Great may have been an overstatement, the old man reflected upon seeing the diminutive figure that set foot on stage. And yet, he had a poise about him that was difficult to place. The old man watch quietly from the back of the room as the Great Santiago pulled a rabbit from an apparently empty hat. The audience cheered loudly, but for a moment the old man began to second guess if his coming here was right after all. He deftly slipped his hand into the pocket of his cloak and idly felt the gnarled furnishings of his all so familiar wand. For a moment, he was reassured in his quest. Something was off in this place, he felt in his bones. Faint whisperings on the wind carried tidings of ill omen; the Val Dakin had been found. If the old man were to confront a foe as powerful as this, he would rather have a mage to accompany him, or at least an alchemist. But as it were, the Great Illusionist Santiago would have to be help enough. After all, he was the greatest magician in the land, or so they said. The decision was made. Once the show was over, the old man would head behind the stage and plead his case to Santiago, imploring for his help. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n The curtains closed slowly as the applause grew only louder. Today had been a good show, Santiago thought to himself as he drew back quickly off of the stage and made for his rear office. He was not at all prepared for what awaited him there. The old man with the long cloak and pointy hat looked for all the world like a caricature of some ancient warlock. His words were no less alarming. \n \n `` Quickly, you must help me. A great evil has come to this land, the Val Dakin. He must be stopped.'' \n \n Santiago pondered this briefly. `` A great evil you say? Then how do you propose to contain it?'' \n \n At once, the old man drew a gnarled stick from his cloak and began to prance about the room. `` Why, with a spell of containment, of course,'' he said. \n \n `` A spell of containment?'' If only there was such a thing. `` Look,'' Santiago said, `` I am just a simple illusionist, and I have a feeling that you are just a mad-man in a cape. I'm sorry, but I'm sure I can be of no help to you in this quest.'' As though to emphasize his point, Santiago drew a rabbit from behind him, seemingly from nowhere. `` You see? This is what I do.'' \n \n The old man was taken aback, but now began to plead all the more fervently. `` But he must be contained. We can do it together. I know magic,'' the old man insisted. \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' said Santiago, slow petting the rabbit in his arms, `` but I really must go.'' The Great Illusionist Santiago turn to face his office door and set forward quickly toward the hallway beyond. As he passed the threshold, and with great flutter of motion, he snapped his fingers and the rabbit disappeared. This time, there could be no mistake. The rabbit had simply vanished into thin air. Val Dakin. That was a name he had not heard in a long time, Santiago thought to himself as he fled rapidly down the corridor. He had a new name now, an appearance that must be maintained. A vague smirk crossed his face. Illusions, he would continue to call them that. His audience was n't ready for the truth anyways. Besides, the old man posed no threat to him. His secret would remain safe, at least for now.\n"}

These buildings were so odd to him. It was nothing like he had experienced before. He arrived at the end of the hall way and stood in front of two humans holding long metal devices. Both of their eyes grew wider than he thought possible when he approached them. \n \n \u201c These beings are so\u2026odd looking. \u201d He thought to Gen \u2019 ralis. \n \n \u201c I agree sir. They look like little Norrogs. \u201d Gen \u2019 ralis thought back to him. The image of the furry-topped little minions from their home planet crossed his mind causing him to grin. Yenfelda in the back must \u2019 ve caught a tail of the image because she too grinned. \n \n The two humans let them through the door. The door was too low, requiring them to duck under to fit through. Morthinji folded his wings in to avoid the thinly spaced door sides. He stepped into a room full of humans glaring at him. He held a calm disposition; this wasn \u2019 t his first time confronting a new species. One of the humans in the middle spoke first. \n \n \u201c General Morthinji, welcome to Earth. We are a species governed by multiple different authorities and governments. \u201d As the human talked, Morthinji was busy talking with his comrades behind him. \n \n \u201c What is a government? Yenfelda, did you read anything about that? \u201d He thought to her. \n \n \u201c I tried but I couldn \u2019 t get my mind entirely around it. Basically, they have laws that the people must obey or they will be punished for it. \u201d Yenfelda thought with a hint of disgust. \n \n \u201c Laws? \u201d Morthinji thought to the both of them. Gen \u2019 ralis had nothing to add. Morthinji took the question to the human talking. \n \n \u201c Human, what are these laws you have created? \u201d \n \n The human was taken aback. It was a question he clearly didn \u2019 t expect to be asked. \u201c To which law are you referring general? \u201d \n \n \u201c To these laws in generality. What are they for? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, society can not function without set laws for people to obey. Without order, there is chaos, general. \u201d \n \n Morthinji wanted more. \u201c And you punish your people for disobeying laws that another equal man put in place? \u201d \n \n \u201c In our system, it is the only way society will function properly. \u201d \n \n Morthinji was met with extreme disgust upon hearing the human \u2019 s explanation. His frustration carried over to his companions who tried to block it out of their minds. \n \n \u201c Human, I will tell you this. Of all the places I have been across the galaxy, you are the first to require such things of your own people. \u201d Morthinji said, now looking down upon the human in front of him. \n \n The human was now frustrated as well. \u201c You come from a completely different civilization, with different functions and different ways of life. It is not your position to judge us when you come from a differing society. \u201d \n \n The air in the room changed with his statement. \u201c You call this life? If you call the act of limiting your own people to the point of being reprimanded for acting freely a definition of living, you may be the most vile society I \u2019 ve ever come across. \u201d \n \n Gen \u2019 ralis sent wave after wave of calming thoughts to ease the situation for him. Morthinji finally calmed down and thanked Gen \u2019 ralis. \n \n \u201c My apologies. Maybe if I explain how it is within my society it will give you a better idea of why the idea of limitation is so wrong to us. In our society we are all equal, no one male or female is above another. Even in jobs we are equal. We do not believe in limiting ones right to live freely. We were all created to live freely, were we not? \u201d \n \n \u201c That is a very touching idea general Morthinji, but lawless society has been tried here before and it has failed over and over again. To implement something that historically does not work would be a form of insanity. You came to us general, not the other way around. What do you want? \u201d \n \n Yenfelda sent a thought to him, \u201c Maybe it is the people themselves. We knew they were of lower intelligence. It could be that they don \u2019 t possess the ability to naturally form limitless society. \n \n Gen \u2019 ralis seemed to agree. \u201c These humans can not be farther from redemption than we were at the beginning. We must try and help them Morthinji. \n \n General Morthinji expected another one of the humans to speak up but the rest remained silent in front of him. \n \n \u201c Our job is to make this world a better place. We are here to abolish leadership and create an equal and free world. We intend to recreate the experience of free, limitless life that our home society is able to enjoy. If you are willing, we would require your help in achieving this goal. \u201d \n \n While Morthinji meant it as a positive thing, the humans reacted extremely negatively. All of a sudden, they were all very nervous. The human in the middle got off of a device held to his ear and looked back at Morthinji. \n \n \u201c I thought this might be the case. \u201d He said as he nodded to someone behind Morthinji. \n \n While Morthinji was fast, getting taken by surprise was something he did not expect. As soon as the human nodded, projectiles fired from both sides. Electricity flowed through his body rendering it useless. Men were on top of him attaching metal circles around all four of his hands, joining them together by links. With a last mental cry, Morthinji called out to his people. \n \n \u201c Help! We are being taken captive! Come to Earth, free us! \u201d \n \n The man above him lifted the long metal device and slammed it down on Morthinji \u2019 s head, enveloping his mind in darkness. \n \n Edit: fostradamus's point has been fixed.

It may be the lack of coffee as my brain processed the image, but my lifeless eyes stared back into mine. My own body lay before, outstretched and fileted like I was dumped here after an autopsy. \n \n Slowly standing up, I turned to my partner. His face turned pale as his brain failed to process the paradox. It was me alright, down to every detail and scarring. A matching scar protruding from a bearded chin, cropped hair disheveled from wearing to many hats, crooked front teeth as my doppelgangers mouth hung open. \n \n More sirens sped toward us, police sirens resonating off the downtown spires creating an echo chamber, inching ever closer. `` It was him! He did it!'' \n \n A shout came from behind me, turning to see a masked figure. I could n't tell if it was the shadows from the street lamps, or if the mystery man was wearing a scarf. He repeated the phrase, louder this time as a small circle of onlookers formed around me. Familiar thudding of car doors slamming broke my gaze. Police boots interrupted the now silent mass. \n \n The new towns crier piped again, motion for the officers to hustle. `` It was him!'' The gravel voice bellowed, `` I saw it all!'' The police came to the same confusion after a brief inspection. I found myself slowly inching backwards, stumbling over my footing. `` He has the knife in his pocket!'' He pointed, his voice now a growl. As if becoming angry no one believed him. The stranger pulled a hood over his head as he slowly disappeared into the crowd. \n \n With a shaking hand I reached into my pocket, finding the shaft of a steel blade. Pulling it from my pocket and dropping it, the weapon covered in dried blood. The cops faces went from bewilderment, returning to the familiar scowl of skull breaker mode. With an awkward glance at each other, they drew their weapons. The crowd now beginning to flee with haste in ever direction. As the stranger seemed to apparate with the fog. \n \n At first the orders were calm, almost weak in the revelation. As their only suspect backpeddled faster. My head in a daze, my vision spinning as emergency lights seemed to blur together. Dropping my bags. I turned to run...\n"}

I do n't think I've ever seen him mad but I guess every guy has a beast inside him. It's just a matter of what it takes to make that part of him come out. We were having some fun, rough housing around the house while our roommates were locked in their bedrooms, doing all sorts of deviant little things. That's quite alright. We're more of the shy type but we understand that in the heat of the moment some things happen and they can be quite awesome. I somehow pinned him to the ground and gave him the good ol' tickling of death to which he started laughing hysterically. It took me awhile to notice that he was actually crying, and when I questioned him about it he tossed me off of him and left. I almost didn \u2019 t recognize him as he did it. \n \n Matt, his best friend, gave me a call the next morning telling me that Ben stormed into his apartment raving mad. They almost got into a fight until he calmed him down enough to talk to him. `` Look, give him a few days to calm down. He'll tell you when he's ready. Just do n't pressure him and it'll be fine.'' That was all he told me when I asked what I did wrong. They've been friends since elementary school and know everything about each other. If I did n't know better, I think I would be jealous. \n \n Saturday rolled around and he finally came back home. It did n't look like he shaved since he left and he was still in the same clothes. I did n't want to test whether he took a shower or not so I pretended to do some housekeeping. `` Hey.'' Ok, he was n't exactly a wordsmith but I found it hysterical that this was the first thing he thought to say to me. I do n't know exactly what came over me next, whether it was mostly a joke or whether I was genuinely upset at him, but I decided to play the upset housewife. \n \n `` Hey? Really? That's the first thing you say to me after you disappear and go who knows where?'' I stared at him for a moment as he stood there stunned. `` Well? Say something!'' I tossed the dishrag I was wiping the counter with at him, or at least in his general direction. I was never good at any task that required some hand eye coordination and the aerodynamic properties of the rag didn \u2019 t help. I did however hit the pot hanging over the island hard enough that it knocked it off its hook. Physics thought it funny to bounce the pot off of the counter causing the handle to strike him right in the groin. \n \n I saw him collapse to the floor almost instantly and had the most sincere oh-my-god moment of my life as I ran over to him. Then my mouth completely betrayed my concern. I could n't keep myself from laughing as I saw his body sprawled on the ground with his two hands cupping his injured member. The laughing continued for awhile and it didn \u2019 t exactly stop as I asked him if he was alright. `` I'm so sorry,'' came out in between a stream of chuckles. The fact that a single tap in the right ( wrong? ) area could completely cripple someone is perhaps the most interesting part of man's physiology. and clearly the most hilarious. Though he would n't get up for another ten minutes, he was n't going to take this lying down. As I swooped down to help him up he reached out and pinched my inner thigh, hard. I yelped in pain, lost my footing and fell beside him. \n \n `` Ow, ow, ow. That\u2026'' \n \n `` Don \u2019 t. Don \u2019 t' even say that it hurts. You do n't know what pain is.'' His voice was clearly pained and as soon as he pinched me his hands went back to cupping. I could n't help but look at him and crack a smile. \n \n `` Does that really hurt that much?'' \n \n `` You have no clue.'' He returned a smile and wrapped his arm around me. \n \n `` I'm sorry, about everything really. There are some things that I have n't told you about my family and some of the things that happened. I\u2026I just did n't know how.'' I saw the sadness creep into his face. \n \n `` It's ok. It's really ok.'' I kissed him on the cheek and held him as close as I could. `` You do n't have to tell me everything. I love you so much. I'll be here forever no matter what.'' He turned to look me in the eye. I do n't know why but I started to cry. He kissed me. \n \n And then the door swung open. Scott took one look at us lying on the floor, kissing with tears in our eyes and the pot over Ben's junk, and said `` You two are really weird. Please do n't do that in the kitchen.'' \n\n"}

This virus, I do n't know how to describe it, but it, makes people rot while they're still alive. They can feel it to. John, one of my squad mates, got infected. We had to lock him outside of the compound. When his flesh started to rot he began screaming and screaming for hours on end. I still remember how his eye was dangling out of his eye socket. Sorry, I just needed to get that off my chest. \n \n We're in a military compound in the Mojave desert. We have around thirty survivors. The general is dead, shot himself in the head after learning that his family died. The people look to us soldiers look up to me for help, considering I'm second in command.

This is what you were meant to do, who you were meant to be, and why you exist. \n \n I have had one of those moments. \n \n We met in high school, a year apart in grade. It was a typical day. My friends and I were eating lunch in the cafeteria when for some reason I was compelled to look across the large room. I'd never seen her before. She was laughing and talking to her friends, but there was something about her. \n \n It was that moment. When I looked at her, there may well have been nobody in the room but her and I. For a moment, when she took a sip of her drink, her beautiful eyes looked from her friends and over to me. \n \n Butterflies. \n \n Butterflies yes, and a knowledge that it was n't just some innocent flirtation. It was n't just two people who gave nervous glances, looking at and away. It was, for me, my moment. \n \n We both graduated from high school and being a year apart, I had left for college across the country. I was n't very focused in my schooling, but I had good enough grades to get into a decent college. It was a challenge, that first year. It would n't be long even if it felt like it, she graduated and joined me in college. she could have gone to any school of her choice, but she came to me because it was where we were. \n \n We would go on to graduate from school and move on to careers, eventually having children of our own. Two wonderful kids; a boy and a girl. It was n't always perfect, but the knowledge that this was it a part of our journey together, is what we were here for. \n \n They have both grown up to be amazing and loving parents of their own. We have enjoyed the holidays together, seeing their successes and helping them through their troubled times. When we saw them with their loved ones, we could see it in their eyes for one another. \n \n It was that same look we shared so many years ago. It was not long before there were grand-kids running around the house. The holidays were always the best times. We were gifted with so many over the years that it is impossible to keep track of them all. Especially at my age. Last Christmas was for me the most special of them all. That was when I got this watch. \n \n It may not look like much, but it was just like the one I had when I was younger. She found it on the internet for me, some place on the east coast. the catch was, the watch did n't work. She figured, with all the spare time we have being retired, I could get it to work. \n \n I had the same watch when we met so many years ago and wore it for years, but like all things, eventually stop working. I would have bought one if I had found one, but you know how it is with life. you get busy, some things become less important while other things become more important. My family is the most important thing to me. \n \n In February, things took a turn. We spent more time at the hospital than we did at home. It seemed whenever she was well enough to go home for any stretch, she would have to go right back in. They were hard days. She spent most of her time sleeping and I would sit there in my chair next to her bed, and watch over her. She was so still. I could see the strong woman I had known through my life but she was also that young girl I wanted to take care of. I did n't know what to do. \n \n I fell asleep from time to time in that chair and sometimes when I opened my eyes, she would smile at me and tell me she remembered how that one day, so many years ago she got butterflies because a boy looked across a crowded room at her. She lifted her hand to me and I reached out and took it. Those same eyes, those beautiful eyes were unchanged by the years. \n \n It was on February 23rd at 7:48 pm when she had to leave us. There was no condition, no disease to hate. It was just her time. The girl turned woman, turned grandmother had to let go. \n \n I spent the next month fixing the watch she gave me for Christmas. I had to learn how to use the internet, thankfully I have an able and patient grandchild who did most of the work finding all the parts I needed, and the physical work due to my shaking hands. We closed up the back of the watch and spun the arm. \n \n The watch began to tick and the second hand began to work its way clockwise around the face of the watch. A feeling of sadness washed over me, and I hoped she was able to see us repair the watch, wherever she is. \n \n I left the watch on the table and ordered some pizza for my assistant. A reward for a job well done. His father picked him up a little after seven and thanked me for watching over him after school. I always considered the days I got to spend with my grandchildren a blessing. \n \n The house was quiet now. I ca n't say I was used to it. I walked into the kitchen and began to clean up the remainder of the pizza dinner on the table when I saw the watch. I picked it up by the brown leather band and turned it over. Picking up the small screw driver I removed the back cover off and proceeded to remove the parts of the watch that would allow the second hand to spin. \n \n Replacing the cover, I flipped the watch over and strapped it on over my wrist. It was 7:48pm. That was when our moment ended and I will never forget. \n \n \n\n"}

These people were n't very smart. The crew stared at the events unfolding for what seemed like an eternity, then with a loud explosion and smoke from a cannon, the boat fired at the helicopter. The heli maneuvered and dodged the shot. What the fuck just happened? A voice came on the radio, `` Captain this is Big Bird 13 requesting permission to engage the boat''. I did n't even have to think. `` Roger Big Bird, permission to engage.'' \n \n The whirl of the Seahawks M134 Minigun was music to everyone's ears. Spinning up ready to spew out steaming hot 7.62mm caliber bullets at a rate of 6,000 rounds per minute upon something out of a wood workshop class. The boat was ripped to shreds - breaking apart with every bullet while sparks jump from the barrel of the machine gun like fireworks on 4th of July.

Its Melody.... she is trying to leave through the opposite end of the lunch room, clutching her arm which is bleeding. BAM! as her back explodes and she falls.. NOOO! `` Oh My god'' Im saying as I feel my legs about to give out. This is the worst single experience I believe I will ever have. When I imagined shooting them, it was always followed by a feeling of pleasure that they would never torment another person ever. This was anything but that. \n \n I have to do something! Its only been 10 full seconds since the shooting started, but it feel like eternity. I cant let this happen, this is wrong and I dont see how I could ever think something like this could be the answer to my problems. I walk towards Tony, expecting to get shot same as the others. I'm surprisingly not scared.. More `` Resolute'' than anything. This has to stop. Tony looks a bit nervous but he does n't shoot, most likely because A. I dont yet have a firearm and B. He can probably already tell by the shotgun stock sitting out of the bag that I was here to do the same. \n \n `` I do n't know how this happened, coming to shoot these fuckers at the same exact moment'' He says. `` Dude, this is totally fucked!'' I say. He finishes with `` Yeah well, its too late now''. I grab the pump action of the shotgun without even thinking. I cant let this happen. By now he realizes that even though we came for the same thing, we are obviously not on the same team as of this moment. We struggle, with me trying to pry the shotgun away and him trying to elbow me wherever it will land. I do n't let go. Even if I have to kick, bite, scratch, I do n't give a.....

Then I noticed Cory drop to his knees. Clutching his chest with a great look of fear on his face, I realize he has a punisher shirt on also... It too has a bullet hole with blood streaming out of it. This is getting pretty strange. I look over at Tony who was trying tobreath, but like myself just could n't find that refreshing inhale he was searching for.. \n \n As the three of us lie here gasping for that breath, I could n't help but to wonder...

Her two eldest daughters, twins of identical beauty, were sixteen this year and would finally be allowed to take lovers. They had spent the last several weeks learning about, trying on, and playing with various paints, perfumes, and dyes to look their best. Now since ablutions they had not come out of their chambers, refusing until they looked perfect. \n \n `` Let them make themselves as beautiful as they desire,'' Diana mother, Artemia, said, coming out of another room with her grandson in her arms. He was clothed in gentle cloth for the day was hot, and there would be traveling for several hours. `` They may have flirted and exchanged blushing comments last year with the young men, but it is another thing entirely to go to their beds.'' \n \n `` I know. But it is silly to make yourself perfect now, before we travel.'' Of course that was something you learned because it happened to you, not because your mother said so. \n \n Diana took her son from her mother with a sad smile, trying to keep from falling into anguish again. She had managed to remain cheerful until now, not giving too much thought to the time ahead. Her daughters were women, and her son... In four days they would be back in their women's city and her son would no longer be in her arms. At barely three months he still needed his mother's touch and milk, but as a man he could not stay any longer than the time between birth and the yearly Meeting. She wanted to keep him, hold him for at least another year.. if he went now he might die. But that was why they were separated, or so legends said. Women were sentimental in a way men were not. She had carried and bore her son, while his father had only known his own pleasure a year past. He might not even take the boy into his home when they met again. There would be no choice other than to lay her precious child at the gates and leave, praying with every breath that someone would open their doors and take in the child.. she had seen it happen, once as a younger girl. A woman leaving her son, the cries throughout the day that reached their caravan... the cries that did not stop after the men left for their own home. The cries of the mother after the cries of her child had finally stopped. \n \n `` Perhaps if we say I and he are ill, and can not travel?'' \n \n `` You can not.'' Artemia stroked Agapios's cheek and then hugged her daughter tightly. `` The gods would know you lie, and there would be punishment brought down upon us.'' \n \n `` What if he is not accepted?'' \n \n `` Sh. He was your lover, do you distrust yourself so much? This is a happy time. Your daughters are women, you may find yourself a grandmother soon as well. You told me he was kind and dear. You will spend the two days with him, speaking about your son, and being a family.'' \n \n She nodded, sniffling and wiping away tears. `` You are right, mother, of course. Such a heartless act has not happened in years.'' \n \n `` Mother!'' \n \n `` Mama!'' \n \n Her two daughters finally dashed down the hall to them, one with her sandals and the other with bare feet. Their make-up was a little heavy, and they wore a bit too much scent, but they were smiling and proud of their appearance. After a day of walking the extra would be gone anyway, and she could help reapply moderate amounts. \n \n `` You look lovely.'' Tears welled in her eyes again but she blinked them back. Silly emotions, she had forgotten how strong they were during and soon after a babe. The family took what few things they would needed to bring, gave thanks to the gods, and began their journey to see the men. \n \n -- - \n \n Really fun premise, OP.

A brick wall dug into my spine, only to pull back and strike it again and again as sobs wracked my body. This was it. \n \n Behind me, the city slept. Its lights were dimmed, its eyes were closed. My eyes squeezed shut, but tears broke free to run down my face and mingle with snot. Hugging my knees, I made no move to wipe them off. No one would see, but it did n't matter regardless. \n \n Gone. A wail built in my throat. Strangled by the sobs and gasps, it tore from me in a high pitched keen. The wall struck my back again -- once, twice, three times. *Gone. * \n \n I had tried. My arms shook with the exhaustion that hounded me after weeks of working both of my jobs. My feet were swollen and covered in blisters from countless hours walking from table to table, then shelf to shelf. Here, though, agony of a worse sort burned through the physical pain. \n \n The latest notice crumpled in my hand. Crisp white paper that told me I was a mess, and polite, firm words that said everything I did had n't been enough. I had said I would work things out, and I would n't fail. \n \n I had lied. \n \n The keening rose higher as cold seeped through my clothes, but it could n't touch the cold of missing hands. Gone. I had watched expressions turn from love and conviction into confusion and fright. I had failed, and I had nothing left but the cold and emptiness of a forgotten alley. \n \n A warm coat settled over my shoulders. Clinging desperately to myself, trying to hold together the broken pieces, I could n't even look up. A hand cupped my chin and lifted my face towards the night sky. \n \n `` Please,'' the voice broke, `` please, baby, look at me.'' \n \n I could n't open my eyes. I could n't see that face and the despair it held. The hand withdrew. My arms squeezed tighter, but the pieces slipped through, cracking on the cement below. \n \n That is, until another pair of arms closed around mine. Their warmth thawed the ice of the air, and their strength held off the world. My breaking pieces held, even as my body quaked. `` It will be alright, I promise you,'' the voice said, shaking. `` We will make it through this, too. Just-just do n't leave. Please, do n't leave.'' \n \n New tears slipped into mine, falling from the face above. They were warm and sweet and stung my chapped lips. `` I'm sorry,'' I whispered. `` I failed you.'' \n \n `` Never.'' The voice was fierce. \n \n `` But I could n't do it. I lost it -- there's nothing left anymore.'' \n \n `` There's me,'' I felt as much as heard the sob break from the one who held me together. `` Please... there's me. Do n't you leave me too.'' \n \n I let go of myself and held on. `` Never.'' I promised. Pain and desperation stained my voice, but it was not a lie. \n \n As the city slept, we clung to each other, and our broken pieces fell into place.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ IP ] Write a story about how this cat 's eyes became the way they are .\n","story":"Tipsy was a normal green eyed white coat, a decent mouser, and a careful street crosser. Although born a stray he had no aversion to humans. He often let the calm-seeming ones get within ten cat-lengths of him. Urban life was not a good place for Tipsy. From a young age he hunted in the grass fields beyond the concrete walls of his dumpster home. He made a nest like a bird at a corner between two cinder block walls at the edge of a field. His life was pleasant. Mice, birds, and the occasional lizard filled his belly till he was seven moons. Then he caught the Tom sickness, like all male cats do, and although he did n't want to leave his soft pleasant life, instinct drove him to search for Heat. It was a sunny afternoon when he caught *her scent. * A she cat in her second heat. From her smell he notices she still smelled of kits and milk, a normal scent for a she-cat to have at the beginning of a heat, but something was off about her. She smelled like memories of soft warm paper nests. As he caught up to her, he saw why she carried memories on her pelt. It was his litter mate, Kaykay. Her coat was white but eyes blue like the sky, and a small black patch on her left paw. She was about to cross a street that was running on the edge of a row of houses. Looking to her left, she sniffed the air and twitched her tail as a car came closer. She stood behind the white line and waited. Tipsy walked toward her, brushing almost silently through the grass. The car was closer and Kaykay padded back from the edge and into the short grass at the side of the road. The cars front end veered off of the path. Tipsy knew the car would hit her, he raced through the grass now. If only he could push her between the wheels, then she would be okay, frightened, but okay. He tackled her from behind, pushing her into the low safe zone between the cars big crushing wheels. He was not fast enough, though she was saved it was his own body that was smacked by the black rubber. He seemed to flip sideways, disoriented until he landed, hard. He was alive, but barely. He watched as his sister darted out from beneath the car, glancing at him and giving an apologetic wave of her tail. The fear in her eyes told Tipsy that she would be racing to him if the human had n't stopped the car and gotten out. The sound of its great paws smacking closer on the pavement made Tipsy want to run, but the pain in his body seemed to be everywhere. It hurt to breathe. There was no way he was going to run. He knew it. The pain grew more intense as adrenaline rushed through his body when the human touched him, and Tipsy faded into the waiting blackness. In the blackness that not even his nose could cut through, Tipsy felt someone else. Not with his whiskers, but his life force. Something was pulling him, as if from a dream, a pulling sensation, but the darkness clung inside him. The pulling force yanked him upwards, warming and brightening his soul. Then sleep. Not the blackness, but a dreamy haze that was sleep. He was again in his mothers paper nest, kneading her breast, warmly squished next to three other kits. The haze lifted to reveal a neat, white room. A woman walked in, and again he could n't move. He was paralyzed. Her touch warmed him further, and her hand soothed the rough fur on his side. Their eyes locked, and he heard cat-speak in his mind. \n \n `` I really should n't have been driving. I was very tired and was n't paying attention. I... I killed you.'' The woman gave a sad look. Tipsy mewed back in response. \n \n `` But then how am I here?'' He knew something was unusual about this human. \n \n `` I healed you, in a way.'' She told his mind. `` You are not whole though.'' He listened to her thoughts and did quick self inventory. Nothing was missing. \n \n `` What is not here?'' He mewed again. \n \n `` You only have half your heart.'' She responded. \n \n `` What does that mean?'' He asked her. \n \n `` It means your actions do not determine what you do after death. Only what you did before the first death, Tipsy.'' She went silent for a moment. `` It also means you look a little different. Come look. `` she pointed to a shiny thing that did n't seem to be in the room a moment ago. He stood, no longer immobile, and walked to it. In the reflection he saw himself, but one of his eyes was different. It was a color he had only seen once. The color of the flowers that grow on the glossy green vines. Purple.\n"}

They have no history, oral, written, or drawn -- no stories of the past or hopes for the future. They call themselves the Hi'aiti'ihi: `` the straight ones.'' And they hide a great secret. \n \n The sun burned high in the sky, as brilliantly as it had the last time John and Fiona had coasted down the river, fifty years ago. It glared at them imperiously, its eye a smoldering blister in the clear blue day. It did n't care. For the sun, this day was as plain as the last and as uncertain as the next. It blazed without worry, that it might live forever. \n \n Fiona wiped a slick of sweat from her brow, leaving her forearm uncomfortably damp and sticky. As inescapable as the heat was, the humidity was such that she was forever covered in a miserable, sweaty dew -- even during the night, when some of the day's feverish warmth had receded. She peered over the side of the canoe, wondering for a moment whether she'd be drier if she were in the water. \n \n `` Are you okay, love?'' John's voice sounded hoarse and phlegmy. The heat never treated him well. He cleared the catarrh from his throat and placed a pallid hand upon her shoulder. `` We're nearly there.'' \n \n Fiona laid her hand atop John's and massaged it. How quickly his skin had changed. What once was the soft fragility of infancy had eventually become this, had given way to leathery senility. The idea was revolting, though John was not. \n \n `` I wish you had n't made a habit of smoking,'' Fiona said, catching John out the corner of her eye. `` Then we would n't be here so soon.'' \n \n `` Sorry.'' John's body shook as he fought to hold in a cough. `` It seemed like it might be fun: smoking without the consequences.'' He grinned, and it was the same shit-eating grin that Fiona had fallen in love with. A smile that could stir the heart of a stone. `` And it is n't as though we would n't have had to come soon, anyway. I'm sixty-five. Hell, you're fifty!'' \n \n `` Let's just make sure we do n't go through this scare again.'' Fiona squeezed John's hand and let go. \n \n `` Okay, I promise.'' \n \n `` Mister John,'' the man at the paddle said, `` Is that the place, over there?'' \n \n `` Yes,'' John called back. `` There should be a man waiting.'' He scanned the shore for a few moments, searching. `` Ah, there he is!'' \n \n There was always a man waiting, watching, keeping guard. His treasure was well-hidden, but even still, it was more precious than any other thing on earth. Fiona wondered whether the Hi'aiti'ihi knew this. Perhaps their desire to guard the fountain was an atavistic instinct from long ago. It was even possible that the little man at the shore was n't a guard at all. Maybe he was just there. He was always there. \n \n The guide brought the canoe to the shore with no fuss, using the current to gently guide the small boat and bring it parallel to the bank. The vertebrae in the small of Fiona's back cracked pleasantly as she rose. She held her hand out for John, who took it with a shaky grip. The little guard waved at them enthusiastically. \n \n `` I'll be back soon,'' Fiona told the guide. The spry man hopped from the the canoe and began to make it fast to the trunk of a leaning tree. \n \n `` Fiona,'' the guard pointed. Fiona nodded and smiled. The last time he'd seen her, she'd been an infant. The guard grinned ear to ear, revealing a row of perfect white teeth. `` John?'' \n \n `` Yup,'' John wheezed. He had just risen from the canoe, and he was already out of breath. Fiona that she saw a frown hiding behind his murky green eyes. \n \n `` Come, come!'' The guard gestured. It was a miracle that he had remembered the few English words they had taught him all of those years ago. But the little guard was an amazing man; he was the man who had saved Fiona's life. And for him, perhaps miracles were but the foundation of his every day. Should it have been strange that he looked younger today than he had fifty years ago, when a fifteen year-old John had cradled Fiona's frail frame in his spindly arms? \n \n `` Fountain?'' he asked. \n \n `` Yes,'' Fiona said. She pressed John's rough hand tightly between her own. \n \n `` Come, come,'' the man repeated. \n \n `` Fiona,'' John began. There was a catch in his voice, so he began again. `` Fiona, I do n't know.'' \n \n She looked back at him. What was it? The furrow of his brow spoke of more pain than his pride would allow him to express. Had it really taken him this far, the cancer? `` What do n't you know, John?'' \n \n `` I love you,'' John said. `` I've loved you longer than any man has ever loved a woman. Six hundred years ago, Fiona. Six hundred years ago, I came here with you. To save you.'' \n \n `` John, stop.'' Fiona wanted to shout, but it was only a whisper. The guard watched, curious. Whether the man could make out what John was saying mattered little to Fiona. `` Please, let's get you to the fountain.'' \n \n `` I've wondered this entire time,'' John said. `` Was I really saving you, or was I saving myself?'' \n \n `` You were saving both of us.'' There were tears in her eyes, then. Hot tears. God damn the heat. God damn it. She pulled at his arm, but the sixty-five year-old John was strong for his age, as he had been at fifteen. He would n't budge. She clawed at his chest, grabbed his shoulders, his neck. \n \n `` Fiona, I only ever wanted to save you. I want you to be able to live for yourself. Remember Etienne? What about Herrara? I ca n't make you stay with me forever. You should n't have to.'' \n \n `` John, you were a child when I met both of them. That is n't fair!'' \n \n `` It is n't? You know what is n't fair? We've cheated death for nearly six hundred years! Everything we are is unfair to everyone, everywhere else. And I'm dying, Fiona. I'm dying, and I've never felt this close to the end. It's stupid, saying this, but there's something about it that feels right.'' \n \n John shook his hand free, stood straight as a soldier. He was a soldier, after all, was n't he? Fiona's favorite soldier. A great conqueror. He smiled: that shit-eating grin. There was a sad confidence there, behind his watering eyes. \n \n `` Why now?'' Fiona wondered. `` When we're so far, John. Why?'' \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' John shrugged. `` It's hard to see the truth before you come to face it. I've thought about this for years, and I knew the moment you pulled me from that canoe, that I would not be carried back.'' \n \n `` Stay with me,'' Fiona plead, her own voice sounded as if it came from other end of a very long tunnel. \n \n `` I'll always stay with you,'' John said. \n \n And he turned and sprang from the forest with the stride of a vivacious young man. One last time. Then Fiona's world was all water: the sweat on her forehead, the tears trailing down her face, the lump in her throat, and the sound -- loud as thunder -- of her husband diving into the river, plunging beneath. A tremor coursed through her body. She wanted to shout, but the air. It was too goddamn muggy, too hot. She collapsed to her knees, looked up, at the sun gaping through the forest canopy. Through her tears, it appeared brighter. \n \n The guard placed a hand on the small of her neck. He'd never known death, had he? Had he known love? \n \n `` Okay,'' the guard spoke warmly. He placed a soft finger beneath Fiona's chin and turned her head to look him in the eyes. `` Fountain?'' \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` I do n't sleep . '' He\/She said .\n","story":"\u201c I don \u2019 t sleep \u201d he said. \n \n When I came into the Seattle area for the first time I realized I never really became accustomed to the actual *scene* of Seattle. Sure, I saw the postcards and took a few trips down to UW in order to gain a sense of the atmosphere of the place where I will be living for the next for years, but looking at data through a weather balloon is much different that standing on the ground and looking at the rainstorm. And that is what I exactly did for a few minutes until I stumbled into one of the increasingly numerous coffee shops that I passed every few times. This coffee shop had a strange ironic name to it that I couldn \u2019 t pin down, and when I entered it had a sense of both comfort and estrangement, like you are visiting a brother that you knew for your entire lifetime but both of your own interests are completely at odds with one another. I ordered what I usually ordered at the Starbucks in Kansas City; a ~~Grande~~ Medium White Chocolate Mocha with extra shot of espresso. It came out in a few minutes, handed to me by a guy with way too many tattoos to glasses ratio. I picked a seat and stared out into the city street. \n \n I saw him when he walked across me. His face was completely wrecked; bags so big you would swear they were filled with the contents of a trip to Costco and eyes so bloodshot it put tweakers and crack addicts to shame. His hair was matted and unkempt, much like dreadlocks, only without the locks and only the dread. His clothing resembled much that of any other homeless Seattleite; northface jacket one size too big, shoes running shoes that never looked like they were run in a lifetime, and jeans that were just completely caked in mud. He entered into the coffeeshop reeking of marijuana, and he ordered a straight black coffee with a single sugar from the tattooed fella. He got his drink and sat down before I had a chance to react in a negative way. \n \n \u201c Hi, I \u2019 m Mark. \u201d He said. \n \n \u201c Hello, I \u2019 m Bothering \u201d I said back. \n \n \u201c I can see that you are new here, is it your first time visiting the emerald city? \u201d \n \n \u201c No, it \u2019 s been a few months since I last traveled here, but this time it \u2019 s actually here to stay. \u201d \n \n \u201c College? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah. UW, actually. \u201d \n He flashed a toothy smile that revealed the lack of dental work performed on him. \n \n \u201c Oh yeah? I used to go there! Alumni and all! \u201d \n \n \u201c Cool man. \u201d \n \n \u201c I got into the program on the backs of tons of scholarships, you know how that all felt like, right? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, and actually some of the scholarships really had me put through the ringer. You wouldn \u2019 t believe how many different things other places want you to do in order for them to give you money. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sure man. \u201d I drank some more of my coffee. It was much better than Starbucks, I \u2019 ll give that. \n \n \u201c Yeah, like this one company wanted to try out a new sleep medicine for a couple thousand dollars. As with any serious cash I definitely had no inclination not to say no. And that \u2019 s when I \u201d \n \n He stopped. I didn \u2019 t notice the shift from noise to silence until I looked over to my left. His face completely relaxed, his bags were completely gone and his eyes stared blackly into the jacket that I was wearing. I wanted to say something, but by that point ( and my experience with other homeless people in KC ), I didn \u2019 t want to set him off. He mumbled something incoherently when he perked up again. \n \n \u201c Hi! I \u2019 m mark, I don \u2019 t sleep! \u201d \n \n Funny, I would have never guessed. \n \n A pause between the conversations as I tried to digest what he was saying. Here I am, in a coffeeshop in someplace that I have no idea where I am, talking to a strange homeless guy about college. The fact that he shut up completely changed the tone of my voice from one of apathy to one of interest. I decided to ask \n \n \u201c What the he- yeah I saw that. You were talking about sleep studies when you decided to quiet down. I was wondering what that was. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh that? Don \u2019 t worry about my pauses. It \u2019 s a thing that happens to many people that can \u2019 t sleep. Apparently since the body still needs sleep people like me go into what are known as microsleep, stages in which my brain completely goes blank as my mind tries to sleep for 60 odd seconds. Because of this I can \u2019 t even drive, much less afford the insurance premiums that i got jacked up once they all knew of this. It was actually why I decided to start that sleep study that I told you! \u201d \n \n He continues, and I listen. The coffee in my hands was half drunk, his was untouched. \n \n \u201c So what the company did was that they took em and five other people into a room in order to study the effects of group sleep on the body. The room was pretty wild I \u2019 ll tell you, they got it so that it dampens every sound that comes into the room. I couldn \u2019 t even hold a good conversation with other people because the dampening in that room prevented me from raising my voice too high. The big wigs at the study made us sleep in beds that were arranged in a star pattern and played some white noise in order to help us sleep. As I decided to sleep I was \u201d \n \n He entered into what he called another stage of microsleep. His eyes started staring into his own coffee as I wait for him to come out of it. I drink some more of my coffee, enjoying the sights of what Seattle has to offer from the coffeeshop. \n \n \u201c Finn, Julien, Cyril, Colbert, Lopez \u201d \n \n I look back at him expecting another section of his adventures in the sleep study lab. I don \u2019 t see that, I see him staring into his coffee looking like a man that had taken in thousands of dollars to Vegas only to find himself within the hour scrambling for change on the strip right beside a cheap prostitute. The shift in vocal tone completely muffled the coffeeshop that I was in. Even the tattooed barista stopped cleaning glasses in order to wonder what the heck went on as Mark continues to repeat those five names. I scoot a little bit away from him, scraping the floor and seemingly waking Mark up from his routine. \n \n \u201c Hi! I \u2019 m Mark! Though I think I was already talking to you about somethi- Jesus Christ are you alright? \u201d \n \n I didn \u2019 t notice it as first so I looked at my reflection in the window. I looked scared. \n \u201c No, no don \u2019 t worry about me \u201d I said \n \n Mark replied \u201c Dang I never knew that my episodes could scare someone like that. I know that sometimes it freaks people out but you, you were looking about ready to either fight me or run straight out of the coffeeshop into the street. \u201d \n \n \u201c Ye- \u201c \n \n \u201c *Screaming. * \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah \u201d \n \n There were different routes I could have taken with this conversation now. He gave me one before I had the chance to respond. \n \n \u201c Okay man. Where was I, the sleep study thing and all that I do remember\u2026 I think I was at the part about the nightmares \u201d \n \n \u201c nightmares? \u201d \n \n \u201c Nightmares. Yeah. Well, not so much as nightmares as just one single long dream. I \u2019 m guessing they wanted us to confirm a thing about white noise and the effects on people. Or maybe it was the shared experience of dreaming or something like that. But anyway when I started dreaming I found myself in a circular room with other people sitting around me. I realized that ( a ) I was dreaming and that ( b ) these were the other five people in the sleep study. There was some murmurs between us on what to do next when one of them, Cyril, decided that we should all tell each other our names. \u201d \n \n \u201c Finn, Julien, Cyril, Colbert, Lopez, right? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, how did- I said it in my microsleep phase, didn \u2019 t I. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay sure, all six of us exchanged names and talked about our lives for the couple of hours that we were within the sleep study group. We explained our lives and our aspirations, and by the time that we should have all woken up we knew quite a bit of everyone else. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sure \u201d I drank the rest of my coffee. His looks cold but I don \u2019 t care, he looks too focused to even think about drinking. \n \n \u201c Except, by the time that we thought we were to wake up. Nobody did. \u201d \n \n He continued his story, looking less energetic as he went on \n \n \u201c Lopez realized it first when he decided to go back and wake up. He did all the regular stuff people do to wake up. Slapping himself, lifting up his eyelids, poking and prodding himself, everything. Nothing worked. Soon everyone decided to get in on the whole waking craze, with the assumption that when one of us wakes that one person can wake the rest of us up and we can all go home. Don \u2019 t take this as me saying that I hated it here, I actually liked the company. But the relative isolation really did make us itching to get us out of here. I and Cyril and all the rest were all at it when we heard an echoing voice talking about test results. And \u201d \n \n He paused again, I prodded \n \n \u201c And\u2026? \u201d \n \n \u201c And the voice started congratulating on falling asleep so fast, only five minutes before everyone knocked out, he said. \u201d \n \n He definitely looked winded out and I wanted nothing more than to end it so I decided to ask the question that was tugging at my mind. \n \n \u201c So the reason why you couldn \u2019 t sleep was\u2026 \u201d \n \n \u201c The fact that, at this point in my life, I had already mentally spent half of it sleeping for 8 \u2018 hours \u2019. \u201d \n \n I decided to end it there and pay my respects and condemnation for whatever practitioner cursed him with this situation. He only looked at me and nodded in agreement, and I set off back into Seattle. \n\n"}

I would have been highly disappointed if the great acclaimed spirit Carla Lancester had not stayed true to her word.'' \n \n I wave. `` Good bye Carla.'' \n \n `` Fare thee well, John.'' \n \n As I make my way across the parking lot, I could see a lithe petite woman giving me a cheery wave from the back of my eye. \n \n EDIT: Formatting. \n \n EDIT 2: More formatting. \n \n\n"}

I lay here, in absolute disbelief, `` How have I allowed myself to not sleep?''. Finals week was never supposed to be this hard. I get out of bed, and notice that my psychology text is laying open on the floor; I think- `` I must have studied at some point''. I get up to go to the bathroom- which felt like the longest walk I've ever taken; who knew that a mere ten feet could feel like an eternity. \n \n I get to the bathroom and look up into the mirror- I look terrible. Almost all of the color has left my face and I have big enough dark circles to be a raccoon. I splash my face with some water and look back into the mirror- someone was behind me. I turn behind me and they'res nothing. Just the wall that separates the door from it's hinge and nothing else. I think to myself again, `` I really need to get some sleep.'' \n \n As a college student, not many people get much sleep. You're lucky if you get more than 4 hours a night if you're an engineering major like me. Most of my nights are fueled by red bull and adderal; just enough to keep me on edge to study my best. Now, it's 2:30 AM, and I have n't stepped away from my desk for an entire hour. I look to my right and see that I've just finished the last of my redbull. So, I left to get more. \n \n The nearest gas station is n't that far from my apartment. I live on the east side of New York- they'res a bodega on almost every corner. I'm a little worried now though, I have n't left my place this late in the night. East village is quite the scene past 1 am- and I try not to leave after midnight due to my ex being robbed right down the street from the bar we used to frequent on Wednesdays. I round the next corner and hear a faint whisper: \n \n `` Eric''. \n \n I have a little heart attack, because it's a bit eerie out right now- and I'm not in a well-lit area, but the bodega is n't that far from where i'm at. I can actually see the sign from where I'm at. \n \n Moments pass and i'm in the store. I walk over to the fridges and see that they'res plenty of red bull. I grab four. I close the door to the cooler, and behind me in my reflection is the same person I saw in my bathroom. This time, I book it; I run faster than i've ever ran before back to my apartment- did n't even pay for the red bull. I just ran. I turn the corner and I go to grab the keys to open my door and there it is. The person that's been following me all night. The figure raises it's arm and curls what looks to be it's fingers. I feel a strong force overcome the lower half of my body. I'm stuck; I ca n't move. \n \n The figure approaches me in slow persuit- I ca n't walk. It's as if I've been frozen to the ground by nature's wrath. As the figure draws closer, I start to feel a sense of frigid air surround my body. We now stand face to face; this creature takes down it's black veil surrounding it's face and I see what looks to be a man in his mid 70's, but not weak. His skin was the texture of rock, and from what I could see his mouth was covered by a large amount of ice. He snaps his fingers and his mouth is revealed. He speaks to me, \n \n `` Eric, you have to listen to me'' \n \n at this moment in time, I'm freaking out. I'm wondering why I ca n't move. I reply, `` WHO ARE YOU''. \n \n The man looks at me for a moment, then runs his hand down the side of my face. \n `` If only you knew'' \n \n The man then draws what looks to be a handgun from his pocket, and puts it in my hand. \n \n `` You must end your life, Eric. Right here- right now. I ca n't explain to you why- but if you do n't, you will live your life like me from this moment on'' \n \n I'm thinking to myself now that this is either a sick joke- or I'm delusional. I do n't know what to do. I see this frigid old bag in front of me, then hands me a gun and says, `` kill yourself''. I must be going crazy; my mind is a mile a minute and I'm going insane. I do what I seem would be the best option; I draw the gun and nail a shot right between his two eyes. The man falls to the ground, and I am suddenly freed. \n \n Now, I'm running back to my apartment with god speed. I ca n't believe what had just happened. I pick up the phone and call my mom, the only person that would answer at this hour; \n \n `` MOM, you need to listen to me. I just killed a man''. \n \n My mom is in shock, she replies, \n \n `` Eric, you're kidding. Go back to sleep'' \n \n I instantaneously start screaming at her \n `` MOM I'm NOT KIDDI --'' \n \n I look down and see that my feet are turning to stone; the air around me is cold. I drop the phone and watch myself turn into what is the exact description that the man had told me. It started with my feet, then onward with the rest of my body. My mouth is then covered with a thick patch of ice. \n \n `` I feel, invincible'' \n \n I leave my apartment, and stomp over my phone. I am now what seems to be the next incarnation of Jack Frost.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] After suffering amnesia , you go on a quest to discover your past . It is a much darker tale than you once thought .\n","story":"Light. Dark. Colors. Shades. \n \n Everything swarms and swallows my body as my eyes flicker open. The darkness pushing on the edges of light seeming to be in an ever constant battle more futile by the growing minute. As my surroundings zero in and become clear all of a sudden one thing becomes clear. Everything seems so new to me as if I was taking my first breath. I began trying to access memories and there was nothing. No family, friends, schools or jobs everything seemed so vacant. A slight panic began to fill my chest as I was grasping for something tangible. Where did it all begin? Why ca n't I remember anything? I thought to myself, and decided the next step would be to figure out where I am. An alley way laying in, based on the smell, week old garbage and a couple feet to my right is a strange woman wearing a yellow summer dress that exposes her smooth arms with a modest cut just above the knees. Her skin is a beautiful sun kissed olive the imperfections of her tan lines shine through on her right shoulder due to a slight fold of the strap. She does n't use makeup which accented her natural beauty all the more. The brown thin belt gently hugging her hips and white headband snugly holding her long curly brunette hair back give her an even more calm sentiment then I first noticed. Her presence eased the panic so I reached out. \n \n `` Um, excuse me,'' I started, `` Where am I?'' \n \n She stood their statuesque. Not a sound or a movement not even the raising and lowering of her chest. I shut my eyes and reopen them trying to gather myself, upon opening them the familiar battle of light versus dark floods back and the clarity returns. Only this time the peaceful woman is gone. I conduct a quick scan of my surroundings. It is night time and the alley is suddenly very empty except for myself and this odd pile of trash bags. The building we are lying against has no doors in sight and the fence in front of me has no openings. The light pole dead center of the alley evenly lit everything. I kept wondering where this trash came from. When from above I am smacked by a recently filled bag of trash I felt the warmth of certain parts and the cool liquid of others pressing against me as it rolled to my left. I look up to see a guy pulling out one of his headphones, `` I'm sorry man I did n't see you there. You really should n't lay in a pile of trash though'' he added. Just then I see the girl just behind his shoulder standing there as still as before. I ignored the man and scurried to my feet. I backed towards the fence to get a better view of the two. His back was towards me now with both headphones in he was walking away. `` Hey, how did you get up there?'' Again nothing. Again gone. \n \n I turned right headed towards the busiest of the two directions. I had noticed heavy foot traffic and cars passing this way and I was hoping somebody could help me. I emerged from the alley to see the light really fighting against the dark even pushing it back. The youth filled the streets with joy, bright neon lights plagued the signs on this street. Inns, pubs, piano bars, restaurants all bustling with the interactions of joyful spirits. Just then an epiphany. I reached into my trouser pocket and found a wallet. I found an ID. `` Gerald Arthur,'' Great sadness filled me holding my ID, `` Gerald Arthur FREEZE!'' I turned and saw a woman in an all blue uniform with a shield above her heart yelling to me. In the reflection of the light on her glasses I saw a figure behind me waving. It was the girl and she took off running. Almost out of instinct I follow. The three way chase is zigzagging in out of the youth that filled the street. There hurried conversations sent an alarming feeling down my spine. They must all be talking about me. BUT WHY? Just then the girl turns right down a street out of my sight. I turn right on the same street still hearing the officer yelling behind me. Again gone. `` DAMMIT!'' I loosed in anger. The panic is growing again. She is going to be here any minute. I keep on moving down the street. I make a left onto a less eventful street one that the darkness seemed to be winning against the light. I hid in the shadows and kept moving. I heard behind me people telling the officer where I had went. And thought to myself they should mind their own business. She sees the shine of my orange outfit in the dark and again yells, `` FREEZE!'' Naturally I did n't I kept moving. Only this time I see her. Her standing there waving for me to move faster. She heads right and again I make a right off this street and downhill my pace became swifter as physics took over and I embraced it. She's gone again but I feel that I am heading the right direction. The busy nightlife dying in the background only to be replaced by my heavy breath and the eerie stillness of the residential district I was entering. This nagging feeling of familiarity began to weigh me down and my pace slowed it could have been the evening out of the pavement to a flat surface or the fact that I am getting tired but I knew better. There she was and she knew better. \n \n The officer was still in pursuit but the distance between us had grown and I was relieved by that. I make a right, a left then another right. She was persistent I will give her that. But I was in an instinctual mode knowing every nook and cranny of this neighborhood. Just as I was feeling like I was getting close to where I was leading she appeared again the girl waving me on and pointing at something with joy. Just then I noticed a house to my right that slowed me in my tracks. It was a large two story with a wraparound porch and one rocking chair on either side of the front entrance everything was so symmetrical the light and darkness displaying it prominently in the night even the yellow caution tape that sealed it off from illegal entrance. My nagging feeling turned into dread. Why is this important. I felt my body come to a complete stop. I approached the house. It had a date of three weeks prior labeled on it. Images began to fill my head of a woman and child screaming. A loud deafening noise rang in my mind. The officer was nearing again yelling for me, `` STOP Gerald just STOP,'' but her voice elicited a flight response from me. My feet began to pound the pavement as the foot race intensified. Another twenty minutes passed of running with no sign of the girl nothing at all but familiar surroundings came and went around me. Why was this officer so intense? She should have given up by now I thought to myself. Not an ounce of quit in her. I made a right again. The girl appeared once more in the cemetery standing there this time in-between two tombstones in the distance. They were two newer looking tombstones this was easy to pick up on because they were n't as weather worn as the others. Again my body came to a stop. My eyes settled upon the names. And tears spilled from my eyes. I looked up at the girl and noticed a smaller girl holding onto her yellow dress peering around from behind her. She was terrified of me they both were but they both still looked at me with such loving eyes. And I knew why. I know it all. \n \n Michelle Arthur. Here lies a loving mother taken from us too soon. \n \n Annabelle Arthur. Here lies a daughter and a light extinguished before her time. \n \n The officer came up on me gun drawn, `` Do n't move Gerald. You son of a bitch do n't move.'' I continued sobbing and did n't acknowledge her. `` Say something Gerald. Say something.'' My silence continued I just could n't bring myself to turn and face her because I knew who she was. `` I do n't know how you escaped but I am not letting you get away.'' She said then the tears she was holding back began to fill her eyes. `` I loved you. You were my son. How could you have done this to my family. My daughter and granddaughter were taken to soon. Because of you. You son of a bitch. I trusted you and you did this with that trust. Well I hope you are happy with yourself. I hope you are proud. This will be your legacy. A murder of the things he loves. A destroyer of things that are beautiful and true. I hate you. And I hope all manners of evil plague you from here on out you bastard.'' \n \n `` I know this wo n't help any but I was n't myself that night. I had no recollection of it until this night. I am so sorry. So completely and utterly sorry for everything I've done to our family. If only there were something I could do to make this right.'' I wailed to her. \n \n `` There is something.'' She whispered. \n \n `` Anything.'' I pleaded. \n \n `` YOU CAN DIE!'' She exclaimed. \n \n That familiar loud deafening noise rang throughout the cemetery. As I grabbed for my heart. \n \n She ran over and held me in her arms crying more hysterically than before. `` I'm so sorry. I thought this would help me but it did n't. Please do n't die she bartered.'' \n \n With my final breath and action I delivered an, `` I love you.'' Trying to fake a smile for her. \n \n The darkness engulfed all the light that was left. In the cemetery, in my eyes, in her soul and in the world. It seems that no matter how hard the light tries to brighten its surroundings it always finds the darkness is there first waiting for it. \n\n"}

Since middle school I slowly began to realize that I do n't believe in your God, I do n't believe Jesus died for anyone's `` sins'' and I do n't believe that hating gays does anyone any good.

I'm pro-choice and I'm pro- everything that you hate and can not believe people could ever like. I'm gay, bisexual to be exact, I've had sexual relationships better than any of yours ever were or could be because I am not afraid to talk about it or anything else with my friends who you think are such a bad influence on me. All they've done is bounced my own thoughts back at me and exposed me to their parents and their lives- by doing that they helped me realize just how much I can not stand to live with you because their parents are so much more open and accepting that it makes me want to cry because of how much I felt boxed in and trapped and stuck living a life that is n't mine. \n \n Yes, you've both done a lot for me.

Hate the sinner, love the sin is such utter bullshit that I can not see how it could ever make sense.

I may end up with a female partner or a male partner but either way I will still be bisexual and if you will only acknowledge me in my entirety when I'm with a man, then I can not accept your support because it wo n't be unconditional like a parent's love and support is supposed to. \n \n I ca n't be in contact with you if you refuse to recognize that I do n't believe in God.

We tried to escape to the farmlands. To get away from the smell of burning rubble and the sound of screams. We were safe in a barn for a few weeks. The owners had blown their brains out with their last rifle rounds. The guns were as useless as clubs, but they left behind machetes, pitchforks, axes. Left behind the animals, too.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] All mankind lives on floating continents that slowly orbit the planet . Continents might come in contact with each other once in hundreds or thousands of years . Contact is about to be made between two very different continents with very different societies .\n","story":"I stood on the jagged cliff edge and watched the slowly approaching landmass with interest. My friend Saul joined me, his red cloak flapping in the breeze. I pulled my own cloak tighter around my body, the blue material trapping my body heat so that I did n't feel as cold. At my feet, my terrier Sam was sitting patiently, looking out at the stars above. \n \n'How long do you think it'll be?' I said. \n \n Saul gazed out at the dark continent beyond the cliff.'I do n't know, Sarah,' he sighed.'They're saying it could be here within a day, possibly sooner. It all depends on the way the gravity fields interact. This sort of thing has n't happened in centuries, you know. There's no precedent.' \n \n I shivered, but not because of the cold. The continent that was heading towards us was a mystery. It used to be a large chunk of Brazil, according to the history archives, but that was all we knew about it. None of our technology was sufficiently powerful to scan its surface in any great detail, so we generally had to rely on sight alone. \n \n I looked down at the ocean-covered planet far below. We were floating right at the edge of the atmosphere, around twenty kilometres above sea level. Nobody really knew how we managed to breath, or even how it was warm enough for us to survive up here. Some convoluted combination of powerful gravitational fields and sunlight being magnified by gases, our scientists said. \n \n And in all those hundreds of years we had been up here, we had never come into contact with any of the other continents. Britain had come close, once, when it went spinning past our `` bow'' with Ireland in tow. We had gotten some good close-up scans of the surface of France when it flew past a few years ago as well, but that was as close as we had ever been to the mysterious societies that inhabited our neighbouring landmasses. \n \n I was feeling rather excited, despite myself. This was the biggest thing that had ever happened in my life, and probably would be the biggest thing I or any of my generation would see in our lifetimes. When our experts first calculated the trajectory of the other continent and concluded that it would be coming towards us, I was one of the first volunteers for the exploration expedition. \n \n We had been training for almost a year and a half now. Along with the other twenty volunteers, I was now proficient in fieldcraft, exploration, survival, and I could put a hole through the bullseye of a target at sixty metres with my rifle. It was strapped tightly across my back right now, a comforting hard piece of death against my shoulder blades. \n \n'We should head back,' said Saul, shouldering his own rifle. He was one of the other volunteers for the expedition.'We both need to get some sleep. Got a big day tomorrow.' \n \n I nodded and turned to follow him. I stole one more glance at the distant continent before turning my back on it. \n \n Soon, we would be exploring a whole new world. \n \n *** \n \n I was woken from my slumber by a violent shaking all around me. I sat up in my bunk, almost knocking myself out on the bunk above. I swung my legs out of bed and stood up, already fully clothed in my survival suit. I picked up my helmet, rifle and backpack from where they hung on the wall. I began to run down the corridor, but stumbled as the ground shook again. \n \n'What the-?' Saul suddenly bumped into me. \n \n'What's happening?' I said. \n \n'I think we've just bumped into the other continent,' he replied.'Let's go! Quick!' \n \n I dashed out of the building after him. Our transport, a large truck on the edge of the compound, was already half-full. I climbed aboard, as did Saul. Two minutes later, we were on our way towards the edge of our world. Our leader, Harry Santiago, sat on the tailgate, as he briefed us. \n \n'Right, we're currently rubbing right up against this thing,' he shouted over the noise of the truck's engine.'It came in a lot faster than we were expecting. We're going to jump from the northwestern coast right down onto the surface. The experts are saying we've got about two days before the continents move apart again, so I want us in and out in less than twenty-four hours. Understood?' \n \n We all nodded. He looked out of the back of the truck.'Okay, helmets on, guys.' \n \n I fitted my helmet down over my buzz-cut military-style brown hair. The seals around the neck connected with my suit, creating a safe pressurised environment for me to breath in. My visor's HUD fired up, showing me radio channels, weaponry stats, everything I would need to know when we down there. \n \n The truck slowed to a stop, and we hustled out. I looked around. We were on the very edge of our world, a grassy plateau that ended in jagged rock. We spread out in a long line as we stepped up to the edge. I looked down past my booted feet. The view that was usually taken up with Earth and stars was now obscured by a cloudy green landscape. \n \n I gasped quietly. It was beautiful. \n \n'Right, on the count of three,' said Harry. He was standing to my right in the line. Saul was on my left. \n \n I clicked the controls on the back of my left glove. The thrusters on my backpack hummed into life, instantly making it feel lighter. I crouched, ready to jump. \n \n'Three.' \n \n I tensed myself. \n \n'Two.' \n \n I held my breath. \n \n'One.' \n \n We seemed to jump in slow motion. I saw the sunlight glint on the edge of my visor, the stars suddenly become clear and cold in the void, tiny droplets of moisture gathering on my suit. I felt my toes part company with the reassuring solidness of the ground I had been born and raised on. \n \n Then we were falling. I twisted my body into a graceful headlong dive, keeping my arms tucked in close at my sides. It was exhilarating, watching the rock of the cliff face flash past scant metres away. I angled my helmeted head downwards to see the continent below rushing up to meet me. \n \n About halfway down, we turned up our thrusters. They slowed our descent quickly as the landscape below expanded to fill a whole hemisphere of our world. I could make out huge jungles, twisting rivers, and small spirals of cloud curling slowly above it. It was the most glorious thing I had ever seen. \n \n In a matter of minutes, we closed the distance to a few thousand metres. I flipped upright at the same time as the others, directing the thrusters fully downwards. Harry aimed us towards a clearer part of the ground, where the trees gave way to thick undergrowth instead. \n \n I let my thrusters cut momentarily as we began our final approach, so that I was the first to land on the new continent. Now I knew what the first explorers must have felt like when they landed on the shores of America. It was a whole unexplored new world. \n \n The undergrowth was spongy and thick, like several carpets stacked on one another. I stamped around a little in delight as the rest of the team landed, their thrusters cooling down and folding back into their backpacks. Harry was already scanning the surroundings before he landed, turning his helmet sensors this way and that to see everything. \n \n'Atmosphere seems breathable,' he said.'Okay, guys, we need to-' \n \n He stopped suddenly and looked down. A four-foot long arrow was protruding from his chest, covered in gore and blood. For a moment, we all froze, unable to believe what we were seeing. \n \n Then Harry fell forward onto his face and the air was suddenly filled with arrows. \n \n I dived forwards onto my front as everyone either scattered into cover or raised their weapons, firing laser pulses and plasma fire into the trees. Two more were pierced by the flying wooden projectiles before I had even clicked the safety off on my own rifle. \n \n'No.' \n \n I looked around. Saul had his hand on my arm.'Do n't shoot,' he said.'Do n't give them a reason to kill you. Just get up and run when I give the signal.' \n \n He was always a bit of a humanitarian, was Saul. It was one of the reasons he had become our expedition's medic. I breathed in slowly. Okay. I could do this. \n \n I bumped helmets with him as a way of saying farewell. Then I jumped up and ran. Oh, how I ran. The months of training had honed my body, and I cleared several metres before the first arrows even began to fly in my direction. \n \n Then I was in the trees, pushing my way past branches and leaping over roots. The sounds of battle behind me faded, until I was completely alone. I looked over my shoulder to check. \n \n Big mistake. I tripped over a root and fell flat on my face, my rifle flying from my grasp. \n \n When I looked up again, there was a pair of large yellow eyes looking at me.\n"}

Why not immortality? Or super-healing like Wolverine, or Deadpool? But the power to make people mute until their name was uttered had proved to be more effective than she'd thought it would be. \n \n Take this fratbro, for instance. He'd been able to make people vomit by saying the word `` weaksauce''. It'd been a simple matter of following behind him, and muttering `` weaksauce'' under her breath, until she'd got the timing right. \n \n This was just a small victory, though. Everything was quickly turning to shit. \n \n It was exactly three days since whatever had happened, had happened. The first day and a half had wiped out a significant amount of people, as far as she could tell. She'd been unfortunate enough to be in the city where some asshole got the power to explode without being harmed. It had taken a team of someone being able to turn people blind while maintaining eye contact with them, someone able to create rope traps out of thin air, and someone with the guts to actually kill someone else to take that asshole down. \n \n Unfortunately for the would-be heroes, the exploding asshole had been standing next to someone whose power was to make other people's powers manifest themselves when they died. The whole thing had turned out to be more or less of a wash, but at least the exploding asshole was gone now. \n \n As she surveyed the street in front of her, she noticed something odd in the display window of a computer store. A monitor had turned itself on, and the picture of a vaguely familiar girl appeared on it. Once the picture had solidifed, the monitor turned itself inside out, and suddenly the girl was standing inside the shop. Huh. \n \n That was useful. Travelling over tv waves? Through wiring? Maybe over the internet? \n \n While she would n't have minded that kind of power, she'd still not gotten the shortest end of the stick. With billions of people suddenly getting unique powers, some had been hilarious. Some had been awful. She'd seen a man turn himself inside out... Unfortunately, his power had not covered being able to survive that. \n \n While pondering her next move, a blast of sound and fury caught her attention. \n \n `` Oh God..'' \n \n In the distance, a mushroom cloud was forming. \n \n Before she had time to react, the shockwave had thrown her body - along with whoever else was close by - like so many ragdolls.\n"}

The waiting room had a standard dentist's office waiting room look, with plain brown walls and uncomfortable green seats. The familiarity of the situation was something that Dan had n't pictured when he had thought of the end of the world. He was a sucker for explosions, meteors, and general mayhem, and the reality of the situation was so pedestrian that he was a little disappointed. Sure, the Earth would eventually become a Hellish landscape with storms so fierce that they would make Katrina look like a light breeze, but the climate was sure taking its sweet time getting there. Not that he was complaining, obviously. It was just that a small part of him had never gotten over his boyhood fantasies, and he had expected something *epic*. \n \n He just had not expected it to be so bureaucratic. He woke up to the alerts blaring through any available speaker - the T.V. that he had turned off, his phone, the microwave for God's sake - the generic newscaster voice saying that this was not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill, and he went to wake up his kids. He was already thinking of safe places to hide from what he had assumed was a tornado, when the voice elaborated.'Please evacuate. Get to the nearest launch pad. Launch pad locations are on the official white house website.'' and so on. He opened his daughter's door to find them already awake, hiding in the closet. Gloria, the eldest, was consoling her younger sister, Alexa. \n \n `` Come on girls. We've got to get out of here.'' \n \n `` What's going on?'' \n \n He looked into their naive young faces, and he did n't have the heart to tell them that he wished he could ask somebody that very same question. \n \n `` There must be a storm coming. We've got to get somewhere safe.'' He said it halfheartedly, and he could tell that they were n't satisfied with the answer, but they got out of the closet. He forced them to get ready just as if they were going to school, while he pulled up the white house website on his phone. The home page of the website had been replaced by a paragraph of text under large, bold letters saying'Climate Worsening - Evacuate immediately'. The text gave a simple run down of the plan from there, with a link to a map with launch site locations. He started to pack his things. \n \n The nearest rocket to him was a couple of hours away, in Texas. He had driven the kids, who fell back to sleep almost immediately, laying on the pillows that they had brought along. If they had been older and less sleepy, they would have seen the implication behind all of the things packed in the car with them, but as it was they just thought that they were having a sleepover in a bunker, or some other place safe from a humongous storm. Dan brainstormed ways to tell them the truth as he drove. They were pretty adventurous girls, and he did n't think it would be too hard to sell them on what was about to happen. \n \n So then they sat, in a waiting room full of similar families. Kids and adults alike out of the loop, not even aware until now that the United States had this sort of technology, much less that they would need it any time soon. It was getting to be about daylight, and the girls woke up. \n \n `` Is this the shelter Daddy?'' Gloria looked around the room in disappointment. She, like Dan, was often disappointed with the reality of things. \n \n `` No girls. It turns out that this storm is too big.

His mouth felt dry, chalky even, as if he had swallowed a mouthful of flour. \n \n He felt the headache coming on in waves of throbbing pain radiating from the back of his head, forward towards his eyeballs, which in turn were having a difficult time focusing on his immediate surroundings. \n Squinting, he once more pulled up his bloodied sleeve, wincing as the caked blood caught and sent a jolt of pain up his arm. \n \n *RUN* \n \n Gaz knew the feeling, he had woken up in a similar state of drowsiness exactly ten years ago to the day, on the morning of his tenth birthday. Except back then- what seemed like centuries ago- his Awakening had been greeted by a chilled glass of water and two translucent pills. \n \n His mother had been sitting on the side of the bed, gently tilting his head forward to help him as he had tried to regain his bearings. She had kissed his clammy forehead, and then, with her sweet nurturing voice had said: \n \n \u201c Congratulations sweetheart, I \u2019 m so very proud of you. Drink this, slowly, and don \u2019 t worry honey, it will pass soon, I promise \u201d \n \n He remembered her flipping his pillow over, fluffing it by striking it twice firmly, and setting his head back into the cool, blissfully soft cushion, just as a deep regenerating sleep had begun to take over. \n \n But that was then. \n \n There would be no glass of chilled water to help soothe away the pain today. Not unless he scrounged some credits up, and made his way two buildings over to the Automated Provisioning Machine. Something which in this state, was purely unthinkable. \n \n And certainly there would be no translucent pills. Sure, the A.P.M. probably had one or two kits in stock, but Gaz wouldn \u2019 t be able to afford one, not until next month anyways- and by then this headache will have possibly killed him. \n \n He slowly swiveled his legs over the side of the bunk, and let his feet rest on the cool metal grate for a few moments. \n \n The flickering neon light outside the window was buzzing its usual monotone hum, the yellow light filtering in through the chips and dents in the otherwise closed blinds. Well, at least he had thought to shut them last night. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 d think that with ten years to prepare for my next Awakening, I would have planned this morning slightly better \u201d he thought to himself. But then, planning had never been Gaz \u2019 s forte- isn \u2019 t that why he was living in this shit hole to begin with? \n \n He carefully tried to calculate how many steps it would take for him to reach the rusty tap in the corner of his rented pad. He figured if he could at least make it within arm \u2019 s reach before succumbing to the pain, he could always crawl the rest of the way. \n \n Planting his feet firmly, well as firmly as he could manage, Gaz willed himself up, staggered a few haphazard steps forwards, and face planted just short of the tap. \n \n He clearly had underestimated how incredibly off his motor skills were. \n \n Hoisting himself up awkwardly using the pedestal of the sink for support, Gaz suddenly was overcome with a wave of stomach-churning nausea. He forced his face into the sink and vomited a putrid stream of foul smelling liquid, mostly bile if he had to guess. \n \n As the waves of pain in his head increased in droves, they seemed to amplify with each pulse. \n \n Darkness begin to creep in from the sides of his vision, he yanked the tap open and managed to swallow two large gulps of tepid water before the darkness overcame him and sent him crashing back to the ground. \n \n Gaz woke up some time later to the sound of loud, muffled, yelling coming from somewhere in the building. He tried to move his arm into view again but yanked himself up with a start, as he was immediately aware of a feeling of wetness in his clothes. \n \n The tap was open, spilling water out over the edge of the sink, and water had begun to pool on the floor. \n \n \u201c Shit! \u201d \n \n He slowly got up, groaning as he felt the remnants of the crippling headache lurking right behind his temples. \n \n He carefully sloshed a few steps forward and reached over to shut off the tap when his bloodied arm came into view. \n \n *RUN* \n \n Whatever Future-Self had wanted to communicate, Gaz wished he would have done so on paper. Maybe with some additional details as to what he was meant to be running from and where to? Let alone when. \n \n Timing is everything they say, right? \n \n As he strained his memory to try and remember anything else from the night before, the yelling became much louder, most definitely emanating from somewhere on his floor. \n \n He heard a loud series of bangs down the hallway followed by the instantly recognizable, deep digitized voice of a New TriCity Enforcer. \n \n \u201c OPEN THE DOOR NOW CITIZEN! \u201d \n \n What was going on out there? Gaz briefly considered opening the door to see what the commotion was about but very quickly decided that would probably be just the latest in a series of terrible decisions. \n \n His mind unfocused again as he tried to make sense of the Message. \n \n Everyone was taught early on that each Awakening was meant to bring a sense of illumination, purpose, direction. \n \n Gaz felt nothing but confusion, distress, and anxiety. \n \n No one would never know what their Future-Self \u2019 s exact Message was meant to be, as that was not passed to them. Rather, similar to a dream you \u2019 ve just woken up from where everything seems so clear just moments before, it all whisks away within moments, and very little- if anything- is retained. \n \n It is said that certain people, the *Gifted*, are able to retain the quasi-entirety of their Message on Awakening. Except no one had seen a *Gifted* in the past few centuries. \n \n Gaz wasn \u2019 t asking to be *Gifted*, he didn \u2019 t need to remember everything from his Future-Self \u2019 s Message, but maybe a few extra words or context wouldn \u2019 t have hurt either. \n \n Three loud BANGs on his door in rapid succession jolted him out of his stream of consciousness. \n \n Clearly the Enforcers hadn \u2019 t found whatever or whoever they were looking for. \n \n \u201c OPEN THE DOOR CITIZEN! \u201d bellowed the ominous voice. \n \n \u201c Ehrmm, sure just one second, I just need to get some pan- \u201c \n \n \u201c OPEN IT IMMEDIATELY OR WE WILL BE FORCED TO BREAK IT DOWN \u201d \n \n As he pondered how rude it was of the Enforcer to interrupt him, Gaz \u2019 s eye caught sight of a half-open metal suitcase laying on the floor at the foot of his bunk. \n \n \u201c CITIZEN THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING, OPEN THE DOOR OR FACE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES \u201d \n \n Gaz barely registered what the Enforcer was saying. \n \n Time seemed to slow down to where he was suddenly acutely aware of his heart beat, breathing, and the perspiration gliding down the side of his face. \n \n The suitcase was full to the brim of brand new, shiny credits. \n \n He had never seen the suitcase in his life. Let alone that amount of credits. \n \n \u201c PER MANDATE 6474-2 OF TRI-CITY ENFORCEMENT, ENTRY AUTHORIZED \u201d \n \n At the edges of his peripheral, Gaz once again saw the cryptic message on his arm: \n \n *RUN* \n \n Synapses fired. \n \n Suddenly it connected. \n \n Gaz grasped the side of the railing of his bunk and vaulted over to where the suitcase lay, just as the door gave way with a sickening crunch. \n \n Without giving it a second thought, he grabbed the suitcase and crashed through the blinds and glass window onto the fire escape. \n \n \u201c STOP YOUR FLIGHT CITIZEN OR LETHAL FORCE WILL BE USED PER MANDATE 8373-2 OF TRI-CITY ENFORCEMENT \u201d \n \n Thank the Mandates. \n \n In the time it took for the Enforcer to rattle off the Mandate number, Gaz had managed to slide down the ladder to the dark street below, just as the first bullet ricocheted off the rung above his head. \n \n Suitcase in hand, sirens wailing, the caustic smell of the nearby sewer exacerbating the already suffocating thickness of the city air, he glanced once more down at his arm as he took a leaping step down the side alleyway. \n \n *RUN* \n \n He \u2019 d have to figure out why he had forsaken his arm over using paper at a later time, but in his head Gaz gave his Future-Self a well-deserved high-five. \n \n Gaz may not be *Gifted* but quite suddenly he sure felt a surge of enlightenment. \n \n Now he just needed to figure out how to get out of the City alive... \n\n"}

And *THEY*,'' he said while pointing at the sign, `` throwed tomatoes at me! I could n't even get them to listen to me! You really, really screwed up Dad.

Adios!'' \n \n Jehova stared in bewilderment as the missed prayers kept coming in. `` Oh, and by the way,'' Jesus said as he turned around a final time. `` You might want to have a word with Lucy. Because he *did* have some success. Check out his improved Hell. It's busier over there than it ever was in Heaven...'' \n \n Baffled, Jehova turned around and glanced over at Zeus. It now occured to him that he looked tired. `` You're lucky, Jehova. Apparently they all stopped believing in me after your son stepped in.'' He showed his phone: fifty missed prayers and a few voicemails too unintelligible to understand. Jehova sighed. This was going to be a long week...\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] After the ball , the kingdom experiences a fad for glass slippers .\n","story":"The ball was a month ago and all the shoe stores had started carrying glass shoes as that had become the craze since word of the prince's quest to find the woman with the matching shoe had spread throughout all of the kingdom. It seemed glass was the only footwear to be found on the feet of royalty and peasants alike. There were even whispers of making glass boots too, apparently, even the men were getting swept away in the frenzy. The prince was so insistent he decreed for the slipper to be inspected by every shoemaker in the kingdom to determine where it had originated from- perhaps a sorceress had transformed an ordinary slipper into glass. Once identified, woe be to the poor shoemaker were he to be unable to recall it's purchaser. \n \n Cinderella's step-sisters were clumsy and their insistence at wearing the delicate things was cause for much frustration on her part. Not only were her days filled with the usual- mopping, sweeping, laundry, etc, - but now she must clean and redress each girls' pair of feet as they kept breaking the slippers and getting cut. Additionally, as these girls were next-level crazy, she was making increasingly frequent trips to various shoe stores to replace the broken ones. Each new pair was a size bigger than previous as the swelling of the feet never went down. \n \n It was for this reason that Cinderella could be found perusing the shoemaker's spoils this Tuesday morning. As a further demonstration of the effects the notorious missing shoe was having on the kingdom, shoemakers and glassblowers are now sharing their trade's secrets with each other as means to achieve the highest quality products. They now set up shop next to each other for convenience. \n \n The shoemaker, Sir Fjor, seemed out of sorts this morning, he could barely manage a nod in Cinderella's direction when she approach his merchandise. He was standing beyond his crystal shoes, barely visible under the canopy overhead. \n \n `` Henry? You look so upset? What has happened?'' \n \n He was shaking and he jumped at the sound of her voice, visibly bringing him back to the marketplace setting, he had clearly been elsewhere. `` I-, I made this. It was me.'' \n \n `` You did?'' Cinderella could n't breathe. She had been busy since the ball trying to convince herself that she could n't possibly be the only dame to attend wearing glass slippers. Surely another girl, clumsy as she was, could have lost her's as easily as Cinderella had. Surely. Surely. \n \n `` I received it only just this morning by courier.'' He turned to meet her gaze. `` Cinderella, I can not recall making this shoe, silk or not. But there is my trademark. I'll deny it's mine, the mark is smudged anyway. The next shoemaker can give it a look.'' \n \n `` Sir Fjor, may I look at it?'' Cinderella felt the smooth weight of glass fill her hand. It's design and build familiar to her as she had spent endless hours examining its twin- remembering, dancing, dreaming. She could see his face now, conjuring it from her memory, never far from the forefront of her mind. She remembered feeling of his arm wrapped around her waist while she allowed herself to get lost in the memory of his icy blue eyes. His dark amber brows framed them, offering a nice contrast, easing movement of an onlookers gaze across his flawless, fair-skinned face. In the moment, she had raised her left hand to be placed his his- and the glass slipper fell and shattered on the ground at the shoemaker's feet, sending shards of glass rocketing in every direction, a few lodging themselves into her bare calves. \n \n `` Cinderella! What have you done!'' She jumped, her dream clearing from her mind and she looked down at the mess she had created. \n \n `` Mr. Fjor! I'm so sorry! I'll clean it up!'' She could feel the hem of her dress sweeping the now-forming beads of blood across the rest of her calf as she spun around in a flurry for something to collect the broken glass in. \n \n A crowd had begun to gather at the commotion and whispers began to spread of the clumsy girl who had broken the prince's slipper. Moments later guards had arrived and were taking Sir Fjor away as the crowd looked on, Cinderella screaming her protests at them, shouting that she had been the one to break the slipper. \n \n But to no avail. Cinderella went home that night without the glass slippers for her step sisters and with a tortured conscience full of guilt, her voice was hoarse. She could n't sleep that night, tossing and turning. What could she have done? She needed to do something. And by morning she had a plan. \n \n She waited for dawn's light to fill her room, any action sooner and she would have woken the whole house, and walked to her closet. Digging around, deep into the back, she pulled out the blue ball gown. Laying that on her bed, she sat down at her mirrored desk and began trying her best to recreate the princess Fairy Godmother had made her into that night. When she was finished she had GusGus fetch her necklace and fasten it for her. The birds were chirping at her with questions she would answer as she stepped into the dress they were holding, flapping their wings in time with each other. \n \n She swept down the near-vacant cobbled streets of Happily Ever After, encountering only a few early-morning peasants, who would turn and gawk at her as she strode by. When she reached the castle, she raised her gloved hand and firmly knocked. She could hear it's echoes resounding through the corridor on the opposite side. In time, a servant came and met her. Her apparel was enough to render the servant speechless, and she placed her in a room without a spoken word, save only ask, `` Charming?'' And with a nod from Cinderella, the servant was off to fetch the prince. \n \n While she waited, Cinderella cross the room and placed the shoe atop the desk, arranging it in a way that it would be the first thing he would see upon his entrance. \n \n When he entered the confused and irritated expression in face transformed into tears of joy as his eyes slid from the slipper to Cinderella behind it. \n \n He cross the distanced between them and swept her up in his arms.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Jesus was sent from the future to find the girl and save her from stoning\n","story":"They say that for every clever saying, there is an equally clever saying conveying the exact opposite meaning. Empty barrels make the most noise, filled barrels are hardest to bear. I remember as a child, when I first heard someone say: `` Ignorance is bliss''. The apparent tone of intellectual surrender in the phrase annoyed me to no end, so I came up with my own response: `` Bliss is for he, who delivers blessings.'' \n \n Now as I've come of age, I've come to appreciate the simple beauty of the original statement, while my own retort leaves a bitter sweet taste in my mouth. \n \n As you well know, a perk of living in a post-scarcity technocratic society is that everyone is free to pursue the knowledge, he craves, for his own curiosity's sake, without having to worry about jobs, debts or social pressure as in the olden times. Most people are content with living a simple life, as is understandable from a evolutionary viewpoint, but as for myself, I craved something more ever since I was little. My parents sensed my lust for intellectual challenges, and enrolled me in school - a voluntary luxury - where I made my first encounters with the wonders of our world. I was hooked, like the greens are hooked on Flair, and I've pretty much lived my life in various educational and scientific establishments ever since. \n \n I found after a while, that although I was appreciative of everything I learned, the field that had me quivering with excitement was none other than History. I must've read several terabytes of books, articles, correspondences and letters, and have around a zettabyte more stored in my hippocampal chip, for future cross-referencing. I have traveled backwards through time, both literally and figuratively, and observed seemingly minor ( but evidently important ) as well as major events from the 4th all the way through the 8th millenia B.E.C.. Most of these sightings have intrigued me, some have puzzled me, and some have simply amused me. \n \n W.J. Browning's irrefutable proof that the timeline is unalterable, and that all interactions with time travelers are already implemented as factual, historical occurrences, gave a huge peace of mind to those who have ventured through those crevaces of the universe, and it is a strange satisfaction, when you realise, that a thing you read about years ago turns out to have been caused by yourself. Some times you know it before you depart, but some times you do n't realise it until you're right in the middle of it. Many attempts have since been made to disprove Browning's theorem, but all ended up either failing, or simply causing what was already well documented disasters. All evidence points to it being a simple fact of nature, and in time it was accepted, and people instead made a hobby out of `` claiming'' past events ( Yes, the term is a bit misleading, as the timeline is of course still locked in place, and for every event, only one predetermined traveler has always been the one, who would cause it. But in accordance with the Humane Free Will conjecture, I have stuck with the official terminology. ) I myself am for example responsible for the huge spike in celebrity deaths in the year 6032 B.E.C., and the development of the atomic bomb only some seventy years prior. I took a particular liking to this period in time, as you may have guessed. \n \n Since Browning published his result, a whole new field of study has arised, namely the discovery of peculiar past events, that must have been caused by time travelers, but whose origin is yet to be determined, since it allows the discoverer to make attempts at claiming the event. I myself made such a discovery recently, and have repeatedly visited the year 8029 B.E.C., where a man named Jesus heals a woman from her leprosy by a single touch. The technology for this did n't exist at the time, but it does now, so I've made countless attempts at finding the time and place where I could hand it over to this man Jesus, but to my great astonishment, for a long time this went on without any luck. \n \n The discoverer of an event is also the claimer in almost all instances, so this of course seemed odd to me. I could have asked my colleagues for advice, but part of the sport is doing it on your own, and besides - I am probably one of only a few people aware of this event, and I would n't want competition to arise by alerting others to its presence. I have struggled with claiming this event way too long for someone to jump in and snap it away from me at the last second. I decided to go back even further, to when the man was a child, but still to no avail. Out of frustration, I decided to abandon the project for a while, and return at a later time if new ideas showed themselves, and I went back to my previous project - cataloguing the worldwide cultures at the time of the First Nuclear Warfare. \n \n On one of these trips however, I stumbled across a peculiar book, called `` The Bible'', which I later found out ( and imagine my surprise as well as the touch of shame for not having noticed earlier ) had existed in various renditions for over a thousand years. A quick chip scan confirmed this, but the reason it interested me, was because the book spoke of the man Jesus, and his healing of the Leper woman! I was taken aback, and quickly sat down to read the book in its entirety, end to beginning as is often favorable. It was written in the mythic style, referring to Jesus' powers as divine and originating from some higher power. This was it, I thought. The `` higher power'' or `` God'', as he was called in the book, would of course be me, and perhaps the book held some description of the circumstances of him obtaining these powers. \n \n As it turns out, however, the book insists he was born with them, and the God was Jesus' father... \n This seemed odd at first, because one of the consequences of having a static timeline is that you can not reproduce with people of the past, as this would lead to the classic grandfather paradox. I searched for a long time to find the mother of Jesus, and when I did, and asked her how her child was conceived, she told a story not much unlike the one depicted in the book, when the years of interpretation are taken into account. \n \n She told how she had been approached by a specter of sorts, and how when it touched her, she felt a chilling twist of reality followed by a sharp pain in her abdomen. Much later, she realised she was pregnant, and she assumed that the ghost had been responsible for this. When her child grew up, and she saw his capabilities, she had deduced that the ghost must have been their deity, and to be honest, I would have expected even the brightest woman of the time to have come to the same conclusion... \n \n I took a walk in the streets to think things over, when I came across Jesus, who seemed to be agitated over something. As I approached him, I noticed that the flow of people in the street seemed to converge on Jesus' location, and now I noticed the woman, he was shielding with his body. \n \n She was beaten and weak, clenching her legs between her arms and lowering her head to the shouting voices of the onlookers. It appeared the mob wanted her dead, which Jesus would n't let happen. He noticed me in the crowd, and recognized me from my previous visits. He beckoned me to his side, and do n't ask me how, but we managed to talk some sense into the mob, and the mood cooled significantly, especially when I mentioned that they were likely not quite pure and innocent themselves, and they should not be so quick to judge others. The woman thanked us, and Jesus gave his thanks to me as well, saying that this was important to him, although he was n't sure why. Some part of him simply needed that woman to live, despite not knowing who she was. That was tre moment something struck me, and I swiftly ended the conversation with Jesus, to follow the woman. I caught up with her, and although she was shocked by my sudden approach at first, she invited me to her home, when I told her that I, like her, was from the future. And that I was pretty sure we had a deed to do. \n \n \n Here I stand now, years later, with my wife by my side, having just put the final touches on the genetic modifications, that will allow this embryo to grow into a human capable of a great many things, including, but not limited to: excreting antibodies for almost all known diseases, ressurecting under sufficiently mild circumstances of death, developing extremely hydrophobic skin on the soles of his feet... and saving his mother's life, with a little help from his father. \n \n I suppose it's always hard to say goodbye to your child but it is comforting to know he will meet both of us after all, despite being born almost ten thousand years apart. Knowing that you're also sending him to an all too early death is harder to accept as a parent, and it is with tearful gestures that we launch the machine, and mark our place in history as the first people to chronoport an embryo directly into the womb of a fertile woman. I like to entertain the thought, that if I had never learned of Jesus, I would've never had to give him up, and so I would've been spared from this heartache. But this would in turn require that I did n't know about Browning's Law... So in a strange way, ignorance could have been bliss. \n \n Now I only wish for bliss upon he, who shall deliver blessings.\n"}

He wondered about the one's that were n't reported, of the news broadcasters, the rich and government officials who would get away with killing, who would live forever. The world was in chaos. \n \n His heart dropped as he saw the next story. It was about a man who had killed three people in a diner not too far from them. What shocked him was n't the brutality of the killings, nor the fact that the criminal was still at large, but who it was. His sister held his hand as they both stared at an image of their father. \n \n `` Did you know?'' He said to his sister. \n \n `` I'd heard from someo-'' \n \n `` You need to go.'' \n \n `` Miles, please. You do n't have to be alone.'' \n \n `` Can you please just go!'' They sat in silence a moment, then she nodded. \n \n `` I'll be in the waiting room, just call if you want me back.'' With that she left. \n \n Miles turned off the television, and rested his back in the pillows. He wanted so badly to turn over and sleep on his side, but the cuffs prevented that. So, he lay there staring at the ceiling, until he eventually fell into slumber. \n \n * * * \n \n When he awoke the room was dark, he must have been asleep a few hours. \n \n `` They're making a new law, huh Miles.'' He heard the voice of a man across the room, he knew that voice. \n \n `` It's supposed to make things better.'' A man rose out from the shadows, it was his father. \n \n `` NURSE!'' He screamed. `` NURSE!'' \n \n `` Shh Miles. Please. Do n't be afraid of me.'' \n \n `` Afraid of you? You're a monster!'' \n \n `` Miles, I've come to help. I've come to tell you the truth.'' \n \n `` What are you talking about?'' He whimpered, he could feel the heat of tears behind his eyes. `` You're a killer. Stay away from me.'' \n \n `` Everyone's a killer in this world.'' His father replied, pulling something out of his coat pocket. It was a key. \n \n `` Where did you get that?'' He asked as his father began removing his cuffs. \n \n ``'What do you think I am Miles. I've always wondered.'' \n \n `` You're a monster, You- You killed my mother.'' He stuttered his words as tears rolled down his cheeks. \n \n `` I had to.'' \n \n `` That's bullshit. You just wanted those extra years, that's why you killed those men in that diner.'' \n \n `` Will you hear me out?'' His father said, pushing Miles down when he tried getting out of the bed. \n \n `` Your mother was sick. That night when she came into your room, she was going to kill you Miles. She going to take the rest of your life away.'' \n \n `` You're a liar.'' \n \n `` We can just have another child, she said to me. We can have another boy, she said, you'll never get another love, not like me.'' his father had his own set of tears now. \n \n `` That's not true. She loved me and Maggie.'' \n \n `` Fear changes people.'' The man was pulling something else out of his coat pocket now. The steel flashed in the dim lighting, it was a gun. \n \n `` What is that for? Are you going to kill me now? Are you going to tell Maggie I tried to kill you too?'' \n \n `` It's for you, Miles. Take t. Take it and shoot me.'' He handed the boy the gun. \n \n `` What the hell, I'm not going t-'' \n \n `` They're making a new law Miles. Did you hear? They're going to start tagging people at birth, and once you've reached a certain age, I think 120 is what they said, the law is you have to give your remaining span to a youth in need.'' \n \n `` I'm not going to kill you.'' \n \n `` It's not a perfect law. But changes are starting Miles. The world's getting better I promise.'' \n \n `` Stop talking.'' \n \n `` Those men I killed in that diner, they were thugs. They were bad men, Miles. I needed to make sure I had enough years. I needed to make sure I had enough years for this to be worth it.'' His father was balling now. \n \n `` Please, stop.'' Miles said through tear filled sobs. \n \n `` I'm your father Miles. This is my job. Please let me do my job. I love you, son. Please, pull the trigger.'' The man held Miles' hands in his own, and raised the gun to his temple. `` Tell them I tried to kill you, tell them it was self defense whatever works. Just live your life Miles. Help change this world. Help make it better.'' \n \n Miles stared at his father's dirt filled face, his blood smeared hands. What had this man been through? \n \n `` I-I love you too, dad.'' He whimpered, and then he pulled the trigger. \n \n \n \n\n"}

The idea is n't entirely fleshed out yet, but it's something I really want to write, so here's a part of it. \n _______ \n **CRUNCH TIME** \n \n `` No! No! No! No no no no no no!'' Jayke felt his heart drop as the map on the right hand side of his contact display filled with red dots. \n \n `` Sir! They're everywhere! What's going on? We were told-'' \n \n `` I know what you were told, captain, I was the one who told you,'' he snapped, quickly pulling up the map on his display. His contacts were freaking out with the amount of dots and movement they were displaying. \n \n `` What do we do? We'll be dead in less than five minutes if you do n't do anything.'' \n \n Jaykes was furiously swiping around and zooming in and out on the map, looking for any way into the fight without compromising himself. There were no vents, no back doors, nothing. He either had to go in guns blazing, showing everyone that he was there, or let them die. \n \n Things just got worse when Ty's voice came over the coms. \n \n `` Jayke! We've got a problem.'' \n \n He groaned inwardly as he minimized the map for a second to focus on Ty. \n \n `` What happened? What's going on?'' \n \n `` They know we're here.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` They... We... Look, I do n't know how, but,'' Ty's voice faded slightly as he fought off a couple of enemies, `` they somehow found out that we're here. In some way they managed to figure out that we were going to be here. We walked into an ambush. They blew the entrance to the data center too. The only way we're getting in is through sector 3, and it's currently occupied.'' \n \n Jayke swore and punched the wall next to him, his fist leaving an imprint on the dull and dark surface. His mind was racing, but he had no answers thus far. Suddenly, he looked up, his hand still on the wall. \n \n `` Ty, do they know where I am?'' \n \n He was silent for a few moments, but to Jayke, it felt like an eternity. \n \n `` I do n't think so. They probably think you're around somewhere though. It's only logical, really.'' \n \n `` How long will it take you guys?'' \n \n `` Does n't matter. I saw the map. We have to act now, and we ca n't do that. We're pinned.'' \n \n Jayke growled. He was frustrated. Everything was going wrong. He was expecting small delays or problems with the actual execution, but this was ridiculous. \n \n He closed his eyes, sweat beading on his forehead. He began to methodically think his way through. \n \n `` Sir! We need help now! We're getting massacred!'' \n \n `` Shut up...'' Jayke muttered, his hands on his temples. \n \n `` Jayke, we've got about 10 minutes before we clear this out. The squads on sector 3 are going to last around 2 minutes tops. You got ta move soon.'' \n \n `` Just shut up! LET ME THINK!'' Jayke switched off the coms and squeezed his eyes shut even harder, focusing on the task at hand. \n \n Jayke's hands were trembling slightly. There was a lot at stake here. If he chose wrong, this whole operation could be lost. He knew there had to be *some* way that they could save this, but the only options he had were off the table just because of how delicate the plan was. \n \n *Well, first off, there's a leak. There's no way they could have known we were coming unless there was one. And second, the only way we're going to win this is if I come out of hiding and show myself at this point. * \n \n He shook his head. He had very little time left. \n \n *Fighting all those troops would be something doable, and I could probably stall until Ty and the others arrived to clean them up, but we'd lose a ton of time. We've got 15 minutes, and I wo n't be able to get to the data center in time if I do n't stay hidden. * \n \n His contacts showed the flood of red dots still, and Ty had n't spoken since his last communication, which meant he was deep in combat. \n \n Jayke gritted his teeth. This was so frustrating. Mentally, he kicked himself for not thinking about the enemy predicting their movements, or knowing about them. \n \n There was no time left. He looked at the timer on his contacts again. The numbers were steadily counting down. It was down to 14:30 now. He had to move, or they'd lose the only opening they had into the data sector. \n \n He had two options: try to just straight up sprint to the data center and hope he could finish planting the tracers in time, or fighting to stall and protect the one opening they had into the data center from the outside. Either way, he was going to be pressed for time. Either way, things were going to go wrong. If only he had more time. Just a little more time... \n \n `` SCREW THIS!'' Jayke charged his hands with Lightning, and then smashed them into the wall with his imprint. The wall exploded, and Jayke leaped out of the hole into the room below. As he was falling, he fired a huge blast at the wall adjacent to him. The explosion rocked the room, and smoke and dust filled the air. The room behind the recently destroyed wall contained the flood of red dots. Everything stopped as Jayke landed. Everyone, friends and enemies alike, looked to the newly remodeled wall to see what had just caused such a spectacular scene. \n \n Through the dust and smoke, a single figure stood, hands glowing a bright blue from the Lighting being channeled inside. The figure drew his sword, channeling Lightning into the blade, causing it to dully glow blue. No one knew if they should shoot or not, because they could n't tell if it was a friend or an enemy to themselves. \n \n Normally, Jayke relished these moments. He was in control. He knew what was happening, and what was going to happen. He knew that everything depended on what he did. The entire mission hinged on this single moment. These moments were his rush. They were his high. He usually *thrived* in situations like this. \n \n But he was n't happy about it this time. This time, he was being *forced* to show his hand. He liked having the advantage, not scrambling to catch one. \n \n His eyes narrowed and he bared his teeth as he slowly walked to the edge of the smoke which cloaked him. He was n't even sure he could stall enough to protect the already badly damaged squad huddled behind random areas of cover. All he knew, is that this was the only option where he could think more than just two steps ahead. Regardless of whether or not he could stall and save them, he had to fight. They forced him to do it. And he hated them for it. \n \n 13:45. That was the time limit. That was all he had. \n \n He was going to tear them apart. \n \n ____ \n \n Let me know what you think. Critique is welcome, but be nice. XD \n \n Thanks for reading! \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ EU ] WWIII breaks out . A young Clark Kent is drafted .\n","story":"Dad always had me lie low. It's instinct now. At Basic I tied a pair of tube socks around my knee and made a show of favoring it every time we ran. \n \n `` You're back of the pack, Pvt. Kent!'' my CO called out. I let a smile slip, tried to cover it by faking a grimace, and as his eyes widened I made a show of tripping as my knee buckled. \n \n `` Dammit, Kent. Get going!'' \n \n As I ran by the I heard the CO mumble, `` damn kid, must be some old football injury. Or he's skinnyfat. Looks like he could outrun them all.'' \n \n No promotions. No recognition. \n \n First deployment was Colombia. Our force was tasked with retaking the construction grounds for the ISS elevator. It was an international money pit, but with more solar and nuclear generation than the rest of the continent. Regaining control would destabilize the Rushina sympathizers. \n \n I grabbed my issued xM-1, keyed in my fingerprint and activated the headcam. I had the sat radio pack for the squad. Back of the pack had stuck as my nickname, `` Backpack Kent''. I slung the 40 pounds of gear and marched behind my dozen squadmates, as a glorified wifi hotspot. \n \n We took the transport from Bogota to Baranquilla. As we dropped on the beachhead the drone mines rose up from just beyond the breaking waves. They detached from solar lilypads and buzzed toward our squad. \n \n We dropped to the sand and began firing on the incoming mines. I took aim with my rifle, but it was simply easier to laser them with my eyes. Practicing a few years ago on the porch in Kansas, I could pulse a laser before anyone could see any visible beam. \n \n And these drones were small. I popped two. Resendez hit one with a long burst from his rifle, and the others shot wildly into the surf. The hand grenade size targets were powerful enough to rip up half the dozen squad members and we had more than 50 targets still incoming. \n \n I could n't fly out or zap them all without a continuous beam. No promotions. No recognition. But we were about to blow to bits. \n \n I took a deep breath and dropped my headcam face down into the sand. I blew pulsing breaths into sand around us, creating a miniature tornado and blinding my squadmates. I hovered up above the sandcloud, blowing 100 mph winds down on them each time a head popped up. \n \n I eyed the incoming targets, thought through their trajectory, and arced my laser vision across them. Only one left remaining. As it hummed toward me, I shed my dogtags and uniform. Unslinging the backpack, I held it up as a shield before the incoming drone mine. It exploded over my squad's heads, raining down the scraps. \n \n Backpack Kent died on that beach. It was time for Superman to go to war. \n \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a cleaner in a lab when you witnessed the first victims of a horrific airborne supervirus . To bad no one belives a cleaner .\n","story":"*Shoot me* I thought as I opened the door to the lab. This was the third day in a row that they \u2019 d called for an extra cleanup after I \u2019 d already been through the lab once. If they couldn \u2019 t keep their interns from trashing the place during the open research hours, then why the hell was it my job to clean it over and over? I technically didn \u2019 t get overtime, but my super was generally willing to let me go home early\u2026if the damn lab didn \u2019 t need yet another extra cleaning. Beakers were spilled, microscopes were left out, solutions were left running on mixers, and even some of the biohazard containers were left open. Everything went into a bio-disposal bin and into the incinerator. At least I got to have some sort of revenge; if those disorganized PhD students left their work out to mold and didn \u2019 t mark it or store it properly, I got to dump it and burn it. Start over from scratch you brilliant, lazy, unorganized slobs. \n \n *Shoot me* I thought once again as I wheeled the bio-bin around one of the heavy tables and noticed one of my coworkers on the far end of the lab. Eric should \u2019 ve gone home hours ago, but apparently he was staying late doing the same thing I was. He motioned irregularly at me and turned to face a wall. Something about him seemed odd. Then I remembered that Eric had said he was feeling unwell that morning and had called off for the afternoon. He turned towards me and took one fairly unsteady step before lunging ahead in a full speed sprint. Now that he was in a better light I could see his face was covered in red. It was contorted into a painful expression. \n \n I staggered backwards and tripped on my mop bucket. As I regained some sense of composure I realized that Eric was only a few feet from me. I quickly swung the bio-bin around and planted him squarely on his back with a blow that knocked the lid off of the secure container, revealing all manner of sharps, solutes, and other undesirable materials. Eric Suddenly seemed to regain his composure and grabbed a broken portion of beaker. He stabbed it into his neck over and over again. As he did this, his eyes seemed to glaze over and eventually he dropped his shard and turned towards me once again. \n \n I grabbed one of the tables and flipped it directly onto him. The table weighed every bit of two hundred pounds and was sufficient to slow him down enough for me to make a run for it, but then I heard him gurgle something. \n \n \u201c Shoot me \u201d He managed to sputter out. \n \n It sounded pained, and almost inhuman. With the table on top of him I could see more of his symptoms, blood oozing from his eyes, nose, and ears, pink irritated skin, cloudy white eyes, and unchecked aggression marked by intermittent periods of lucidity. The monkeys used for study exhibited the exact symptoms after being exposed to a highly contagious virus, if the PhD students were to be believed. It hit me that the monkey lab was completely airtight; you wore a biohazard suit in, showered off after, and only a few employees, Eric included, were experienced enough to safely clean it. \n \n \u201c SHOOT ME! \u201d Eric snarled and brought me back to my senses. I quickly ran to the cupboard where I knew a loaded gun would be stored. Too many thieves had broken into the lab in the last few years and Brazil wasn \u2019 t the safest place to begin with\u2026even if it was incredibly easy to get monkeys on short notice. The only gun was a.44 magnum. \n \n I walked over to Eric, ensured a round was ready to fire, and aimed it at his head. He nodded somberly. At the last second I thought about spatter, and flipped a table for cover. I fired one round around the corner of the table. The explosion was horrific. Blood flew to the ceiling, covered the table, and basically everything within a few feet of what was left of Eric. His head was a destroyed mess. I discarded the gun and quickly got into the chemical shower. They always told us how to use it in case the worst happened, but, to date it \u2019 d never been needed. \n \n I quickly dressed and called my super who apparently had a hard time understanding my incoherent babble, but informed me that the police were on their way. As I waited I checked the computer for the other two cleaners who \u2019 d been on Eric \u2019 s shift. Both had left shortly after Eric called off. They were on vacation. The note in the computer indicated that they \u2019 d be flying home to visit relatives in the US. By now, they were probably already in the air. As this horrific thought washed over me I was tackled to the ground by a large man screaming Portuguese at me as he cuffed my hands. I was hit hard on the head with a baton and blacked out. \n \n When I came to, I was strapped to a chair with three other police officers asking me rapid fire questions in a language I didn \u2019 t understand. Once they got an interpreter, I was able to glean that our lab was slightly illegal at best and a blatant animal rights violation more likely. The cops thought I killed Eric and robbed him. No one believed my story of his contorted face, or oozing blood. There wasn \u2019 t much left of his head to tell the truth. I checked the time and realized that both of Eric \u2019 s coworkers had long since landed in the US. \n \n Once the cops decided I wasn \u2019 t going to give them any more information, they left and took the interpreter with them. I began to cry. I was devastated. I \u2019 d be kept here until they decided it was time for a trial, no lawyer, nothing. As I cried I began to feel dizzy. I noticed that my tears were leaving dark stains on my white coveralls. My nose began to run and I felt an incredible anger begin to well up within me as I slipped from consciousness. \n \n *Shoot me*\n"}

This had better not be some stupid telemarketting call. \n \n *HOLY SHIT BARRY YOU GOT TO GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE NOW! * \n \n Barry jerked the phone away from his ear, the violent screaming voice probably tore his eardrum. \n \n > Jesus Christ Wanda you almost blew my ear off. \n \n *Oh my god, I'm sorry Barry but you really have to come to work now, please I do n't know what to do! * \n \n > OK OK.... come down Wanda. You know I'm not due to work until noon today. \n \n *Barry please! I need you here. Andrew wo n't return my call and Ahsley is crying in the freezer. You're the only day-time manager available, please come to work! * \n \n Barry sighted. \n \n > Fine... but I'm billing Andrew double overtime for this. I'll be there in 15. \n \n *Oh thank you thank you thank you! * \n \n Barry hung up and got dressed. This was weird, He had n't seen Wanda this panicked since the McLobster Incident in 2012 and Ahsley was usually a pretty level headed person. What was going on down there that would have them both in such a panic? He grabbed a leftover pizza slice from the fridge and jumped in his 2004 Honda Civic. \n \n Traffic seemed unusually heavy this morning. Going to work usually only took 10 minutes even on rush hours but for some reason traffic was ridiculous. When Barry finally made it to Main Street he understood why. A line of car almost half a mile long stretched all the way from the restaurant's drive-thru lane. The parking lot was spilling out unto the adjacent restaurants. Horn were honking and people were yelling. Above the chaos Barry could here one word over and over: *Szechuan* \n \n Barry entered the restaurant trough the back service door. No point in even trying to reach the front door with all these angry yelling people. He popped in head in the freezer and sure enough, Ashley was curled up in the corner, crying. Tammy was trying to console here but she looked scared helpless. Just what the hell was going on today? \n \n As soon as Wanda caught sight of Barry, she threw herself on him and hugged him with all of her strenght, tears of joy were running down her face. \n \n *This is horrible Barry, I've never seen anything like this, they came out of nowhere, They're crazy! * \n \n > OK calm down, just tell what the fuck is happening here today \n \n *It started off as any other morning. I got here 30 minutes before opening. There were a few cars already waiting in the parking. A little more than usual but it's hardly worth mentioning I mean we always have early birds. * \n \n > OK, go on. \n \n *The first few customer were the usual morning coffee and muffin type but then some guy ordered McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. * \n \n > Wait, Szechuan sauce? What the hell is that? \n \n *I do n't know! I simply told him that we do n't serve lunch meal until 10am but he would n't hear it, he kept demanding McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. * \n \n > Fucking weirdo \n \n *But then, the person behind him heard us talking and got mad when he understood that we would n't give him his McNuggets with Szechuan sauce. Before long I had over 10 people screaming for Szechuan sauce. I DO N'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS!!! * \n \n Indeed people were still screaming in the restaurant. Barry could't make out everything being said in all the commotion but *Szechuan sauce* and some guy named *Rick* kept being repeated. \n \n > Wanda, who's Rick? \n \n *RICK! YES! That's what they're saying. Apparently they saw some no-name obscur cartoon named Rick and Porty or whatever and he mentioned Szechuan sauce at some point. * \n \n > Well where the hell did he got that sauce from? I've been working here almost 10 years and I never heard about it until today. \n \n *I'm not sure, something to do with 1998 and Mulan. Bary please I am freaking out here. We do n't get paid enough to deal with this crazy internet meme shit* \n \n > Jesus Christ.... 1998. That was 20 years ago. I mean I was barely 5 back then. \n \n Barry was trying his best to put the pieces together and think of a solution before the hord of crazy maniacs out there jumped the counter. \n \n > I GOT IT! \n \n Wanda looked up, wiping the tears from her eyes. \n \n *What did you find? * \n \n > 1998! I do n't remember shit from these days, nobody does! These maniacs out there, they're like us! They're young, they watch stupid internet cartoon and most of them still had a freaking diaper to their asses back in 1998. No way they actually know what Szechuan sauce is, let alone what it tastes like! \n \n *Well, from what some of them yelled out, the show made it look dark brown on the alien guy's hands* \n \n > Alien guy? \n \n *Yeah, I do n't understand it either. This show must be really weird or really bad. Either way the only thing we know about Szechuan sauce is that it should be dark brown, we got nothing on taste or texture. * \n \n > Do n't need to, these idiots will never know. \n \n Barry looked around the stocking shelves nervously until he found what he was looking for. \n \n > BIGMAC SAUCE! Wanda! Get me 2 tubs of BigMac sauce and some brown-beef food coloring and tell Ashley and Tammy to get their asses out of the freezer and fire up the deep fryers, they got a shitload of McNuggets to prepare! \n \n As Barry looked at the staff tear off the lids of BigMac sauce tubs and chruning out McNuggets faster than ever before he could n't help but to think that Wanda was right about at least one thing. His 0.50 $ \/hour daytime manager bonus meant he really was n't paid enough to deal with this shit. \n\n"}

His voice seemed to come from nowhere and had an unnerving echo. I shivered, looking once again at my corpse. It was strange to see myself looking so peaceful. My corpse sat against the wall, rope around it's neck, and its mouth curled up in a grisly smile. \n \n I turned towards death. `` What was the point?'' He did not respond. `` Was I ever meant to have a chance? Or was it all just a cosmic joke?'' Death just stood there, waiting. `` Everyone else had a chance!'' I started yelling. `` They all had smiled, and laughed, and cried. They had things they loved - passions - and all I got was an empty gnawing.'' I began crying. `` Why only now?'' I saw choking back tears just to talk. `` Why can I only feel it now? I thought that was the end, that I could just go away and it would all be gone. So why, why do I feel so sad?'' \n \n I stopped talking while I wept. I tried to choke out a few words but could n't manage it. Death just stood there motionlessly. `` It's not fair!'' I cried out. `` Why did n't I just die? I do n't want to feel this.'' I wept. `` I never got to feel anything while I was alive, so why now? I was screaming at death. `` Why?'' I fell to the floor, defeated. \n \n I heard a knock at the door. `` Kate, are you in there?'' It was my Dad. He was supposed to be gone all day, that's why I chose today to die. I did n't want him to find me yet. Especially not now, while I was like this. \n \n I jumped up to death, wiping the tears from my eyes. `` Please, do n't let him find me like this! Please, I do n't want to see that! I'll do anything..'' I heard another knock and slumped where I stood. `` Please, let me try again. I did n't even have a chance. How can anyone live like that, so empty? Please, just let me have a real chance.'' \n \n Death moved for the first time. His echoing voice rang out again. `` There will a cost.'' \n \n `` Anything!'' \n \n Death moved towards me, his movements uncanny and awkward. `` Are you sure, child?'' \n \n `` Yes please, I do n't want him to see me like this, and I want a real chance!'' \n \n Death extended his hand, smiling, `` Deal?'' Everything about him was uncanny. His movements were erratic and awkward, and his smile was twisted and incomplete. Still, I had no other option. \n \n I extended my hand and grasped his firmly, `` Deal.'' \n \n _____ \n \n I woke gasping for air and clawing at the rope around my neck. `` I'm alive!'' I quickly undid the knot and breathed a sigh of relief when I finished. I never remembered feeling so exhilarated or relieved. `` I'm right here Dad!'' I yelled out. I quickly got up and looked at the door. \n \n Silence. \n \n `` Dad?'' \n \n With some trepidation I moved to my door. Taking a moment to ready myself, I opened the door. Then I screamed. He was laying on the ground, covered in blood. I fell to the ground with tears streaming down my face screaming in pain. In the distance I heard the faint sound of cruel laughter echoing.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're an American sniper in Berlin during the Cold War . Your task is to eliminate Soviet officials ; they continue to evade and you continue to follow , until then one perfect shot .\n","story":"'Paper's citizen.' The little agent standing below me said. I did not take my eye from the scope but I heard the shuffling as the man reached into his coat and handed across identity. More shuffling as the agent inspected them. \n \n'All in order.' Krugachek tapped his foot impatiently and then walked away. The citizen he had questioned followed, his foot steps slower, obviously hoping to put some distance between him and the KGB agent. So Krugachek had caught my trail again. For me the cold war was becoming hot. Too hot. Twice before he had almost caught me. Mina had saved me the last time, yelling a warning while Krugachek and his goons had waited in our apartment. I'd heard her scream of pain and then nothing more. It did not matter. I had one more kill to make. One more shot and, whatever happened then, my work was done. If Holtz had showed his face while Krugachek had been standing below me I would have fired regardless. \n \n Holtz was the last name on my list. Assassins were the front line troops of the cold war. My left leg started to go to sleep and I wriggled it as much as I could without disturbing my rifle. At five hundred yards, especially with this old peasant's rifle, I could n't afford even a hair's movement. I had walked the distance from the brothel to this flat and with each step thought of Holtz, thought of finishing a mission that had began twenty years ago in the Dardanelles. Back then I was only a private who was considered the best shot in the regiment. Holtz had been my seargent. Betrayal in war time I could have understood. Defection in peacetime, after all we had been through together, I could not. \n \n The clock struck and I sighed. I had given the man time to appear but now curfew was in effect. Holtz would stay the night in the brothel. I hope it cost him dearly. I lowered my rifle and rolled my shoulders to ease tension. I pillowed my head on my arm, wrapped my coat tighter, and slept. \n \n'What is this?' I asked, holding the small vial in my palm. \n \n'Poison.' \n \n'I know.' I replied sourly,'What's it doing in my supplies.' \n \n'Poison has been used by assassins-' I waved Smythe silent and shook my head,'When I came to you and offered my services I told you I want to do it my way.' \n \n The effeminate British man tweaked an end of his moustache uneasily,'I was hesitant about this when you volunteered and I am starting to reconsider sending you. The war is over.' \n \n I laughed coldly,'If the war is over then what is it were doing here?' \n \n'You know exactly what I mean. With the surrender of Japan-' \n \n'-Russia became the new enemy.' I felt suddenly tired. I stood up,'No poisons, no bombs, nothing. It'll be easier for me to get in that way anyway. If I am stopped what will they find on me but papers, clothes and the like.' \n \n'Using a rifle is madness. You're not a sniper now.' \n \n'I was n't then.' I growled and stormed out of his office. \n \n I awoke with the memory still fresh in my mind. The chill of the German air seeped through me. Deep in my lungs I felt the rattle of pneumonia. I looked up at the half moon. It was about midnight. I went back to sleep. \n \n'Take the shot.' Holtz ordered. I looked up at him and shook my head. \n \n'Shoot her god damn it.' He snapped. \n \n'I've killed a woman and I ai n't about to start.' I growled at him. He stared down at me, his attire impeccable. The man never lost the sheen of his Yale professorship no matter how bad the situation became. He seemed on edge now. \n \n'There are bigger things at stake, Vince.' Holtz cried,'If she gets back to the Germans they'll know the 1st is moving toward their right flank. Those men will be exposed. Shoot the bitch. She's a traitor anyway. A goddamned French girl who had sold herself to the enemy.' \n \n I swallowed. I had liked the vivacious village girl who had shown up in the camp. That she was a spy no one would have guessed. She had her reasons for supporting the Nazis, I suppose. \n \n'Shoot her and that's an order.' Holtz yelled. I ignored him. \n \n'Shoot her or I'll shoot you.' He said this softly, drawing his side arm methodically and pointing it at my head. \n \n I swallowed, staring into his eyes. He would do it. My life or hers. I lifted the scope to my eye and centred my sights on the fleeing girl. I fired. The back of her head exploded, blood ripping into her streaming hair. \n \n'I am sorry Vince. What she supported, what she stood for.' He sighed,'What we're fighting for is something more than the freedom of Europe. Its the freedom of mankind, of the human soul. You know I'm right.' \n \n I woke again. Dawn was upon me. I shook my head to clear the memory but the woman's exploding head I saw again and again. If freedom of the soul was so important, Holtz, why did you sell it out? Why did you turn your back on the freedom you valued, that you made me kill my own soul over? \n \n I stretched out lazily and then picked up my rifle again. I settled into position, my scope fixed on the door. The door opened. It was so unexpected I almost fired prematurely. Holtz stood in the doorway, I started to squeeze the trigger but a whore was standing behind him. If I fired I risked killing her too. One perfect shot and I could not take it. I willed her to move but she seemed content to stand there and Holtz content to stand in the doorway. My lungs were burning. I had held my breath to steady the rifle and had forgotten to exhale. \n \n'Good morning, comrade.' Krugachek was right behind me. Holtz was still in my sights, and the whore too. \n \n'Lower the rifle. You've led me a merry chase, as the English say, but I have caught you now.' \n \n I would never have another chance. I needed to stall. I exhaled and then took a grateful breath. I heard Krugachek move beside me. \n \n'What became of Mina?' \n \n'She loved you very much.' He said conversationally,'She endured much for you.' \n \n The whore moved back inside. I had my shot. \n \n'She died for you.' He continued,'Her heart was weaker than we expected.' \n \n Holtz started to walk down the steps. I could still blow off the top of his head. I lowered the rifle. \n \n I looked up at Krugachek standing over me, his Luger pointed at me. \n \n'Let us make a deal.' I muttered,'I have much you want to know.' I pushed the rifle far away and sat back. \n \n'What would you offer that I will not get anyway?' \n \n'Nothing.' I replied and dove for him. He fired. We crashed together and tumbled over the roof. It was then I felt the pain in my chest from where he had shot me. I pictured the French girl again, through my scope, and this time she turned to me and I saw Mina's face.\n"}

I fumbled with my keys as I took them out of the lock and dropped them, I shrugged and found my way into my room after closing the door behind me. \n \n `` Fucking everything'' I mumbled `` Fucking life'' \n \n I looked around my room frantically, I had to find it fast before I passed out. I began looking through my closet and as I did I remembered the day my father died. My mum died in a car crash when I was four so my dad was all I ever had. But of course he was taken away from me when I was twenty. I slammed the closet door shut and shambled over to my desk, moving papers and such around searching for it. As I did I thought about school. I was always a loner, always bullied and picked on. They all hated me. \n \n `` I hated you pricks too for your information...'' I muttered to myself as I spotted it in the corner of my room. I made my way over, grabbing the chair from my desk on the way before picking it up. \n \n `` Here you were you little bastard.'' I smiled as I picked it up and clambered onto the chair, being careful not to fall off. I began attempting to tie it around the rafter above me. As I did I thought of my first girlfriend and the time we first kissed. Just past high school it was, standing in the rain we kissed and she looked at me and smiled so lovingly, she did that cute laugh of hers that she always did when I did something she liked. I hesitated for a moment. She told me eventually I'd never matted, I was always just a tool for her to get over her ex. I guess she never really loved me. \n \n `` I always loved her though.'' I murmured. \n \n I finished tying the knots. I put my head through the noose. Not like I had anyone who'd care after all. No one who really loved me. Just before I kicked the chair out from underneath me I looked to the mirror beside me. Tears streaming down my face I croaked my final words. \n \n `` For what it's worth...

Good old CERN had done the leg work, but I did provide the theories to efficiently create antimatter, of which they immediately created so much that it annihilated existence itself, except for Death, God, and me. \n \n Well, as I stood in the middle of nothing, Death appeared behind me, sweat pouring down his cheeks. He was livid, I was on the verge of laughter. \n \n `` You asshole! I just had to reap 16 quintillion souls in an instant because of you. \n \n I responded by mentioning that I did n't know that there were that many sentient beings in the universe. \n \n Of course, by now he was right at the edge of lashing out, I'd just given him the biggest workload ever issued to anyone, even God, and it happened randomly. \n \n He bore his scythe, such a cliched instrument, and slashed me across the chest, cutting me in half. My body instantly rejoined, I had n't bored of life, so the bet was still active, and I was still immortal. It did help that I had convinced him to make me an absolute immortal rather than merely incapable of dying. \n \n `` Fine, fine,'' I said lamenting my poor suit which now had a slash mark and blood stain across it. `` I'll make you a counter deal to our original wager. I'll take on the role of death, and you can partake of shenanigans for this next universe.

As you rightly point out, no one else has ever seen one of these'blue boxes' that he claims appear before the attacks. It seems quite clear that they simply do not exist outside of Hitler's imagination.'' \n \n The officer looked down at his notes. \n \n `` This is the fourth time Adolf has ended up in hospital with a gunshot wound, can delusions explain every incident?'' \n \n Dr Frankl sat back, sighed, and said: \n \n `` It is an unusual case to be sure. I can only believe the illusions are brought on by the intense emotional stress Hitler is under. Twice now he has been rejected by the Vienna Academy, and it seems unlikely he will ever be successful as an artist. His paintings are rather... crude.'' \n \n The doctor placed his glasses on his nose and continued: \n \n `` Unfortunately Adolf dreams of being a great artist. Given his almost certain failure in achieving that dream, it is not unlikely his psyche will attempt to create a reason for his failure outside of his own ability. A self inflicted gunshot to the arms for example. Of course, Hitler may not realise these are delusions, his mind may simply be protecting his ego from the truth.'' \n \n The police officer cleared his throat. \n \n `` Is there anything we can do to help him? We've tried keeping him away from weapons, but somehow he keeps getting hold of the guns.'' \n \n The psychiatrist leaned forward. \n \n `` Adolf seems to have developed an interesting hypothesis. You see, he believes that his art is so great, and so threatening to the world, that a conspiracy has been formed to eliminate him and prevent him from creating more art.

You 're an American who just crashed landed a boat in North Korea .\n","story":"`` He's a lucky man. Much longer underwater and even we could n't have saved him.'' \n \n The voice was swimming in my ears, seeming slightly muffled. The accent was unfamiliar, but yet I thought it must be from some part of Asia. I did n't know who was talking. All I could yet see was darkness as of yet. Then, I realized that my eyes were closed. Shifting with a groan, my lashes fluttered, and a white room slowly cleared in my vision from a blur. A man and a woman in long white coats were standing at my bedside, stethoscopes around their necks. A monitor beeped beside me. Why had n't I heard that first? \n \n `` Ah, it seems luck has woken up.'' The woman remarked. I looked at the pair, blinking. `` Where am I?'' I could n't tell if they were Chinese or Japanese, but they were definitely Asian. Maybe even Laotian. `` Who are you?'' Questions were swimming through my head, which was throbbing with a dull ache. I decided their nationality could wait. \n \n `` You're in a hospital. You were in an accident. I'm afraid your boat is gone, but you were lucky to have been found when you were. A team of divers pulled you out. You must have been in the cabin when it capsized.'' The man explained. `` I am Doctor Sung, and my colleague here is Doctor Ohnn.'' He indicated the woman, who gave me a smile. `` I admit, we were surprised to have an American brought in. Very few from your country visit us here.'' \n \n `` Here? Where is here?'' I demanded, their names already forgotten in my aching mind. \n \n `` Why... Pyongnang. This is North Korea.'' Doctor Ohnn explained, her voice gentle and kind. `` You're in the capital city, Mr. Mason.'' \n \n It took me a minute to realize how they knew who I was, but of course I had ID on me when I'd been out. Still, the shock was evident in my voice. `` North Korea? Why am I not dead?'' I asked this even as I realized all the care which had been taken with me. The bed was very comfortable, the pillows soft. There were even a few personal effects, salvaged and laid out neatly on the opposite side of the doctors. `` I thought this was a poor country... I thought you hated Americans. I've read about this country... all the prison camps and corruption. Your government kills all sorts of innocents!'' I frowned, confused. Even as I looked out the window, I could see how this might not be true. It looked like the cleanest city I'd ever seen, the buildings well-kept and the people seemed content as they walked. The cars that drove by -- wait, were they hovering? I could n't begin to process that, so I looked back at the Doctors. I wanted to hear their excuse this time. \n \n Doctor Sung smiled sadly. `` I expected you'd say that. The history you've read is true, but I guess it's easier to put North Korea's name instead of admit your own tyranny.'' As my mouth hung open, he put a hand on my shoulder. `` We can speak more later. You should get some more rest.''

You 've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping . Death is baffled .\n","story":"If Death had a face I think it would be unnerved. I ca n't really remember how old I am. In fact the day I first met him is a blur. He cradled me like a long lost son. It was comforting in all the best ways. It was n't cold. It was the warmest I've ever felt. I should have had it all in that moment. But something inside me felt a stirring restlessness. It was n't mine time. \n \n This was n't the first time someone rejected Death. It was almost expected for him. Still, most people plead for a longer life. A few asked for immortality too. But I was the only one who explained I'd never tire of living. In a curious state of mind, Death granted my request. I would live as long as I remained content with living. \n \n After the end of the second death of the Universe and the explosion into the third Death approached me again. Faceless as always, he moved with an odd sort of clairvoyance. He was near omnipotent, and yet I was here. A riddle that utterly perplexed him. He did n't need a face to show is bafflement. \n \n `` Indulge me,'' he said. Once his voice was cold and calm. Now I noticed it's hidden warmth. Death was very busy after all. I enjoyed our chats whenever they could be had. I nodded as he approached with a glistening smile. `` You are still here. How?'' I played furrowed my brow confused. A grin crept for the corner of my mouth as I tried to play coy. It's not easy hiding oneself from Death. \n `` What comes after death?'' I said with my pleasant smile. I sensed impatience within Death. It was n't the first time I asked that question. Nor was it new. Countless souls had asked the same questions. I even got to witness a few trillion. \n \n Death continued to wait. Unwilling to play my game. `` Still wo n't tell me, huh?'' I said breaking he silence in between us. Out in the vast emptiness signs of cosmic creation bloomed. The first new atoms began forming. In a few billion years there would be stars again. `` That is the answer you know,'' I said turning back to Death, `` I do n't know what comes after I die. You wo n't tell me.'' My smile returned to my face as I saw a spark of light. `` This is all I have for all I know. Sure some of it is the same as before. I may even run out of things to see. But not today.'' Death turned to leave but I raised my hand to stop him. `` You will always be around right? Always were? Always reaping. Seems to me their ought to be balance to all that. I do n't create life, that is beyond my talents but I remember it. I'll hold the memories of all.'' \n \n Death nodded and disappeared. I was sure I'd see him again. Maybe in a few milennia. Maybe at the next universe. It did n't really matter to me. `` Seeya buddy. Until we meet again.'' I said to myself. Another wave of life was going to start soon. I had my own work to do.\n"}

He was always doing that shit, telling me stuff offhand and then giving me shit for not hearing him. \n \n `` It's always the Telligarians. Think this belongs in a museum where they can keep it safe instead of out here on this forsaken lump of dirt crawling with vermin.'' \n \n `` Yeah yeah Pops, I got it already. This is like Ranger 101 here, I did four years on Alpha Centari to get my degree, I know this business.'' Geez, what kind of amateur did he think I was? He was a strange one though. Only Terran in this position I'd ever heard of. I always wondered what kind of mods he'd had done on his body to be able to sense the containment fields. It made much more sense to recruit from other species with a better EM spectrum detection and then just wear cloaking devices. He must have been something special back in the day to get this far. \n \n `` Watch it kid, this is n't Ranger School. The Park Service is gon na trust you with all of this when I'm out, so you better learn it right the first time.'' \n \n Just then the radio beeped then emitted a garbled shushing noise. `` Wdhethsheasitusssinovvverhhaseqydh?'' It sounded like maybe it was a question. \n \n `` Dammit, that's Gary. He's standing too close to the warp field generator and getting cross-plane interference. I keep telling him about that, he keeps forgetting. Probably needs to go on break. I'll head up there and spell him for a bit until Alex gets in, do you mind holding it down for yourself over here?'' \n \n `` No prob, I got this. Nothing but cacti and couple clueless Terrans to watch.'' I realized my mistake instantly. \n \n `` People, son, people. We do n't take so kindly to that term,'' Dan said. His voice was mocking but gentle. `` See you in an hour probably. Radio me if you need anything.'' Then he leaped over the canyon rim and activated his powered glide mode, floating away like a leaf in a breeze. Showoff. I can fly too, and without the special suit, but do you see me flitting around everywhere? \n \n Nothing to do now but wait. I picked up my ancient binoculars ( could n't they have gotten me something newer? Breaking in the rookie, I guess ) and lazily scanned the park trails I could see from my position. Nothing but a family of hikers coming up, two adults and a small child. They look Terran, but could have been wearing cloaks like mine. The child swigged from a bottle of water. Definitely Terrans then! Most of the other visitors coming here don \u2019 t drink water, or like myself have more sophisticated methods of staying hydrated. I sighed with mild relief. Dan was so paranoid. No one had made a serious attempt at taking it for at least five years, and it was just some Anaydif kids trying to prank their friends. Didn \u2019 t even have a pocket universe to stuff it into to transport, what were they going to do, tow it home? Pfft. Still, the Galactic Park Service funded a specialist position here, just in case. Hopefully I could do this gig for a few years and then move up to something more prestigious and closer-in. \n \n Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the small family break into a sudden run up to canyon rim. \u201c What the\u2026? \u201d The child chucked something small and silvery out into the air, and there was a shimmer and a crackle over my entire field of vision. \u201c Ohhhh shiiiiiitttt\u2026, \u201d I said to myself as I launched myself toward the trio. It only took a handful of wingbeats to make it to their position. \n \n \u201c Hey, it \u2019 s a Park Service stooge! Too late, dumbass, it \u2019 s ours now! \u201d The child-sized being ( for I was sure now it was no child ) yelled gleefully in my direction as I landed in front of them. \u201c What do they pay you to do this stupid job? Sure doesn \u2019 t attract the brightest ones, does it? \u201d The three beings flickered, and I briefly saw a single form, one that was squat and covered in bright red tentacles. \u201c Roger this, I \u2019 ve disabled the containment. Ready for pickup, \u201d it said, as if speaking to someone else. \n \n My vision went dark, and when the ground shifted under my feet my balance failed and I landed on my ass. When the light came back on, I had to sit down again. It was gone. All of it. Where the canyon had been, there was nothing but a featureless plain. I stared numbly into the distance and feebly plucked a small flower growing near my foot. \n \n The radio crackled. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re in big trouble, kid. \u201d \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` She used to be my best friend . ''\n","story":"He walked, holding the bundle as he approached the grave. The man looked down into the grave he had dug. It was a sad day for a funeral, and here he was, alone. Rain fell quicker now, turning the pile of dirt nearby into mud. He did not move from the spot, shoveling heap upon heap of the now muddy mixture into the hole. He remembered when he first met her. \n \n She was a stray, a young mutt that he had encountered on the road. It was long ago, when he first started to travel that he met her. She wagged her tail as he stood there, and he smiled. He knelt down, and she walked shyly forward, her tail wagging. They had been friends since that very moment, and she walked away from him, just once. She walked into the ditch, and he saw it. He saw her old master, flies buzzing around him as he lay in the ditch. She whined, looking up at him with those brown eyes that he had grown to know so well. The disease had taken many. But it had not taken her. That was an oddity, but then again, so was their meeting. He kept walking, and he heard the familiar patter of her paws on the ground behind him. He smiled, for the first time in a long time. \n \n They had many adventures together, wandering through the decrepit cities.. Meeting people. Hell, he even remembered when she had puppies, and he paused his long session of wandering just to stay there with her. He had played with her puppies, and watched them be parted out in that community. He thought he had finally found love, in that small community, with his little companion. \n \n He felt his anger boil over inside, shaking as he patted the grave with his hands. He stood, knowing that he would take his revenge. Those idiots had gone too far, and it was n't just his dog anymore. They had taken his friends, his new family. He was just sitting there when they rolled up in their gasoline guzzling vehicles, and they started in on his little community, as they always did. He was walking now, lost in his thoughts as he did. \n \n It had all happened when they stopped in front of his worn home, and he looked out the window, watching them carefully. Their old motorcycles guzzled more gas than he could imagine. His daughter sat in the garden in front of the home, nearly 14. She was tending to the garden, and they looked to his dog. She wagged her tail, barking at them, and they began to talk to her. He knew what they wanted. They wanted the dog. The argument grew heated outside, and he walked quickly to the drawer. Gunshots rang out, and he ran outside. He awoke, bruised and beaten, but otherwise unharmed. All of them lied, his daughter choking in a pool of her own blood. He clamped a hand onto the wound, the bullet had gone through her neck. She was trying to speak, but as she choked her last breath away on a clot of blood, the only sound that came out was a scream. \n \n He lifted it out of the drawer, feeling it. He tested the stock, wondering if it was the right choice. He loaded it. When was his birthday again? 1983? He was old, nearly sixty now. But, he finally thought he found happiness in a world stricken with violence, disease, and greed. \n \n He walked, his feet nearly bleeding in their thick wool socks. He had walked for miles, and finally reached the old factory. The weapon weighed steadily in his hand, and he stormed towards the door. He did not care if he was shot. Gunshots rang out. Ten minutes later, enough to end a life, he came out. He smiled, thinking of the graves he had dug at home. He would never live to see his daughter marry a young man. But as he held his side, the wound bleeding. \n \n The disease had taken all that he had at one point. He was walking, his side wrapped up. He had not ate or drank for several days, and his scraggly beard covered his entire face. He passed a puddle, kneeling to drink from it, and he saw a reflection of himself. He reminded himself of one of the diseased dogs that he used to see, the ones that starved as the disease ate them from the inside. He understood their pain now. It was n't the disease itself that consumed him. He was completely immune to it, or so he had thought.He heard a growling noise, looking up to spot a dog, not unlike his old mutt. `` She used to be my best friend, you know.'' He said deliriously. The mutt barked, and raced towards him. Gunfire rang out. \n \n He kept walking.\n"}

Throw me another beer, would you? Do you have any food? Freaking starving, man.'' \n \n `` Look, I still do n't understand what we're doing here,'' Nelson piped up from his seat on the floor, pushing at his glasses. It was a futile gesture, as they immediately slid back down his nose, but he kept on doing it anyway. \n \n I sighed, rubbing my face. `` For the last time, we're starting a company!'' \n \n `` Doing what?'' \n \n `` I do n't know, Nelson,'' I stated through gritted teeth. `` And it does n't matter. The point is that my resume sucks, and I need some sort of halfway decent experience to put on it if I'm ever going to get a job.'' \n \n `` Why get a job, man?'' Jimmy piped in. `` Just stay in college, man! And I'm still waiting on that beer.'' \n \n I pointed at him. `` Come up with an a contribution to this conversation, and I'll think about maybe tossing you a beer.'' \n \n `` So we're starting a company, but we do n't know what it does,'' Nelson repeated slowly, as if he could n't quite wrap his head around the idea. `` It's just to look good on paper. I do n't know how I feel about this, John.'' \n \n For a second, I debated between begging or threatening. Begging won out. \n \n `` Come on, Nelson, we need you!'' I implored, giving him my best puppy-dog eyes. `` You're the only one of us in business school, and we need you to draw up a business plan, maybe some fancy looking documents.'' \n \n `` It's more than that, though,'' Nelson replied. `` We have to make the company do something, so that we can convince employers that it's real.'' \n \n I frowned. `` Why would we ever talk to employers?'' \n \n This time, when he pushed up his glasses, he raised his eyebrows at me as well. `` You're going to put this company on your resume,'' he said. \n \n `` Yeah.'' \n \n `` And you'll give this resume to employers, as proof of your work skills.'' \n \n `` Right.'' \n \n `` And they're going to want to call the other companies for references.'' \n \n `` And? Oh. Ohhhhh.'' \n \n `` There it is,'' Nelson nodded, as if finally breaking through to an especially slow tutoring pupil. `` So we need to actually have the company do something.'' \n \n `` How about delivering weed to folks?'' Jimmy jumped in. `` I always get the munchies at, like, four in the morning, and there's never anyone to come bring me some primo bud!'' \n \n `` Weed's illegal, Jimmy,'' I pointed out. \n \n `` Nah, that's just what the government thinks. But okay, what if you bring other stuff to people.'' \n \n `` Like what?'' \n \n `` I dunno. Pot brownies?'' \n \n I grimaced, but Nelson straightened up a little. `` Hold on. That's not the worst idea.'' \n \n `` Are you kidding?'' I burst out at him. `` You really want us to deliver pot brownies? You're supposed to be the smart one!'' \n \n `` No, no, not the pot part,'' he persisted. `` What about delivering food, though? That's a good business model.'' \n \n I considered this idea. `` There are already pizza places and Chinese food places that deliver.'' \n \n `` Ugh, I ca n't eat Chinese food when I get high,'' Jimmy complained. `` Those chopsticks, man, they freak me out. Like little food spears. I think the kung pow chicken's, like, screaming at me.'' \n \n I rolled my eyes, but Nelson turned towards Jimmy. `` So, when you're baked, what do you want to eat?'' \n \n Jimmy looked up at the ceiling, a misty look in his eyes. `` I dunno, man. Something with just, like, everything on it. Like a deli in a bite. Primo sandwich, with meat, and cheese, and beef, and mayo...'' \n \n `` You're drooling on my couch,'' I pointed out. \n \n `` But he's right, though,'' Nelson pointed out, turning back to me. `` Nowhere around here does sandwich delivery. What if we made a business out of that?'' \n \n `` It sounds more like you're actually suggesting a real company, not a fake one,'' I protested, but Nelson hopped up from the floor, on a roll now. \n \n `` Yeah, and real money's better than fake money!'' he insisted. `` This could work! We'd need some space, and some start-up cash for ingredients, but there are tons of college stoners around here! We could hit a real market with this - sandwiches, delivered!'' \n \n `` And you'd just, like, pick up the phone, and there's the sandwich,'' Jimmy chimed in. `` Freaky, man. Super fast.'' \n \n `` Freaky fast,'' I echoed, starting to feel some of the room's infectious enthusiasm soaking into me. `` Hey, this could maybe work.'' \n \n `` So, do I get that beer yet?'' Jimmy called out. \n \n I got up, grabbing a can out of my fridge, but hesitated before throwing it to him. `` We need a name, though.'' \n \n `` Oh, easy.'' Jimmy pulled himself up into a sitting position on the couch, pointing first at himself, then at me. `` Jimmy. John. Jimmy John's.'' \n \n `` What about Nelson?''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Twisted Paths\n","story":"`` Just walk the path.'' \n \n Frank had stood at the entrance for hours every day since he landed on Kerberos-VII months ago. It was n't on the general survey of the system, but when he landed, it called to something deep inside his being -- pulled him inextricably to the mossy stone archway. Beyond, bathed in a mellow blue light, three-foot stone cubes twisted, shifted, and floated in some unknown march, forming and reforming pathways across a massive underground gorge. \n \n At first, he tried to descend down the rock face, but each time he dropped rope more than a foot beyond the bottom of the cubes, they would swarm the offending cord and slam against its end until he pulled it back above the unmarked boundary. Similar attempts at circumventing the path with a line hooked across the gorge were met with merciless pummeling. His curiosity demanded he know what hid beyond the door at the other side, but primal fear snapped him back from running across during one of the stone's many iterations. \n \n Frank remained though, setting up a base-camp nearby and reporting his extended stay on the planet as, `` necessary floral investigation''. Just as unknown desire drove him to learn the secrets of the path, an equal urge stole away what reason he had concerning proper regulations. Each pre-human artifact found was to be reported and quarantined, but Frank needed this more than some survey position at Galactic Exploration LLC, and he was n't going to let some suits have their jab at the path first. \n \n None of that had changed his cowardice in facing down the twisting death-trap that buzzed in front of him now. Technology either failed or fizzled in examining the pattern the stones used to form each new iteration. Whether by design or insanity, the path was greater than the sum total of human advancement. It had beaten everything else, and so Frank determined it required a less logical approach. So he stood at the entrance, day-in and day-out for several weeks. Just staring. He hoped that doing so would allow his fear to sate, to form some bond of courage in the face of the puzzle. \n \n The time had come. Whether he was ready or not did n't matter, it was do-or-die. `` Just walk the path.'' Frank took the first step onto the stones without hesitation. A cacophony of gray rock flew about him as he took his second step, but he did n't falter. Like hornets they whizzed by, snagging his clothes and twisting his body at times as he stepped. \n \n Somewhere mid-way, Frank noticed a stone careening toward his current stone. Most of them moved about to his sides, yet this one came head-on toward the walk-way he was moving along. Searching in desperation, Frank looked for an off-shoot to the path, but none had formed in this iteration. Forward was the sole way, and in seconds that way would find itself reshaped by this new painful addition. \n \n Frank did the only thing he could think of. He screamed. The cry echoed off the stones, down the gorge into the unknowable gray below, probably out into the field beyond the stone archway. Eyes closed, he waited the breaths-worth of life he had left. Yet the moment never arrived, no feeling of stone slamming against his skin. No cracking of bones, or tumble down into the abyss below. When he finally opened his eyes, the stone floated like a bubble inches from his face. He pressed a palm against the stone, its chilled, rough surface grating under his touch. A wild thought wormed its way into his mind, and Frank gave a light push. \n \n The stone drifted a few feet forward then froze mid-air, hanging -- a stone fruit waiting to be plucked. He shifted several other nearby stones, sending them skittering forward with similar results. All the fear slipped away, falling down below to be forgotten with the old Frank -- the man controlled by those emotions. Stones danced in his hands, and the path bent and formed into a walkway to the other side. Stepping down onto the ledge, Frank let out a heavy breath, and pushed against the carved door with a strength free of doubt and fear. \n \n A warm glow snaked through the crack that formed around the frame edge until it consumed Frank as he stepped into the golden light beyond. \n \n\n"}

When you approach the whole event from Jason's perspective of security, it's less shocking when he suddenly throws someone in a bathroom and throws a couple rounds in their chest. It also felt like that action scene could have been written to be more fast paced, like in the original. The other thing I liked about the first one was that when you clicked the action switch on, the pace kept going. Throws rounds into her chest, realizes the target is about to die, etc. I feel like this scene could be written to be a great intro for a book or short story or whatever ( maybe after another chapter that kinda foreshadows but does n't obviously let you know about the secret security side of the story ). That little part where you do n't know what's going on when he starts shooting people really keeps it exciting\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines . A densely populated city has become a war-zone , but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them\n","story":"As I exited my house that morning, I could n't help but shake my head at the view. *And this used to be such a good neighborhood, too*. I took a sip of coffee as I watched the sentry tanks roll past on the street, and sighed at the way Dan almost had to slow down to avoid hitting one as he pulled out of his driveway. *What an inconvenience. I hope he files a Complaint against that one*, I thought to myself. *In fact, maybe I should submit one too, on his behalf. Just to make sure*. \n \n I juggled my coffee mug hand to hand as I searched my pockets for my car keys, doing my best to ignore the massive anti-air model as it thundered across my lawn, searching in vain for a target to fire at which did n't run the risk of endangering the Overseers that hovered overhead. I frowned at the scuff marks it left in the grass - a few months ago that hunk of metal would've been scrapped for doing even less damage to a human's property. But apparently the war was really heating up, and congress had just pushed through a new set of bills upping the limits on collateral damage. *Fucking morons*, I thought morosely. *Just because THEY do n't live in the middle of a goddamn war zone, they have no idea what it's like for the rest of us*. The cleaner drones would n't be around to replace the damaged sod for at *least* another two hours. I could almost feel the property value draining away. \n \n I was about to hop into my car when a couple of robots, entwined in combat, landed heavily in the middle of the road in front of my house. As they hammered away at each other I kept a close eye on the asphalt beneath them - if they did significant damage to the road it would be grounds for a Complaint, and might even get me out of a day of work. I could n't be expected to drive to work through dangerous conditions, which a pothole certainly qualified as. After all, humans are unique, superior, and we could n't be risked if there was the chance of danger. \n \n The loud **crack! ** and sudden stinging sensation in my hand startled me out of my reverie. My loud curse was instinctive, as I stared in shock at the shattered pieces of my ceramic travel mug, now lying on the driveway. *That- what-* My thoughts returned in a rush as I suddenly realized... *I'd been damaged! * \n \n A sudden stillness descended on the world around me at almost the same time as my realization, as all nearby robotic activity came to an abrupt halt. Into the stillness descended the Overseers, stepping lightly out of their personal anti-grav units as they reached the ground in front of me. The man approached me as his partner - a much younger woman, probably straight out of Education - hustled across the street to where the two robots I had noticed earlier stood frozen, still locked in a parody of combat. \n \n `` Sir, have you been damaged?'' The Overlord's voice was calm, soothing, but I was n't in the mood to be soothed. I held up my trembling hand so that the Overseer could clearly see the slice - *nearly a quarter-inch long! * \n \n `` Damaged? Damaged?!'' I dimly noted that my voice had risen to a near shriek, but it was all just so overwhelming. `` I might lose my hand!'' I caught sight of my broken mug and pointed accusingly. `` And my property! I demand to - I... I feel...'' \n \n I feel... wet? I looked down, and could only mewl in horror at the sight of the coffee stain spreading across the front of my beautiful dress shirt. I could feel tears prickling my eyes, and I might have fallen if the second Overlord had n't suddenly been there to support me. She grabbed my hand in hers, examining it briefly before letting it drop to my side again, and turning to her partner. \n \n `` A mild laceration - no lasting damage'' she reported firmly. I started to feel anger, pushing away my fear and confusion. *Mild? I'd show her mild. This had gone far beyond a Complaint now*. \n \n `` What happened? Who was the perpetrator?'' I barely recognized my own voice. So powerful, so forceful! I could n't help but preen a little in the face of my own commanding presence. The older Overseer sighed, but fiddled with his control bracelet. Across the street one of the robots straightened, disentangling himself from his combat partner and moved to kneel on the grass in front of me. \n \n The woman Overseer snapped to attention. *Definitely straight out of Education, this one*. `` It appears that you were struck by a stray bolt, sir, wrenched from this robot during battle and launched by the violence of his engagement''. \n \n I had to admit that the forcefulness of her report was somewhat intimidating, but I stared her down. `` This seems like a clear cut case of Improper Maintenance to me, Overseer''. Her face stayed stony but her lips thinned angrily, and it was her partner who spoke up. \n \n `` I would have to agree, sir. This robot failed to properly maintain himself, which resulted in harm to a human''. The Overseer sighed heavily, but finally reluctantly continued. `` As the injured party, it is of course your right to decide this robot's fate''. \n \n I looked at him in confusion. *Was n't it obvious? * But as neither Overlord spoke up for several long moments, I realized that I would have to state it anyways. `` For an infraction of this size, only the robot's destruction would suffice''. \n \n I did n't think it was possible, but the woman Overlord straightened even further to attention, somehow finding another few inches to add to her height. `` Such a punishment is within your rights. But this robot is of a model valuable to the war effort, and it would be a help to our cause if you would reconsider''. Her partner avoided my surprised glance by studiously examining his fingernails, and I was left to simply shake my head. What cause could compare to that of human safety? She would learn eventually. \n \n `` Shall we get on with it then?'' I said, finally. `` This has been a very long morning for me, and I still have to get to a hospital before I can go in to the office''. \n \n The male Overlord sighed again, but began tapping at his control bracelet. Within moments, a strange hum became audible as the Overlord removed the inhibitors ensuring proper electrical levels throughout the robot's body. \n \n The robot took a long time to die, shrieking shrilly as the electrical surge slowly burned out its processors. I spent the time trying to calculate whether the ceramic shards from my coffee mug lying in the driveway constituted enough of a hazard to driving that I would be able to requisition an anti-grav unit for my trip to the hospital. As the minutes passed, I felt the pride welling up inside me. Despite the horrors I had been through in the last hour, I had handled myself well, and had even removed a dangerous menace from the streets! That robot would never harm another human. \n \n After all, humans are unique. We ca n't be built, we ca n't be replaced. We must be protected at all costs. There is no robot who is, or ever will be, as valuable - as irreplaceable - as the lowliest human. \n \n Even if they are just as intelligent.\n"}

At least not until the German 6^^th showed up. \n \n I'd never killed anyone, I'd never lead an army. I've never gotten anything more than a parking ticket. I lead a quiet life, and had retired to a nice homestead in TX. I always head dying was different for everyone, but never really expected this. \n \n On the 23^^rd of August at 7.42 pm my phone range. In a thick German accent with heavy static there came a voice: \n \n > This is Generalfeldmarschall Fridrich Paulus. Your time has come. You can not stand against us. Lay down your arms and come peacefully. There is no need for escalation or wanton destruction. As a show of good faith I will stay my troops for 48 hours while you deliberate. \n \n Lay down my arms? What did he mean? I do n't own any guns.

Come to think of it that was many years ago & she has been by my side ever since. \n \n Oh well, I'm sure she will get along well with my neighbors who would take good care of her. If it was my time it was my time.

I drive it into the ground in frustration. `` I am a frail old man, will you not permit me the use of my...'' \n \n I could n't quite finish my sentence. I realized there was a singing.

With Soviets dying and what seemed like a never ending supply replacing them. \n \n Paulus and his troops had taken most of my home, but were never able to push into the gardens. \n \n And finally we were able to push back. It was grueling work, but we found a way. Horrible casualties mounted on each side, but we had a never ending supply of Soviets to reinforce us. \n \n Eventually we had the 6^^th army encircled. And now it was time for me to demand the surrender of Paulus. But it was never truly Paulus.... \n \n As he approached me the death head emblem on his cap morphed, encapsulating and becoming his own face.

However they did nothing to ease the mood of the lone visitor to the man's dismally empty hospital room. The sounds of the gaunt man's shallow breathing matched the electronic beeping of the impassive medical equipment.

But you need to keep quiet. \u201d His face was hidden by the shadows, his white teeth which seemed too sharp and perfect, were gleaming lightly. \n \n The girl let out a muffled cry, her tear stained face crumpled in pain. She wanted to see his face, she *needed* to see his face. And even if it weren \u2019 t obscured by shadows she was sure that if she could see it she would go crazy. Her red ringed eyes, bloodshot and puffy, stood out bulging from their sockets. She let out a lungful of air through her nose, because her mouth was stuffed, and bloody snot flowed down her mouth and chin. She cried out again, the sounds caught behind the rag, oily and dirty, that was stuffed with great force into her mouth. \n \n Each breath was getting harder to come by now, her nose plugging up with blood and mucous. She tried to calm herself, she was sure that she was going to die and so this was not an easy task. \n \n He said again, \u201c you need to keep quiet, \u201d his voice was soft, low, and without any urgency. \u201c You don \u2019 t want to wake mother do you? \u201d His face was still cloaked in the shadows but his teeth still seemed to shine, reflecting light that wasn \u2019 t there. \n \n The girl shook her head side to side, *no, I don \u2019 t want to wake mother.

It illuminated this cold dank cellar with its bare concrete walls, a few wet cracks in the floor that she could see, and the metal ring that was secured to the floor through which the chain that held her here was fed through. A small padlock held the chain around her ankle. By now, all her moving, straining, and twisting had rubbed the skin bare causing it to blister and bleed. It was infected; it had to be by now. \n \n She had lost all sense of time since waking up here. But in all the senseless time that she had spent down here she had pieced together *how* she \u2019 d ended up in this unfortunate, desolate, and terrifying situation. She remembered the party she was at. Her friend Nancy had landed that elusive job she \u2019 d dreamed of since she was a child and her parents had taken her to France. The job entailed traveling the world and writing about it, reviewing hotels, local hot spots, and everything in between. \n \n She remembered showing up to the going away party for her friend. She only had two drinks; she wanted to be alright to drive home because she had her own job to get to in the morning. Nancy \u2019 s boyfriend had invited his and her friends to the shindig. That must be where this faceless man fits in to the puzzle, she thought, because she \u2019 d never seen him before. Even now she couldn \u2019 t remember what his face had looked like that night. As strange as that was, but she chalked it up to the drug he had slipped her. \n \n Then\u2026she was here. Where ever *this* was. This cold dark room. This cellar. \n \n \u201c Now, \u201d the man said, \u201c Kelly\u2026.Kelly, Kellybobelly\u2026 \u201d he laughed, soft, *crazily* Kelly would say. \u201c Now, don \u2019 t even say *again* that this hurts.

They looked so sharp. *Yes, * she thought, *it could hurt a lot more. * \n \n \u201c Well then, \u201d he said. \u201c Let \u2019 s get started shall we? \u201d \n \n There was something in Kelly \u2019 s mind, something deep down, that screamed out like a shrieking wraith and filled her head with an unbearable pain. She couldn \u2019 t stand it anymore, she had a feeling, a premonition maybe, that this wasn \u2019 t going to last much longer, that soon, very soon this sick fuck was going to tire of her and then what? \n \n *You know damn well what missy, * she thought fighting through the pain in her head, *he \u2019 s going to kill you and then stalk the streets for someone else to bring down here. Bring her down here, sneaking her past \u201c mother \u201d. * \n \n The man leaned forward, his cold hand reaching out to touch her breast. Kelly \u2019 s skin crawled at the thought of that corpse like touch. She spat the rag out, working her jaw to get it up and out of the back of her throat. The rag hit the floor with a wet thud. The man looked down, the teeth disappearing in a scowl. He opened his mouth to say something, but Kelly decided to show him her teeth. \n \n Kelly leaned forward and sank her teeth to the gums in his cold clammy thigh. Blood pooled readily around her mouth and she clamped her throat shut disgusted at the thought of even swallowing a drop. The man let out a startled and pained cry. \n \n \u201c You bitch! \u201d he yelled. \n \n Kelly groped a hand through the darkness and up his thigh. She found what she was looking for in the sweaty area between his legs and she twisted and she squeezed and she dug her nails into the hairy flesh as hard as she could and she could feel blood and maybe what is kept in those tender little plums, run down her hand. \n \n The man shrieked in pain, screaming about the mother he was apparently so worried about waking. \n \n Kelly \u2019 s teeth found him again and again and again, finally finding his jugular. The blood was salty, coppery, and it pooled all around her now flowing in a great river from the wound. Kelly searched in the dim light coming from the bulb for the key that would grant her her freedom. After a long nervous moment she found it in the back pocket of shorts that the man had discarded when he walked in. She unlocked herself from her chain, stood on wobbly legs and raced as fast as those numb legs would take her for the door to the cellar. \n \n She came up the stairs that led to the cellar and found herself in a dark, damp, mouldy smelling house. All the curtains had been drawn. There was a reading room between her and the front door. In it was a leather chair enshrouded in shadows. A figure sat in the chair. She could tell this even in the darkness. Kelly moved slowly, her heart in her throat. \n \n *It \u2019 s mother, * she thought. She shuffled her feet; the old hardwood floor creaked softly under her weight. Dust gathered between her toes. She got closer to the chair and the smell hit her like a kick in the chest. Mother was nothing more than a bloated decaying sack of flesh splitting at the seams. \n \n Kelly started to scream. She ran to the door, the sunlight hitting her for the first time in what felt like forever. And she ran, bloody and mostly naked, she ran and ran and ran. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ EU ] This is the story of a man named Michael . Michael worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 432 . Employee Number 432 's job was simple : he sat at his desk and sharpened pencils ... .\n","story":"They say that any man, given enough practice, will perfect an action through the elimination of the expenditure of unnecessary energy. This can be seen throughout time in martial artists, scientists and other men of discipline and motivation. This can also be seen in the study of subject 432, Michael. \n \n The company was merely a front for some *maybe not perfectly legal* human psychological experimentation. Organisations would pay top dollar to learn the effects of unfulfilling, menial repetitive labour on the human brain. Word was that the CIA had also dropped a hefty chunk of change into the study. There was a guy that always washed clothing. There was a guy that always sorted mail. There was a guy that always sorted files. There was a guy that always washed floors. There was a guy that always sharpened pencils. \n \n The guys were n't always the same, sometimes they were girls, sometimes they were fat, thin, black, white, lost, found, whatever. But the job, the job was always the same. \n \n The research was, for the most part, unremarkable. It seemed that humans driven to repetitive and mind numbing labour would fall into one of three categories. The first was the **worker bee**, they would put there head down and slog away, unfocussed, uncaring, just soaking in paychecks and struggling to find that box where they had put all the fucks they used to give. The second was the **existential crisis**, they had a full mental breakdown before declaring to no one in particular that they were off to travel the world and reinvent themselves. The third was the **lemming** group. These, after becoming less and less motivated, and possibly more affected by the cocktail of chemicals and hormones drifting in the company coffee, leapt from the top of the building. Some of the more macabre researchers ran a betting pool for which of the company cars would be the next to catch a lemming on their glorious final dive. It was of course agreed by all the participants that if the poor soul did not manage to hit a car, that the round of bets would be donated to the local disabled-puppy-rehabilitation-centre-and-school-for-the-blind. \n \n And then there was Michael. Michael had conducted his first experiment upon entering the workplace by not sharpening any pencils. This would result in a kind assistant popping in ever thirty minutes, demonstrating the pencil sharpening, and then asking Michael to sharpen them. There was also a small dock in pay that was more motivating than it should have been. After conducting a few more experiments, Michael had learned the following. There were twenty pencils in a tray. If he sharpened them twenty more would fall from the ceiling. After he had sharpened a hundred pencils, they would be collected. He could of course also choose to not hand over the pencils, or the shavings, and it was possible to hoard these in the room. He could bring things into the room, but could not remove anything from the room. He could ask for as much food and refreshment as he wanted as long as he met his quota. He walked in at 8, out at 5, with the day's pay in his hands, always 8 - 5. \n \n So it came to be that Michael, sitting on a throne of sharpened pencils, watched as his capuchin underlings toiled away, sharpening the never ending stream of pencils that fell from the sky. The four monkeys took it in turns to sharpen the pencils, two on two off. At the moment, Michael was teaching the other two how to fence, and soon he would give them rudimentary instruction on the creation of fire. While he never drank the coffee himself, he had been giving it to two of the monkeys. The other two were control monkeys, because two jacked monkeys was manageable but four was going a bit far. Soon they would begin to breed and his goal of world domination would slink one step closer.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] It 's been 300 years since Mars was colonized . Now , there is a revolution and the colonies are fighting for their independance . The first space battle in human history is about to begin .\n","story":"`` We are approaching the Laviathan sir.'' \n \n `` All crews to their transports.'' \n \n Sam was part of Charlie squadron, in a crew of four. They raced to their transport to strap in for the ride out. Charlie was to slip in the center of the station from the north and drop off the payloads in the middle, where the smaller grav would n't hinder them. Then they were to make their way to the bridge. The battle would be won or lost based on who had control of Laviathan. \n \n 3. 2. 1. \n \n The transport detached from their spinning carrier, being pointed at their target at the time to conserve fuel. Sam found it amusing to think that anyone would care when there would n't be any kind of retreat anyways. Besides, it meant his transport was in front, and most likely to be shot at. \n \n Standing in the cargo box in his armor, Sam closed his eyes and tried to relax. The plan required a boarding party to take the Laviathan, while the cruisers would move in to present formidable enough problems for the station that it would be forced to ignore the transports. Of course the captain of the station might just decide they could shrug off the firepower and focus only on the boarding party. That meant the cruisers had to hit hard enough to threaten destruction. \n \n *Nothing like boarding a ship while actively trying to destroy it. * \n \n After half an hour he could feel transport rock and their pilot came in their headsets `` hold tight, here we go.'' They were immobilized in their armor so there was no point in holding on to anything, but the sentiment was nice. \n \n Then he felt the first jerk. \n \n Spin and turn, he could only sit and feel the effects on his body and hope that after suffering through this, they did n't just get shot out of the sky. He opened his eyes to look at the other three. Justin, the new guy, had his eyes squeezed tight and face tensed up. Sergeant, also with her eyes closed but saying something to herself. Or maybe just singing. Then Ruth. She had spent more time in space than any of them and just looked bored. \n \n Ruth turned and smiled grimly at Sam before turning to look back at nothing. \n \n Suddenly there was a vibration and the jerking stopped. He looked over at Ruth who was frowning now, and then their com came on. \n \n `` We've been hit and most of our engines are down. We are falling towards the Laviathan and will make impact in thirty seconds. I will use what thrusters we have to give you a good entryway. Good luck.'' \n \n He said it with that infuriating calm, even as Sam thought about how fast they must be going in, and how the bastard was no doubt watching the damn station coming up. There was some small force on his body that told him the captain was indeed still using some thrusters. \n \n `` Brace for impact.'' \n \n Empty words, locked in as he was, but he appreciated at least knowing when it was coming. \n \n The transport banged as Sam was slammed around in his suit. They must have either been going slow enough not to kill them all or fast enough to simply go through some of the outer hull, because Sam was immediately aware of aching body parts. Then he felt the vibration of the boarding spikes extending from their cargo pod. \n \n `` This is it, let's go'' the Sargent was attentive and ready to go. Their locks came off and all four activated weapon systems, all while moving about, both to make sure they could but also just for the relief of being able to. The door in the floor opened, they had arrived.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ IP ] Running to the end\n","story":"I could feel the gravel grind under my sneaker, as I pushed off to start my run across the 10 miles that lay ahead of me. The air was very cool and crisp, the sky lit only by the pale moonlight. It was absolutely breathtaking. \n \n \n I could feel the cool air rush along every hair on my arm, the gravel felt amazing under thin, worn out sneakers. I had been training on this same route for the last 5 weeks. \n \n \n I woke up from a dream, that night that I first started running. I had been putzing around with running for years now. But that dream, left me determined. In the dream, I was in a cloud of white smoke. It was cool, just like the air tonight, and my legs felt just as they do now too. Strong and lean. In fact, my entire body felt strong and lean. The dream left me feeling as though I was literally chasing my dreams, taking advantage of the life that I had. Something good was going to come my way, I could just feel it. \n \n \n Tonight I was what felt like 5 minutes into the run, when i reached my turn around point. It was at a small tree, in the middle of this barren field of gravel and weeds. The branches were bare, but looked gorgeous under the moonlight. I stopped to admire the beauty, as my breath turned into white vapor as it left my mouth. I took one step closer towards the tree, my foot crunching the snow that lay beneath. I had n't seen that before, but the sound was comforting. \n \n I ran my fingertips along the trunk of the tree, which was cold and wet from the snow, just to see that it was real. Just to see confirm that I had made it there tonight. \n \n I turned around, and set off my run back. I could hear howling behind me, as a white smoke started to swirl around me. It felt strange, but good. It pushed me more. As I ran, I felt myself getting lighter and lighter. I could hear footsteps running along either side of me. I looked to my left and right. There are wolves running along side me. I did n't know what was going on, I felt a little frightened, but kept going as the white cloud pulled me along. I finally stopped myself, This felt insane. \n \n I twirled around as the cloud of smoke disappeared, the wild animals on either side of me take off to my left. I'm in the middle of the gravel field completely alone, as I remember: I was bit by a werewolf years ago. My eyes dart straight to full moon that was just uncovered by the clouds, and then too the ground in a panic. I see the sneakers I'm leaving behind.... as my own thoughts fade and I feel myself drift along to follow the pack.....\n"}

You eagerly count down the seconds then shriek in horror as you are given a power no one would ever want to be stuck with .\n","story":"We call them superpowers, but that's just for fun. You ca n't get `` weather control'' or `` teleportation'' from a mutation, it's nonsensical. People normally get stronger muscles, better eyesight, perfect pitch, quicker healing, seeing a funny joke in every situation, that kind of thing. Ordinary abilities, boosted. \n \n At the extremes, they start to be like superpowers - extreme understanding makes someone *very* clever, some lung adaptations enable breathing seawater, and several people have such an uncanny way of reading the thoughts and intent behind face and body microexpressions that it may as well be telepathy. \n \n We were sitting around the TV, waiting for midday; my 18th birthday and me trying not to look nervous. I could n't for the life of me tell you what was on TV, apart from the clock in the corner. I could n't decide if it would be better to hope for some extreme and cool power but then feel the responsibility to use it to help as many people as possible, or something bland like a backup set of adult teeth, but be able to carry on living normally - let the responsibility go to someone else. \n \n At 11:59:25, the front door opened as the doorbell rang. Four people ran in, one flashing an ID badge, two alert and armed, one civilian. `` Emergency power defence team'' Mr ID badge shouted. `` Sammy'', he gestured at the civilian, `` has paralyzed you. One of our team can predict the appearance of certain powers, and lead us here. We're taking over until we know what we're dealing with, I'm sorry for the interruption''. He looked at his watch. 11:59:55. \n \n Five seconds. Nobody moved. \n \n 11:59:58, all the windows shattered. Two more people were in the room, one of them pointing at a guard, who raised his gun at me and pulled the trigger. \n \n I screamed. \n \n A portal appeared underneath me and my chair began to fall into it. \n \n `` NO!'' cried Mr ID badge, the armed guard, and the supersonic flying person. The civilian double agent ran at me, pushing me down into the portal and following me through while the others were unable to act. \n \n `` Several people interested in your power. Interested enough to reveal some very advanced abilities. Your power has only appeared twice before - and one of those people died for it. Every government wants it.'' \n \n My power... oh yes I have it now! I have... something to do with energy? `` I do n't really understand it'', I said. \n \n The civilian double-agent smiled wryly. `` It's a particular kind of small-scale telekinesis. One so valuable, you'll never be allowed any freedom again. Congratulations, you can give your government the Trillion dollar gift of energy-independence and incredible weaponry by concentrating very very hard and stabilising cold fusion reactions. Well, I say your government, it was n't actually *your* government who won that one. Welcome to North Korea, by the way''. \n \n I screamed again. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write a horror story in which the main character is a def man\/woman . The gruesome twist at the end correlates to his\/her inability to hear .\n","story":"People always called my deafness a disability, but I never believed them. I always saw it as a gift. I saw things other people missed, I felt things others ignored. \n \n When the alien invasion came, people scrambled to fight them. They never stood a chance, though. Their technology was insufficient to damage the aliens, their advanced camouflage suits, or their ships. The last broadcast on the television read nothing but `` Good night, and good luck. We all need it.'' \n \n Over the years, I learned by watching. I learned the aliens' greatest weakness was they assumed humans were all made the same, like they themselves were. They did not realize that we are each unique. I watched as many men and women tried to break into the alien's ships, only to fall down and die. Those close enough to the cannon fodder would writhe in pain, but it never affected me. \n \n I learned, much later, that the aliens had abducted people, experimented on them, and come to some conclusions: 1 ) human rely on both sight and hearing, 2 ) by overriding the brain pathways through one of these means, the humans were disabled, and 3 ) sound was their preferred method. \n \n I was born with a rare birth defect; I've been deaf since before my birth. I was born without eardrums. So I learned by watching and touching. I learned to identify when the aliens were close, when they were arming their weapons, by the feel of the ground just before they struck. \n \n So I watched, and I waited, and when the opportunity came, I broke into their ship. The sound-defense did not work on me -- I had no eardrums to route information to my brain. When I got to the command-control center, I knew the buttons to press, because I had watched them. \n \n After I had hacked into their mother-ship and implanted a self-destruct with no manual override code to activate ten minutes hence with no countdown -- hidden in the background of the operating system, I watched as their suits and their ships exploded. \n \n The world was in turmoil for several years afterwards, until a simple woman from an ambiguous background started to bring order to the chaos. The rules were strict, swiftly enforced, with no mercy. But this brought a sort of peace. Peace through fear. \n \n I watched as this newly elected President of the United World Confederacy signed her acceptance speech, with a verbal translator present. It was only the deaf that truly understood, however. The last line was not `` Good night; good luck. We all need.'' It was `` Good night; good luck. You all need.''\n"}

When Hiro's powers burst into being, I, Yamamoto Yamato, was left behind. His forced humility and my ambitious jealousy created a rift between the two of us. Once childhood friends, we became distant strangers. \n \n When I again met Oda Hiro, it was in highschool, where he had the best grades, was captain of the soccer and baseball teams, and beloved by ever yan, tsun and kuudere for twelve miles around. I, Yamamoto Yamato, was a shut-in who played video games and watched anime, mostly shounen, or ones about cute girls doing cute things, or ones based on Light Novels -- it is important to capitalize that term if you're a true fan. I had renounced the highschool life after being bullied on my first day, as they called me `` Two-Power Toto'', forgetting that most of my name is Yama, and one day I will drop mountains on their heads. My two powers -- Psychic Background Music and Drawing Stares -- were the most useless I could have ever thought of. Meanwhile, Hiro was blessed with fire breath, super strength, flight, summoning katanas, a mecha from ancient Egypt, and a blood bond with the moon princess. We were as night and day, if the night were lacking stars and the moon also only appeared during the day. \n \n When I last met Oda Hiro, it was during the eleventh episode of the anime series one of my minions directed by my order, and that's how I realized something was wrong.

Most did n't even report it, and the ones that did barely had me as a footnote! \n \n When I first met Sailor Vegeta, I, Yamamoto Yamato, realized how small my world had been, and how much bigger the fish -- that is, the true villains -- were out there in the world, the galaxy, all dimensions. Above all, I realized that Hiro had been Destined to defeat them, even if Destiny had never taken note of me, allowing me to defeat Hiro before he could meet his Destiny.

The sand on the other side of the island has already grown muddy and wet. I can still go spearfishing, but wood that could suffice for fire is growing thin. The glass bottle of wine beside me holds fresh water, but the lip of it have grown thin from repeated use. I'm sure it'll crack against my dry lips on day. \n \n I fan the flames on what little fire is left from last night, and hold my palms up to the flame. \n \n I remember the softness of her skin as I took her, the warmth of her body rising through her cold and prickled skin. I waved my hands in the air, trying to recreate the sensations of that night... the way her thighs rose to the touch of my fingertips, the glimmer of the stars reflected in the black of her eyes. Her breath rose in silver spindles against the cold, dark sky, and I followed it to meet her lips. \n \n `` It's a bit chilly,'' she giggled nervously. `` Would n't you rather go inside?'' \n \n `` Are you nervous someone might see us?'' I asked, reaching my hand behind her neck, and pulling her to my lips before she could answer. I could feel the wetness that matted her hair, the moistness on her back from the sea spray that had lined the deck we were lying on. I grabbed the bottle of wine beside us and took a swig before offering it to her as well. \n \n It was a *vintage*. *100-years old, * it claimed in thin, swooping letters etched on the side of the bottle. It tasted like a two-buck chuck, nonetheless. Her father produced millions of these every year, under several labels, and with a few dollars here and there, the finest connoisseurs and critics forfeited the truth of their tongue and gave it the highest praise. \n \n Footsteps echoed around the bend and she dashed to her feet, pushing me off of her. `` It's one of the guards. They realized we're not in our rooms! I told you we should go back inside!'' \n \n `` Your father would n't have let me visit you in your room!'' \n \n She dashed to hide behind a dark corner of the ship and I chased after her, panting from the excitement. `` Idiot! We almost got caught!'' she pushed on my chest. `` My father would have killed us if he found out!'' \n \n `` Your father intends to kill me anyways,'' I said. \n \n `` Yeah, but not me!'' She smiled, devilishly, as she said it. \n \n I pressed myself against her. The footsteps were just around the corner, growing closer, and somehow the fear that should have been at play instead only made me more bold, more excited. I reached around her and held her against my body. `` We're getting married as soon as the boat lands, anyways. What's the difference?'' \n \n She was about to yelp, but caught the sound in her throat. Glaring at me, she whispered, as angrily as she could muster `` Do n't you dare! You can wait, you dog!'' She smiled then and gave me a gentle kiss on my neck. \n \n Then the fear washed over her as she pushed me away and pointed to the spot we were just lying at. `` Our wine, you nitwit! You left it out there'' \n \n `` Crap!'' I yelled, peaking around the corner to see if I could dive for it. \n \n The footsteps turned the corner and I could see the sailor's flashlight. He stopped at the back of the ship and placed the flashlight on the ground, stepping on it with his foot to keep it from rolling off with the bucking of the waves. Turning to face the starboard side of the ship, he unzipped his pants and began to relieve himself from the side of the railing. \n \n I eased my way towards the bottle, as quiet but quick as I could manage. Just as I took my last step to reach down for it, the boat shook with a thunderous crash. I could hear steel bending, creaking from the front of the ship. \n \n The horn of the ship blew three times. A rogue wave. Shit. \n \n I turned and made eye contact with the guard, who, was still mid-whiz but was now gripping onto the railing for his life. The ship bucked like a bull, throwing itself into the sky, and I was thrown from the back, right between the railings and into the water. \n \n I struggled to stay afloat, and between the battering of the waves, I could hear my fiance' screaming, and the horn of the boat growing further and further away. \n \n I had woken up on this pitifully small island, the bottle of wine I `` rescued'' just inches from myself, half-filled with sand-muddled seawater. \n \n I had waited two months on that ship, counting down for the moment it would land and we could claim each other as husband and wife. I still remember the date of our proposed wedding. It's been a year now since that date passed. The animalistic scratchings on the rocks around me remind me so every day. \n \n I shake off my thoughts and walk to the other end of the island, spear in my hand. I sing the same song to myself every time I go to hunt, either to keep my sanity or to provoke it's loss, I'm not sure. But between the words, I hear a faint clinking from the rocks nearby. \n \n A little sparkle of emerald shines against the grey stones and I walk over to investigate the noise. \n \n A bottle. The engraving on the side reads *100-years old*, but I can tell from the familiarity of the letters, that *101* would be more accurate, by now, at least. \n \n Inside is a thin letter, dried with age, and even before prying it open I can tell what's written inside. \n \n `` You're late for our wedding. Hurry back home to me, or my father will kill you.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A man leaves his nightly shower with the thoughts and ideas on how to change his life , except this time his conviction is maintained after he opens the shower door .\n","story":"Sam thoroughly washed his body parts a couple of extra times as he was finishing up in the shower. \n \n The sudden realization that his life was now his to manage has over empowered him. Sam knew that he could turn his and his children's life around. He had a lot of help from friends and family. \n \n He opens the shower door and reaches for the towel but his hand returns empty handed. Odd, he knew that he grabbed one and put it on the towel rack. \n \n He stood in the shower letting the moisture fall off of him. He carefully stepped out of the shower and started to walk in the direction of the towels, only to be shocked by his wife, Becky. \n \n Becky's legs were propped up against the sink as she was leaning. Her skinny jeans fit well around her slender body. Hair was full of water, bringing out the darkness of her sandy blond hair. Blood shattered the beauty in her green eyes. Her posture showed an odd mixture of anxiety and pleasure. Sam knew that she was on drugs. \n \n `` What are you doing here, how did you get in?'' Sam inquired. The last time his eyes shed a glance on her was over 3 months ago. She was being taken away by the cops after coming after him with a knife. No one was hurt, and he was lucky that his kids had the courage to stand up for their father, confirming his accusations. \n \n He had a restraining order put against her shortly afterwards. He tried to serve her with divorce papers, but he had no listed address to server her with. \n \n `` Timothy let me in, he said that he misses mommy and loves her more than daddy. I persuaded him that I would save him from your abusive habits if he let me in. So here I am.'' Becky scowled. \n \n It was all a lie. She always fabricated stories to make herself look good. It was his greatest pet peeve of her's. Months ago he thought he had the courage to stand up to her. His emotions said otherwise as he was headed further into depression. The only thing that made him look forward to the next day is knowing that his kids needed him. He tried to reconcile with his wife, and tried getting her mental help; but she was nowhere to be found after being released from her initial hearing. Sam had no idea where she was. Until now. \n \n `` I doubt he said that. What are you doing here!? You need to leave now, there is a RO out against you and I will call the cops.'' Sam threatened. this was his awakening. His sudden realization that he needed to provide the children with a healthier parent. And he needed to be that parent. \n \n Becky released his towel hostage and threw it at him. `` Whatever, you never could stand up for me anyways. After you dared call the cops on me, I realized that you never loved me! No one calls the cops on their spouse if they love them as much as I did to you! But you betrayed me, like a coward!'' She left the bathroom and headed towards the children's room where their children, Timothy and Susan were playing. Sam quickly put on his towel and followed. Timothy was six and Susan just turned nine. Neither of them could quite understand the situation. The downside was that they did n't know how to say no to mommy. Sam did n't think they would need to be tested, but this shower has proven otherwise. \n \n `` Oh yeah, I'm taking the kids, permanently.'' Becky announced. \n \n `` No you wo n't! You ca n't! They are covered under the Restraining Order as well!'' \n \n A stranger's voice came from the children's room. `` Yes she can, as long as I have something to do with it.'' A man came into view. He was rather scrawny, deep voice, heavily tattooed and had those ridiculous ear gauges. His eyes were also staring down the sights of a Glock 17, barrel aimed at Sam's head. \n \n Blood and anger rushed everywhere. Sam could n't believe it. This was it, there was nothing he could do. He was n't going to see his kids again, and worse, he was helpless to help them. The consequences of him taking a shower with his kid's unsupervised stormed through his mind. How could he be so negligent? He could have called a neighbor to watch his kids. \n \n `` Get on the floor!'' The stranger ordered with Timothy and Susan looking onwards. \n \n `` No! Please, do n't do this!'' Sam pleaded. \n \n The stranger put a pair of zip-ties around his wrists and his an ankles. He also put a strip of duct tape across Sam's mouth. `` Shut up, you have no right to talk. I've been fucking your wife for six months now. I ca n't believe you were stupid enough to think you were worth anything to her. Time to pay the price.'' \n \n The stranger shoved Sam into the kid's closet and shut the door. He heard footsteps head downstairs. He was sure that he was alone on the top floor. \n \n But Sam was no fool. Him and his coworkers had an odd initiation ritual for the new guys that came in. That was to tie them up in zip-ties and tell them to get out of it. It was rather easy, only took moving your wrists in the right direction. After all of these years, he had never told his wife about this, and now he was glad that he had poor communication with her. \n \n He easily got out of the wrist ties. The ankle ties took some time. Once he got them loose, he was able to pry out of them with his ankles. With everything off, including the duct tape, his feet quietly rushed towards his room. His phone was gone, but luckily his tracphone was still in his t-shirt drawer. He quickly turned it on and called 911. \n \n It was at that moment that he started to smell gas. They were going to light him on fire. \n \n He quickly explained the situation to the police and did his best to keep them up with what was going on. He ran to the ground level of the house to try and find his sawed off shotgun. \n \n It was gone. \n \n He quickly looked out the front window to see if his wife's new boyfriend's car was outside. It was. \n \n Suddenly, smoke started to show up outside. He had no idea what to do. He talked to the cops and they encouraged him to get to safety. \n \n He used the rarely used side door to escape. Neither his wife or her boyfriend saw him. He quickly ran over to John's house, a neighbor that he knew had a gun. With all of the fences and trees, it was easy to be discrete, even in a towel. \n \n John was waiting in his garage for him. `` Sam, get over here, the streets are shut down.'' \n \n `` What?'' Sam asked. \n \n `` I saw your wife out there about 20 minutes ago. She was banging on the door and threatened the kids to open the door for her. I did n't want to intervene, so I called the cops. I do n't think your wife and her guy know it yet, but the streets are already blocked in every direction. They're responding like there are hostages.'' \n \n `` Oh my gosh, thanks man! You're a life saver. I need to get my kids though!'' Sam responded. \n \n `` I'd say that the safest thing at this point is to sit tight. Let the cops do their job. Besides, they can make better shots than either of us could.'' John encouraged. He then continued to talk on his phone with the police. \n \n Sam and John were in tense conversations with each other over what their respective 911 responders were saying. It seemed like an hour, but it was only half a minute since Sam escaped his house. It was starting to rage in a blaze and that was when the car started moving with his wife and kids in it. He was getting too eager to not intervene. \n \n `` Hold yourself, Sam!'' John acknowledged. `` They've got it under control.'' \n \n John and Sam told the operator about the movement. After about 2 minutes, what seemed like 2 hours, the operator told them that the kids were safe and to expect an officer at their door soon. \n \n Sam was relieved. All of these years he spent complaining about how much he hated cops. But over the past couple of months, he was more than thankful for their service. \n \n His eyes were balling as he was quickly re-united with his kids again. \n \n Now it was time to figure out where to buy a new house. \n\n"}

The smell of him still clung to them. Every night, she wrapped herself in nostalgia. The sweet, musty smell of his neck had seeped into her pillow case. More potent than Ambien, she feared she'd never be able to sleep without it. In the dead of night, the aroma embraced her. Intoxicated by the last traces of her former husband, she hardly noticed her naked ring finger. Weeks ago he had come home while she was working. He took boxes of trinkets, suitcases of clothes, his coffee mug. But this he could not take from her. This was what he left. And this is what she needed. \n \n He tossed and turned in a stiff motel bed. He could never sleep in strange places, and without the sound of their ceiling fan, sleep would not come to him. He rummaged through boxes hastily placed in the corners of the room. His clothes lie around the floor, crumpled, tangled in themselves. In his sleep-deprived state, he could almost see the ghost of her, sighing as she folded his pants. She always tucked her hair behind her ear as she cleaned-the strands not quite long enough to stay put. He reached into the box, and felt for the cold metallic handle of her hairbrush. He had taken it from her drawer the day he left. He did n't know why. He had always loved the way her hair smelled. Strands of her auburn hair were still entwined in the bristles. Clutching the brush, he crept back into the unfamiliar bed. He held it tightly to his chest, and whispered her name as he finally fell asleep.\n"}

She had been delving deep into the clunky World Wide Web database to look at'blogs', fox.com, and Facebook. This was her first Krunkfest, but she felt prepared. \n \n As she entered the `` convention center'', as they called it, the first thing she noticed was that people of all digit lengths were walking around on one level plain. She had never mingled with 12 nor 14 digiteers, let alone 11s. Feeling both disgusted, yet privileged, she entered the masses.. Baffled at the banality of the music playing. A chalky voice blared, `` I came in like a wreecckiing balll..'', and despite the hollow, simple music, she found herself pacing her strides to the basic rhythm. \n \n 8174927493728 shuffled through the stalls, with everyone offering her'swag bags' full of useless items that used to be used. Forks and spoons made useless by enteric-sourced-nutrients. Small `` LED gloves'' that people used to wave in front of other's faces to entrance them in some unknown way. But her favorite was a small capsule of powder, different than her nutrient supplements, that she knew was contraband - since brain chemistry had been mastered and enforced by Them, there was no need for MDMA anymore. Every human existed in a constant state of perpetual near-satisfaction. It was well known that there used to be barbaric torture applied to chemically unstable people during this time. Later it was discovered, They told us, that it was the stress of managing one's own finance, relationships and other'personal problems' that caused the rampant suicides and schizophrenias. Obviously, once we surrendered these terrible stressors to Them, and mandated intracranial chemomonitors, people lived a very calm and near-content existence. Anyone's chemistry that was unable to be controlled was eliminated. \n \n A lifetime of intervention for her'imbalance' treatments is how she heard about Krunkfest.. A place for people to be free and mingle based on preference. There was something similar in that time, it was called Burning Man. In fact, it was'Karen Hartman's' Facebook photos that gave 8174927493728 the courage to come to Krunkfest. \n \n She swallowed the capsule of ancient chemicals and waited for the effects as she wandered between booths offering tastes of'alcohol', exhibits of'personal houses' ( versus the colonial digit dorms ), and hilarious outfits where people wore blue woven fabric'pants' and a different shirt daily... And still considered it a different outfit!! \n \n Somewhere in the throes of giggles at the absurdity of it all, she gradually began to feel something she had never felt before. Something. She realized, she had never felt ANYTHING before. She smiled ( considered a grotesque gesture at home ), and noticed others around her smiling. It was then that she realized, They were lying.

A Yuletide fable? I know just the one! The one I call the Carols of Carcosa. \u201d Hermans mother began his story with music, dancing and a King all in yellow, but too soon was Herman asleep, dreams took him under, in a gentle release. \n \n Herman awoke to early he realised it was still dark. \u201c It must be hours till morning \u201d, he thought to himself. So Herman ever so quiet picked up his coat, and he stole down the stairs quiet as a hare. Out through the door into the snow he went, he looked around checking for adults who might spoil his fun. But no one was there except an old snowman with a worn woolen hat and scarf so full of holes it was seemingly held together more with hope than thread. \n \n The snowman waved a branchy arm \u201c Hey Kid! \u201d he cried. Hermans short life had not prepared him for a talking snowman, so Herman did what came naturally; he ran away. Herman ran fast, the snowman seemingly nimble despite his ungainly frame, pursued close behind. Herman losing ground sought an edge, ducked into an alleyway then hopped a fence then another hoping to confuse his stalker and loose him amongst the neighbours \u2019 gardens. \n \n Herman stopped running, he could no longer hear the snowmans shouting. Perhaps he was safe, he took in his surroundings the building were strange here, he must have run further than he thought he realised. Worried now, Herman began to wander between the strange tall houses and narrow streets he now found himself within. As Herman wandered he caught snippets of music, of bells and of song. \u201c Carolers \u201d, thought Herman to himself, \u201c they \u2019 ll be able to see me home \u201d. Following the sounds as best he could soon the song began to clear. He caught glimpses of a melody eldrich to his ear of lyrics with gibbous meaning his mind reeled to peirce. Then a lantern he saw and three figures in a door, Herman took to move but was pulled to the floor; a fist made of snow began to cut of his air, his face did turn red as the song filled his ear, then darkness was all there was. \n \n Again Herman woke this time with a start, coughing cold water from his throat. He saw the snowman, sitting across from him looking through tarmac eyes. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s ok kid, just calm down. I never meant to startle you. It \u2019 s just you were running into bad news, thats all ok \u201d. the snowman stated in no uncertain terms. \n \n \u201c What is this place, who were those singers? \u201d Asked Herman \n \n \u201c Nasty pieces of work, but not half as bad as the witch.

Sure, he was only an intern but he was going to be surrounded by some of the greatest minds in the scientific world. \n \n \n The first day at the office had been quiet. People were just sitting at their respective desks, doing their respective research and studies. They were busy enough that they did n't care to ask about Larry or where he came from. \n \n \n Today, however, the day was a little bit more chaotic. The office sounded like a beehive, people walking from one side of the office to the next, it was pure madness. Seemed more like Wall Street than it did Dallas. \n \n \n `` Everyone, calm down!'' shouted one of the scientists. His name was Dr. Pancel and he was one of the youngest ones amongst the scientists in the lab. Everyone stopped talking and looked over to Dr. Pancel. They all sat down as they listened to him. `` Do we have any ideas yet as to why these newspapers have obviously fake headlines?'' \n \n \n `` But I remember that headline, it is n't fake!'' the only lady in the room shouted. \n \n \n `` No, he was murdered right here in Dallas in 1963,'' Dr. Pancel responded. \n \n \n `` The shooter missed, just like the newspaper says,'' the lady added. \n \n \n `` Anyone has any theories?'' Dr. Pancel asked again ignoring Dr. Morgan's potential craziness. This was very much unlike her. \n \n \n `` They are probably photoshopped,'' Dr. Johnson said. `` They look almost fake to me. What in the world is the Dallas Hourly anyway?'' he added, referring to one of the newspaper's found. \n \n \n `` It is the most famous, prestigious newspaper in Dallas. What the heck is wrong with you people?'' Dr. Morgan replied, now very clearly annoyed with the situation. Everyone reacted to this and they stood up from their chairs and started screaming at each other. \n \n \n Larry took this opportunity to step outside the office and send a message from his watch. He whispered into it and said `` merger of timeline twenty-four into timeline one successful. Two more mergers to go and John F. Kennedy will finally be dead.'' \n\n"}

My hands trembled as they held up the thermal camera. `` What is that?'' I whispered. Through the camera lens, I could see my family sitting in the den: five red-and-orange distinctive human shapes. But beneath them, through the ground, I saw a *sixth* shape. At first glance, it looked like a human in the fetal position. But there was something very off about its head. I increased the resolution on the camera, and saw what appeared like... *antennas* sticking out of the head. \n \n I looked back up and saw that two of my family members were walking toward the front door.

I crept back up the stairs, out of the basement, and down the hall toward the front door. Once outside, I ran to my car to grab my camera. I opened it up and aimed it back into the basement.

My mom called. `` What are you doing?'' \n \n I ignored her. My heart raced as I got closer to the basement. I could see the creature more clearly, now. It was definitely not human, or any animal I had ever seen. I threw open the basement door and ran down the stairs. \n \n Through my camera lens, I could see it huddled over in the corner. But when I removed the camera from my face, it disappeared. *What the hell? * \n \n I put the camera back up to my face and walked toward the creature.

One of the previous jurors left a small inscription under the ledge of the table in front of your seat . You 're shocked to see what it says .\n","story":"Reggie Jenkins was one of the rare breed of folks that looked forward to jury duty. He'd always liked all those lawyer and cop procedural shows, so the idea of doing his civic duty really seemed like rather a lot of fun. And now that he was retired, it was n't even an inconvenience to serve. \n \n So when he'd gotten the summons in the mail a month before, he'd dutifully circled the day on his calendar, and made sure to have his best suit cleaned and pressed for the day. Though he was tempted to check the newspapers to see what kind of cases were going on, Reggie kept to his usual diet of TV reruns and detective novels, lest he read something that could prejudice him about anything. \n \n The day finally came. Reggie made sure he was the first one to arrive at the jury call room, and settled in for the long wait before the jury pool would be called up to a courtroom. He'd brought a book with him, a biography of a Ulysses S. Grant. It was exactly the kind of thing he knew the lawyers would be looking for: proof that he was smart, but nothing that made it seem like he would favor one side over the other. \n \n Three hours later, he and the rest of the potential jurors were marched up to Courtroom 207, for what turned out to be the trial Reggie had been waiting his whole life for. \n \n `` Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,'' the judge said. `` Ordinarily, I begin with a speech about the importance of jury duty to our society and the heavy responsibility born by each and every one of you. That importance though will be evident from the next words to leave my mouth: on trial is David Culley, accused of murdering Mary Jo Kappernick.'' \n \n A small titter of recognition worked its way across the room, but the name meant nothing to Reggie. He kept right on smiling, pleased to have the opportunity to serve. \n \n Reggie learned from the questions asked by the lawyers that this was a murder that received a great deal of media coverage. Young college co-ed suddenly disappeared, only to be found a couple of weeks later, apparently tortured to death. What got even more publicity, though, had been the mistrial just a couple of months ago. The lawyers seemed to be especially interested in whether anyone had read or heard anything about the previous mistrial. \n \n Their questions succeeded in weeding out a great number of jurors, and before long, Reggie found himself sitting in the juror box, being questioned by both lawyers. \n \n `` Good morning Mr. Jenkins, thank you for coming in this morning. I see from your paperwork that you are retired,'' the prosecutor asked. `` Is that correct?'' \n \n `` Yes, sir, I am,'' Reggie answered. \n \n `` And what did you do before that?'' \n \n `` I was a janitor for Lincoln Elementary for 43 years.'' \n \n `` That's quite impressive. I suspect you may have cleaned up a mess or two of mine,'' the prosecutor said with a forced laugh. \n \n Reggie just smiled and nodded. \n \n `` So, Mr. Jenkins, you've heard all of the other questions asked here before. Have you read any of the news accounts regarding the death of Ms. Kappernick?'' \n \n `` No, sir, I have n't.'' \n \n The prosecutor furrowed his brow. `` None?'' he asked skeptically. \n \n `` No, sir, not a lick. I do n't read the newspaper.'' \n \n `` How do you get your news then?'' \n \n `` Word of mouth these days. Now that I've retired, that's tapered off a bit, but to tell you the truth, I do n't miss it. Just about everything the media reports on is depressing, and not much of it matters to your everyday life, you know what I mean?'' \n \n `` Well, Mr. Jenkins,'' the prosecutor said, `` I ca n't really find fault with your reasoning. So how do you spend your free time?'' \n \n `` Reading. Watching the idiot box more than I should.'' \n \n `` Alright then, Mr. Jenkins, just one last question: any reason you ca n't be fair and impartial in this case?'' \n \n `` No sir, I ca n't think of any reason.'' \n \n `` Thank you Mr. Jenkins. Your honor, the State passes this juror for cause.'' \n \n The defense lawyer rose next and asked similar questions. Reggie managed to answer them all to the lawyer's satisfaction, because he also passed him for cause. The questioning of the rest of the jurors continued on all morning, but right before lunch, the jury selection process was completed. Much to Reggie's pleasure, he was juror number six. \n \n They were dismissed for lunch, with strict instructions not to discuss the case with anyone. Reggie picked up a sandwich from a food cart, and spent lunch in a park across the street from the courthouse, all the while marveling at his good luck. His whole life he had dreamed of serving on a jury, and now it was finally happening. In a murder case, of all things! Truly he must have done something right in a prior life. \n \n Reggie reported back ten minutes before they were due back to return, and waited patiently to be taken up to the jury room. When the rest of the jurors arrived back from lunch, a clerk escorted them all back upstairs, and led them to the small room where they would eventually do their deliberations. \n \n Reggie settled into his seat as everyone started making introductions. As an old habit, he ran his fingers along the underside of the table, checking for chewed gum. Instead, he found a small, folded up piece of paper. He unfolded it in his lap, and read it. \n \n `` David Culley confessed to killing Mary Jo, but the judge threw it out. Convict him.'' \n \n Reggie stared at the words a while, until the clerk came and brought them back into the courtroom. His mind was racing as he walked toward the courtroom. This note tainted the jury. It had to be reported. How could the clerk be so careless as to leave something like this behind from the mistrial? \n \n The jurors filed back into the courtroom, and took their assigned seats. They all rose as the judge came into the courtroom. \n \n `` I hope you all had a pleasant lunch. We'll get started with opening statements, but before we do, given what happened in the last trial, I just want a confirmation from our jurors that nothing happened during lunch that would affect your impartiality. None of you did any searches on your cell phones about the case or discussed it with any one?'' \n \n The jurors shook their heads no. Reggie slowly raised his hand. \n \n `` Mr. Jenkins?'' the judge asked, his eyebrows rising high on his forehead. \n \n `` I'm sorry Your Honor, but before we get too far along, may I use the restroom?'' \n \n The judge let out a small laugh. `` You frightened me there, Mr. Jenkins. Yes, why do n't you go on ahead and get it out of the way now. The bailiff will take you down.'' \n \n The clerk escorted Reggie back to the bathroom connected to the jury deliberation room. Reggie stepped inside and tore up the piece of paper. He dropped the pieces in, and flushed them. \n \n This had been a dream for too long.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The mountains are waiting .\n","story":"Like eternal sentinels, the mountains stood watching over the lands as long as the elders can remember. Dozens of tales, poems, and works of art have been made based around these mountains. Our entire culture has stemmed from the great roots of these granite citadels. The mountains are our greatest protector, our gods, and yet somehow our greatest enemy. \n \n We do not know what lies beyond the mountains. Fantastic lights appear from behind the great stone guardians, illuminating the cool summer nights when we sleep. And yet, the mountains only watch. They face whatever makes these lights, and turn their gaze upon it as they do to us in the day. Our elders and ancient stories say it is an army of demons, using minerals from the earth to create strange, chemical devices to attempt to break down our gods. Yet the mountains lie still, only watching, only waiting. No one is sure what they are waiting for - the end of the world, the greatest assault from the demon army, or the slow, decrepit touch of time to fall upon their impenetrable flesh. All that we know is they will protect us from whatever horrors lie beyond their weary, eternal faces. \n \n *This is my first post here, so hopefully it's not terrible. *\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You hear a politician rehearsing a speech . That 's normal . What is n't normal is the politician rehearsing being assassinated in the middle of it .\n","story":"\u201c And as we move forward with this administration, I believe that every one of you will \u2026 \u201d Senator Willis rattled off, practicing his upcoming speech in an empty board room inside his senate offices. \u201c \u2026 looking forward to \u2014 \u201c \n \n \u201c BANG! \u201d Senator Willis yelled out. \n \n The senator staggered backwards in the boardroom, yelling out. \u201c Oh no! Oh no! The crowd goes wild. Blood spurting everywhere. \u201d The senator narrated as he squished ketchup packets onto his chest. He \u2019 d gotten the packets from a nearby Denny's. \n \n Willis practiced falling onto his back, and letting out one last death spasm before falling silent. The boardroom was still for a moment as Willis lay there, before the senator stood up and dusted off his suit. The man turned to his public relations specials, Jim Jonry. Stains of red ketchup covered the senator as he spoke. \n \n \u201c I just don \u2019 t know Jim. Do you really think this will work? \u201d \n \n Jonry looked up from his cellphone. He \u2019 d just finished the final touches on Senator Willis \u2019 s next, and probably most memorable, press conference to date. \n \n \u201c Of course it will Willis, you \u2019 re talking to the king of spin over here. There isn \u2019 t a story I can \u2019 t flip on its head, an ugly duckling that I can \u2019 t turn into a beautiful swan. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, yeah I know that. But do you really think that getting assassinated will make the media forget about my infidelities and that whole giving one of my mistresses state secrets case? \u201d Willis asked. \n \n \u201c No, no, that \u2019 s not it! If you just got assassinated, no one would forget anything. What you \u2019 re going to do is *pretend* to be assassinated. When the public finds out that you \u2019 re still alive after faking your death, they \u2019 ll blow up. Everyone will forget about your dozens of mistress once they \u2019 re busy going nuts over your failed attempt at faking your own death. It \u2019 s genius really! \u201d Jim exclaimed in excitement. He \u2019 d thought of the idea one late night after watching the Bourne trilogy and consuming a heavy quantity of liquor. \n \n \u201c Well, alright then. \u201d The senator replied, walking over to a corner cabinet and pouring himself a stiff drink of scotch. \u201c As long as I get elected next term, I don \u2019 t care what happens. I \u2019 ve got a sweet deal with big oil coming up. All I have to do is pollute the local water supply, and get rid of a pesky national park, and I \u2019 ve got a fancy new mansion waiting for me to inhabit it. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes yes, that \u2019 s all well and good. \u201d Jim replied, only half listening. It seemed that every couple of months the senator had some new bribe to trick the public into supporting corrupt business. The senator had been in power for over a decade now, and only recently had wind of his scandals and corrupt dealings caught media attention. \n \n \u201c Do you think this will improve my chances with evangelicals? I mean they aren \u2019 t a big fan of infidelity, do you really think that this will make them forget about all of that? \u201d Willis asked between sips of scotch. \n \n Jim shrugged his shoulders in reply. \u201c I can \u2019 t predict the future, who knows what \u2019 ll happen. Hell, if we wait three days after the assassination to reveal that you \u2019 re still alive, maybe they \u2019 ll think you \u2019 re the second coming. \u201d \n \n \u201c Hmmm. \u201d Willis replied, nodding his head in thought. \u201c That would definitely help my numbers in the polls. Nothing like religious fervor to get people fired up. \u201d \n \n Jim turned off his phone and looked up at the senator. \u201c Now Willis, I \u2019 ve got a serious question to ask you. \u201d \n \n The senator sat down at the meeting table across from Jim Jonry. \u201c What \u2019 s up? \u201d \n \n \u201c I heard a rumor the other day that you \u2019 ve kind of \u2026 er \u2026 that you \u2019 ve gotten into the occult lately. \u201d Jim said, motioning his hands through the air. It was a delicate subject, and he didn \u2019 t want to put the senator off. \n \n \u201c Oh you heard about that? \u201d Willis asked excitedly. He put down his drink of scotch. \u201c Yeah I \u2019 ve really gotten into the whole black magic and devil worship stuff recently. A few months ago, one of my doctors was telling me about how his dad used to study that kind of stuff back during World War II. \u201d \n \n \u201c So, you are doing \u2026 *that* kind of stuff. That \u2019 s fine, that \u2019 s fine, but the media won \u2019 t like it if they find out. Maybe it \u2019 d be safer to stick to the normal stuff, like cocaine and prostitutes. \u201d Jim replied. \n \n \u201c No way man, the devils awesome. I \u2019 ve really gotten into him and his work. Or her, the whole gender thing is kind of ambiguous sometimes. That \u2019 s super twenty first century stuff; I bet the millennials would love that. \u201d Willis said in an animated voice. He stared to remove his necktie and unbutton his shirt. His suit jacket lay disheveled on the ground. \n \n \u201c But maybe this is just a phase? You know, that kind of stuff happens to everybody. \u201d Jim replied, hoping that the senator was just joking with him. Jim was worried, worshipping the devil was probably the only absolute no-no in politics in this day and age. Hell, they were even letting the gays into office nowadays. \n \n \u201c Definitely not a phase, I \u2019 m into this one hundred and ten percent. All the way baby. Here check this out. \u201d The senator said. \n \n To Jim \u2019 s amazement, Senator Willis took off his dress shirt. With a proud look, he displayed his bare chest to the PR specialist in front of him. Tattooed across his chest and belly was a large, black pentagram. In the foreground of the tattoo, a depiction of the devil was dancing, a flute held in his clawed hands. \n \n \u201c You can \u2019 t be serious? \u201d Jim asked, his mouth agape. \n \n \u201c I most certainly am. You \u2019 d be surprised; there are a bunch of satan worshippers up at capital hill. Heck, I even think I saw a cardinal at one of our last meet-ups. Really nice guy; can draw one mean pentagram I tell you what. \u201d \n \n \u201c Jesus H. Christ you can \u2019 t be serious! \u201d Jim yelled, jumping out of his chair. \n \n \u201c Hey, no swearing now! \u201d The senator scolded. \u201c This is definitely serious, and if you don \u2019 t like it, well you can just march right our of here this minute then. \u201d \n \n \u201c I will. I mean Christ! Satan worshipping. I could handle the booze and mistresses, the drugs and illegal bribes, but this? There \u2019 s no way I can spin this if the public gets ahold of it. \u201d Jim said, storming out of the room. The door slammed shut behind him \n \n Senator Willis stared at the door, and muttered to himself. \u201c Screw that, I don \u2019 t need you. I know a guy who \u2019 d be more than happy to represent me. \u201d \n \n The senator pulled out his phone and sent off a quick text message. A few moments later, a flash of smoke and fire filled the room. From the smoke, the demon Beelzebub appeared. The demon draped an arm of angry red flesh around the senator. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t worry big fella, you don \u2019 t need that guy. Now about that press conference. I \u2019 ve got a few ideas for you \u2026 \u201d Beelzebub said, getting down to business with his newest client. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Hope you liked it. Also, this was kind of a politically charged post, but I'm not trying to push any agendas out there in any way, or even believe any of the stuff in this post ( I wanted to tack this warning on because I always get scared of posting anything politically related on reddit, but I had to post this time, the idea of a politician rehearsing being assassinated was too much of a fun idea for me not to write ).

There were people dressed in very nice suits and dresses, most likely people from his church group. There were people dressed in jeans and a button ups. Co-workers from the freight yard I thought. There was a man in heavily decorated Navy uniform sitting in the back with a cold hard stare that could rival my dads. \n \n I shifted my weight uncomfortably and cleared my throat and stared at my note cards that I had prepared. I had never spoken at a funeral before. `` Hello,'' I said sheepishly into the mike. is hello something you say to people in a situation like this? `` I suppose I do n't need to tell you much about Steve.'' I joked `` He was kind of a man who did n't need an introduction.'' The crowed giggled and I began to sweat. I glanced at my cards but the words I had written seemed to make no sense. `` My father was... a difficult man to get to know, but those who were close to know have probably never met a more confident, loyal, hard working man in their lives.'' At this moment I turned the cards face down, not sure how I could make such polished and distant words apply. `` If he was called to work, or someone from his church needed him. he was always there for them.'' I saw some people in the audience nod and smile. \n \n `` Steve was very determined, and once he started something, he would not stop until it was done. And he did his best to teach that to me. He was dedicated to his faith, and his family. A proud ex Marine who got to see much of the world in his youth and had a passion for Jazz music as most of you might have known for watching him in the church band. He was a man who knew exactly who he was and where he was going in life. and we will miss him very much.'' My speech was painfully short, I hoped that they could chalk it up to me being too emotional. \n \n As I took my seat next to the vacant ones that were reserved for my brother and mother I began to think about how I wished I could tell them how he never had time for me. How I was persona non grata until I was old enough to work and date, and then he had an opinion on everything I did. I was too lazy, too stubborn, I acted like an ungrateful child and would never make it on my own. I wanted to tell them all how he drove me to run away from home at 16, and how his last words to me were that is he could do it all over again, he would never have me for a daughter. I studied my brothers chair and tried to imagine him there. I assumed he was too drunk to bother to show up..but I think maybe he had the right idea. \n \n The woman who took the stage after me introduced herself and a long time friend of my fathers, stating that she had known my dad since I was only a baby. `` Steve was not without fault,'' She smiled at me `` While he was a good friend, He could also say some things to get under your skin. But that's a good thing, because he told us things we did n't want to hear, but sometimes needed to. He did the best he could, with what he had. Even if it was not what we had in mind, he tried. He showed so many of us how to keep going, showing us that stopping now was impossible. He was a rock and a leader for those who needed him.'' She looked over at the picture of him propped up next to the ashes on a table. `` He was never on time, He cursed ever other word, and seemed down right rude to some of us.'' I froze, unable to breath. `` But we miss him anyway, and I know with all my heart that he loved each and everyone of us, he just did n't know how to show it.''

The same hero is constantly caught in the cycle of leaving for an adventure , having their adventure , settling down , and being forced to leave again .\n","story":"The word spread like wildfire. `` Hrunthgar has returned!'' Children skipped on the dirt streets, chanting `` Hrunthgar saw the Dragon's Head! Punched it once and now it's dead.'' The innkeepers readied their best ales. The beekeepers readied their best honey. The whore keepers readied their best whores. The bonfires were lit, the benches dragged to the streets, and the fiddlers were summoned from their sleep. \n \n Amidst all of this Hruthgar did return. He was a man and a half, face chiseled from stone. On his back was an axe of improbable size. In each hand was a sack that clinked with the sound that comes only from coins of the purest gold. \n \n The first voice rang out over the din \u201c It is him! \u201d And then silence, only broken by the echoes of the words and the sweet golden clink. The crowd stepped back, opening a path to the bonfire. In front of Hrunthgar was a woman of surpassing beauty, skin fair in a brown land. Juliet, the greatest trophy he had ever taken. Flanking her were four boys, each a marvel of childhood. \n \n Hrunthgar walked forward, until his vision was filled with this woman, backlit by the fire, a goddess from parts barely remembered. And then he broke the silence. \n \n \u201c Too long I have been away. I have drank the piss wine of foreign lands. I killed trolls, goblins, and gods. And now I have returned home. To the land which birthed me. \u201d \n \n He threw one of the bags over his shoulder, as if it weighed nothing at all. It hit the ground behind him and the air filled with expectation. \n \n \u201c This is for you. All of you. Bring me the Fire Wine of our people. Bring me a cow on a spit. Let me see my boys. \u201d \n \n He reached out one giant arm and pulled in his wife, leaned to her ear, and whispered in a voice that carried across the town square. \u201c And tonight I will remind you what is to be a hero \u2019 s woman. \u201d \n \n The town cheered. Tankards went up. Tankards went down. And the town celebrated until dawn. \n \n It was some time after dawn that Hrunthgar felt the sunlight try to burn its way into his brain. The Fire Wine had left his head feeling not unlike a camel \u2019 s ass, and the taste it left in his mouth seemed to match. He resolved to spend the rest of the day in his feather bed when he felt movement. He turned over, and felt his blood run cold. He jumped out of bed and scrambled for his axe. \n \n \u201c Foul Beast! \u201d He yelled. \u201c What have you done with my fair girl Juliet! \u201d \n \n The pile of matted hair on the bed shifted, then blinked. From there it was a short walk to irritated. \n \u201c Put the axe down, you ass. No one looks good in the morning. And I \u2019 m not a girl anymore. I've carried 4 of your spawn.'' She sniffed and ran her hand along her stomach. `` And all your babies are giants. Hell. I have n't even washed yet.'' \n \n She stood up and grumbled something about a comb, then headed out to the well. \n \n Hrunthgar carefully laid down his axe and tied on his loin cloth. \u201c Truly, she bears the visage of a demon. \u201d He whispered, quiet as he could. \n \n There was a rumble, one that started deep, then rose to fill his ears. He braced himself against the wall, waiting for the elephants.The door of the room burst open, and the four boys charged in. Hrunthgar, whose reflexes let him catch an arrow out of the air, did not properly align his hips in time, resulting in an unfortunate headbutt from the youngest as the boy ran to embrace him. As he sank to the ground, pain welling from his center, Hrunthgar forced a smile. \n \n \u201c Boys. \u201d He said, his voice unnaturally high, \u201c How I \u2019 ve missed you. \u201d \n \n Breakfast brought with it no relief. Hrunthgar \u2019 s lady had declined to perform her breakfast duties after the morning discussion, so he was forced to eat cold marrow from the remnants of last night \u2019 s cow. \n \n The boys fought. Constantly. With each other, shifting alliances and backstabbing more than a dozen bearded viziers. But now, with Hrunthgar here, they all came and tried to enlist him in their battles, with voices whiny and wheedling. The day dragged, and then was gone. \n \n When dinner finished be brought his new bag of gold to the family chest. When he opened it red filled his eyes, and he shouted. \u201c Juliet! To me. \u201d \n \n Juliet arrived, after what seemed to his mind far too long a time to walk such a piddling distance. \u201c What is it? \u201d She said. \n \n \u201c When I left you this chest was filed to the brim with gold. It was a king's ransom \u201d he said. \n \n She sighed. \u201c You exaggerate. \u201d \n \n \u201c I do not. It literally ransomed a king. \u201d \n \n \u201c Children are expensive Hrunthgar. Every single one of them eats like his father. And do you know how much we spend on hero training? A gold piece every week! The carpenter only wants a copper piece! How many efreets are even out there to kill? The world needs more benches. We aren \u2019 t running out of asses any time soon. \u201d \n \n Hrunthgar, famed for his bravery, choose this time to embrace discretion. He poured the bag of coins until it filled the top of the chest, then carefully closed it. Besides, Juliet had worked woman \u2019 s magic and was beautiful again. \n \n He reached for her and pulled her close. He felt her hand on his chest. Then he felt her hand push him away. Juliet \u2019 s eyes flashed fire. \n \n `` Tonight you will watch these children. You will not complain. I have spent a brace of fortnights feeding and caring for the whelps. Tonight I go with my women and we will drink like we drank before we were so afflicted.'' \n \n Hrunthgar sat back, where a bench might be had his children been carpenters.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` Who let these guys in the tournament ? They are awful ! ''\n","story":"When attempting to lose someone the best place to hide is within a crowd, blending in with the other people going about their day. So of course when Thomas saw the crowd of people forming down a side street he did n't think twice about joining them and being led away, far from the murderous glare of the man whose wife he had just slept with ( In his defence she did say she was single... ). \n \n Heading down into what appeared to be the basement of a pub he could hear the sound of shouting from further ahead. As he rounded the corner he saw a man, bloodied and bruised, get thrown back into a ring of people where another man, slightly less beaten, was ready with a straight jab that sent the man down for the count. \n \n `` And we have our first winner of our elimination open ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Mr. Steven Lyons'' \n \n A cheer went up from the ring of onlookers, the victor in the centre having his hand hoisted in the air by a short man who had apparently just been speaking. \n \n Thomas was n't sure what he had stumbled in on but frankly he did n't want anything else to do with it. He barely had turned and put a foot forward before someone had grabbed his shoulder. Looking up he could see a man much bulkier than himself, clean shaven with scruffy black hair, and a wide grin that stood out more due to the fact that one of his front teeth was missing. \n \n `` Hey Chris, it looks like we've got a quitter over here!'' The large man exclaimed to the rest of the room. \n \n At this point the rest of the room's attention was now on Thomas, who squirmed ever so slightly at the amount of people staring. The small, and may it be said, slightly rotund man MCing for the evening gained a devilish smirk on his small pudgy face. \n \n `` That's not a quitter you've got there, that's our next fighter.'' The small bellowed across the room. As if on queue the room took great delight in manhandling their next contestant until he was smack dab in the middle of them. \n \n He looked around fearfully, he did n't want to fight anyone here, not so much because he was against fighting but more the fact that most of them looked like they would squash him, literally. \n \n His fears were interrupted however when more noise erupted from near the doorway and another man was thrust into the centre of the ring. It seems he was n't the only one who had decided they'd seen enough and wanted out early. \n \n `` Ladies and Gentleman, it seems for our second match we have two men who do n't fully understand how the rules work here, here you do n't get too leave until either the event is over, or you've won a match. Want to leave early? Win your freedom here and now. Hell we've even gone easy on you both.'' By the end the small man was laughing to himself, though was quickly joined by the gathering crowd, interested to see what would happen when you put the equivalents of a rabbit against a mouse. \n \n Looking at his opponent Thomas could see why he had wanted to leave early, a small frame and a fearful look in his eyes it was clear that much like himself he'd wandered in here unaware of the purpose of this establishment. Now Thomas was n't much better to be fair, slightly stockier due to the manual labour his part time job required he should stand a better chance. \n \n The only problem was, Thomas had never thrown a punch before. \n \n Hell he'd never even attempted to, violence was n't something that he was accustomed to, any problems he'd had in the past was sorted out through words like civilised folk. \n \n `` No time like the present. Fight!'' The small man shouted as he backed into the crowd. \n \n Thomas looked up from where he'd disappeared ready to move at the slightest of movement, only to see his opponent do the same. They stared at each other waiting for the other to move. At the boos and jeers of the crowd they started to move, slowly circling round each other, neither of them holding up a guard or a fist ready to strike, just... watching. \n \n The jeers from the crowd got louder as they soon realised that neither men would actually throw the first punch. Cries of'Sissies!','Do something!', and'Punch him!' rang from the circle, one man could be noted turning to the organiser Chris and remarking with some mirth in his voice'Who let these guys in the tournament? They're awful'. \n \n Eventually one particularly impatient gentleman decided to speed things along, and with an almighty shove Thomas was thrust forward at his opponent. \n \n Now what he lacked in size, the timid man apparently made up in speed, as he hastily dodged to the side of Thomas' impromptu charge. \n \n Regaining his bearings, Thomas decided to push his advantage and take a wild swing at his spooked opponent, however it was not quite wild enough and it was once again backed away from. \n \n Over extended and off balance as he was it was the perfect chance for Thomas' opponent to counter attack with a flurry of punches. Weak and sloppy punches mind, as Thomas realised when one connected with his jaw. Still from never being hit before the shock of getting punched in the face seemed to be a wake up call for Thomas. \n \n As the next punch came in Thomas stepped aside and grabbed the offending limb, pulling it forward and sending his opponent sprawling onto the floor. This elected a cheer from the crowd as some action was finally happening. Scrambling to his feet the mousey man turned ready to face Thomas once more, yet again without a guard. This came to be his final error as Thomas landed a clean shot to the man's nose, breaking it and causing blood to start trickling down, as he collapsed lifeless to the floor. \n \n As suddenly as he had disappeared the small man from earlier reappeared grabbing Thomas' hand and raising it in the air. \n \n `` Well, he may have started off weak but came out with a strong finish, give it up for...'' The small man dragged Thomas closer to whisper in his ear `` What's your name kid?'' \n \n `` uhh, Thomas'' was the shaky reply, still unsure of what he'd actually done to the smaller man lying prone on the floor. \n \n `` Give it up for Thomas everyone!'' The announcer shouted as the crowd began to holler and cheer. \n \n Thomas did n't really think as he walked away from the crowd of people, away from the man who still was unmoving on the floor of the ring of people, up the stairs and out into the fresh air. Once outside however, he looked back at the entranceway of the place he just left, he looked down at the blood that had splattered onto his crinkled white shirt, and he ran. He ran as far from there as he could, wishing never to see that place again.\n"}

Vinnie connected his fist with my left eye. It hurt, but only a little more than last time I had gotten punched there. Why are punches the always first resort? They'd probably get more mileage pulling molars or pouring acid on my my face. \n \n `` Vince and Vinnie. Is this a joke? Am I on the set of some shitty Italian mobster movie?'' I quipped.

The key to immortality was far more important than his vision. \n \n `` I do n't have any Reasons. I have n't prayed for over 400 years. I wake up every afternoon at half past two so I miss morning prayer. That's my secret!'' \n \n And then Vinnie punched me again, in the right eye this time. \n \n `` This was a waste of time. Let's just leave him here,'' Vince told Vinnie. \n \n I laughed. `` I did n't want to have to do this, but here we go.'' \n \n This was a rare occasion. If I did n't call on Death himself, I would actually just be trapped in this cave forever. \n \n `` Death!'' I screamed. `` Come down here right now or I'll off myself right now! I swear I'll do it!'' \n \n `` The fuck are you doing?'' Vince asked impatiently. \n \n `` Death! I know you're listening you asshole, come down here or I'll bite my tongue off and just die right here!'' \n \n There was a deafening snapping sound and blinding light. The next thing we saw was a pale skinned figure with wet brown hair, donning a white robe and flip flops. The word `` Death'' was emblazoned in gold on the left chest pocket of his robe. What a narcissist. \n \n `` Jesus Christ, Dave, what do you want?'' the figure asked. \n \n `` Well I'm kind of trapped here, could you let me out?'' \n \n Death snapped and the ropes fell loose. `` You interrupted my shower for this? Damn it, Dave, this is why I sent you back, you annoying piece of shit.'' \n \n Death turned to Vince and Vinnie. `` What are you two looking at?'' \n \n After a moment of shock, Vince responded. `` Why the hell does Dave get special treatment? Every morning we pray to you not to kill us, because no one will feed our wives and kids. Some days we do n't even feel like living anymore, but who's gon na take care of the family? Yet, Dave does n't even go to morning prayer and you come to save him?'' \n \n Death laughed dryly, `` Dave died a long time ago. He's the only one I ever sent back to the land of the living. A mere hour of being with him and I wanted to Kurt Cobain myself. But I ca n't, because I'm the motherfucking god of death.'' \n \n `` If you're a god, why did n't you just send him away? To the depths of the underworld? All-powerful my ass.'' Vince asked. \n \n `` Why? Because my fucking niece fell in love with him! It was a match made in hell. And the wedding, oh man, do n't even get me started on the wedding! You know, my sister's still mad for sending Dave back, even after 400 fucking years!'' \n \n Death was oozing with frustration just remembering about our wedding, and I was relishing in it. \n \n Finally, Vince had enough and burst out in fury. `` You know, I do n't know why we pray to you. You're not a god! You're just some fat fuck in a robe!

After WWI the world vowed not to start war, which was ignored by Imperial Japan, who decided to bomb Pearl Harbour and start a massive war in the Pacific, ended by two final booms of atomic bombs. However, immediately a `` Cold War'' between the USSR and the US began to start, culminating in the fall of the USSR in the early 2000s.

The culture of the nation was amazing, as shown by the studio\/office I was standing in front of. I cautiously walked inside, to see a massive eagle and swastika in the central lobby. The founder of this company, Adolf Hitler, said that this was a sign of peace and that someday Germany will rule the world. Continuing up the stairs to the business meeting I was asked to attend, I spotted more swastikas and eagles. Finally, reaching the boardroom, I opened the door, interrupting, what I would describe best as a cult meeting, with people in strange German uniforms gathering around a candle sitting on a book.

Evictions are beginning in your hometown for unpaid rent .\n","story":"Last week, Grandma came back to live with us. I use the term `` live'' loosely; Grandma has been dead since I was fourteen. Being of modest economic standing, my family could n't exactly afford to keep her where she's been peacefully sleeping for the last eight years and seeing as she is no longer a *functioning* member of society per se, she's lost her precious resting place. The city delivered the eviction notice two days before she was to be exhumed. My brother and I helped my father clear a spot out in the corner of the basement - for temporary storage, of course - until we can either find a cheaper hole in the ground or bring ourselves to cremate her. \n \n The first cemetery to start charging its dead rent was the Mt. Olivet cemetery in Detroit. It was a controversial attempt at pulling the city out its financial sinkhole. The policy wound up spreading like wildfire first through the remaining U.S. states, then throughout the Western world, and eventually to the rest of the world once the economic benefits became evident. As it turns out, no one wants their loved ones to come back to live with them. The dead are often not the most pleasant of company. \n \n Take Trish - she was the first of my friends to have a loved one get nixed from their resting place. Her dad raised hell as soon as he got back home. I suppose it could n't have been entirely too peaceful to sleep in the basement of your old home while your widow slept upstairs with your brother. Trish stayed with me until her mother and step dad found Daddy Dearest a new eternal home. \n \n Grandma was quiet her first night or two. Her bones are old and tired, no one expected she would bother with your typical disturbed spirit routine; not to mention we were never anything but kind to her in life. Especially me - I was her favorite grandchild, after all. That may explain why she came after me first. \n \n Night three or four of Grandma's return home - time is hard to keep track of now - I awoke to the sound of the basement door creaking open. The cats' litter boxes are in the basement and we always left the door propped open, so the sound was no surprise. No, the surprise came when I heard my grandmother's voice floating through my thin bedroom door. \n \n `` Kay, dearest,'' she said in a soft voice. It filled my ears and sent a chill down my spine. \n \n `` I've missed you so, dearie. I'm so glad you decided to bring me home.'' The dead had n't caught on to the fact that it's not necessarily a choice when we bring them home. My doorknob began to rattle and twist as Grandma opened the door. I sat up in bed, holding the covers close around my neck and backing as far as I could into my headboard. \n \n `` Hello, Grandma,'' I said, voice shaking in the sudden cold in my room. A faint shape crossed my bedroom and came to rest at the foot of my bed. I stared at it, and it at me for several frozen moments. I felt a hand come to rest on my leg, outside of the covers. I could smell her perfume, a pleasant gardenia musk, the same one she always wore in life. \n \n `` It is so nice to see you. You are as beautiful as I remember.'' \n \n `` Thank you, Grandma,'' I blushed. *This is n't so bad. * \n \n `` How I wish I could still be a part of your life.'' \n \n `` You still can, Grandma,'' I said, reaching out to touch her hand, but there was no hand to touch. I blacked out. \n \n That was a day or two ago, maybe ages now. Eons. I do n't quite remember what followed, but I awoke the next morning in the basement, thinking I'd sleep walked.

You either do as I command or you go to a concentration camp. Your choice, Mr. Clause. \u201d \n \n The ancient, generous man fought with his thoughts. If he accepted Kim \u2019 s commands, then he would give the man on the top of his Naughty List exactly what he wanted; however, if he refused Kim \u2019 s commands, he would disappoint every good little boy and girl across the world. Finally, Santa sighed, making his decision. \n \n \u201c Fine, Kim, \u201d the bearded figure spoke in a downtrodden voice, \u201c You win. After my route tonight, I will return to North Korea and give you all the cookies I collect from the world. \u201d \n \n \u201c I knew you would make the right decision! \u201d the dictator yelled as he jumped in glee like a small child. \u201c I think I shall celebrate this victory with a bubble bath. Release him. \u201d \n \n Santa slowly left the sad, little country, dragging his boots a little. The man just gave up the only luxury and token of thanks he received all year to a mad man with a sweet tooth for the children, but at least, he thought, the children were worth every bit.\n"}

Today is our first real confirmation that we're not alone in the universe, and the first thing we have to do is fight a war...'' Her voice trailed off and her eyes became unfocused. `` I suppose that's about right. The way life works.'' \n \n The words had no ulterior motive behind them, yet Qard was simultaneously reassured and chilled by them. Reassured that this culture was so steeped in warfare that they believed it was the universal order of life, and chilled by the same fact. There was no doubt that humans could win this war, but there was also no doubt that they'd win many, many more after their first introduction to Fluan technology. \n \n The human's eyes snapped back to him. \n \n `` I'm sorry about your plight, but we have no way to fight on the fronts you've specified. We've barely colonized our own solar system; we do n't have the resources to wage an extra galactic war.'' \n \n `` Of course not,'' Qard said, a note of exasperation creeping into his voice. `` We do n't expect you to do so yourself. The Fluans have prepared a number of vessels capable of faster than light travel. A... fleet.'' He hesitated not because he did n't know the word, but because'fleet' should never have been used to describe Fluan spacecraft. The assorted ships were used chiefly for exploration, business travel, or pleasure. The thought of a Fluan diplomacy yacht spitting death nearly made Qard himself violent. \n \n `` They have few weapons. Our engineers will work with you to outfit them with whatever you need or desire. Once the war is finished, whether we win or lose, the vessels will be yours to keep and study.'' Not the full truth. Humans could study them right up until The Council of Flua remotely detonated them. Humanity was n't quite ready to join FTL civilizations yet. \n \n `` And how about our numbers?'' She asked. `` Including our colonies, we number 28 billion. A fraction of that would fight for you. Is that enough?'' \n \n `` Your numbers are sufficient.'' He did n't mention that humans reproduced at an unusually high rate compared to the rest of known life forms. Their numbers were n't completely ideal, but they'd easily make up the difference. \n \n `` Excellent. Last question, then. I am the Primary Elected Leader of the Terra System. I can guarantee majority support by both the High Military and High Civilian Representatives. The question is, why should I? Why should we choose a war to introduce ourselves to the universe, and why yours?'' \n \n A question Qard had not been expecting. He and the Fluan Council had assumed that the novelty of a new form of fighting, and the vast resources offered by the galaxy at large, would be motivation enough. \n \n `` We have the respect of a great many civilizations. If you were to help us, the trade opportunities-'' \n \n `` Then why are n't they fighting for you?'' she cut in. \n \n Qards felt his antennae stiffen, the equivalent of a human narrowing their eyes. `` They fear our enemy more than they respect us. Defeat the Cramoul and you'll have respect as our allies, and fear as Cramoul's vanquishers. Humans have a great capacity for violence, which is why we come to you now. We face near extinction. You will prove your place among the greater civilizations by staving off genocide. It is a guarantee that no other planet will offer as much. And we have not communicated the location of your planet. If you lose, you can vanish to your home system without a trace. Even we Fluans found you by accident.'' \n \n Her eyes became unfocused once more. \n \n `` Yes. Yes, I think that will do.'' \n \n * * * \n \n Fifteen years later, the Cramoul were pushed back to their homeworld. With victory accomplished and celebrations competed, humanity returned to Terra, and Flua betrayed them by detonating the FTL drives, as planned. \n \n Four years after that, the Fluan Council surrendered to Primary Commander Margaret Waller, of Terra.\n"}

We aint the ones came askin' for help are we? It were you and your fella needed a hand out and was willing to pay the price down the road.'' \n \n Glenna inhaled deeply. `` I know that. He knows it. But... is there really any point in making us twist in the wind while you act all dramatic and theatrical about it?'' \n \n Hexam nodded. `` Girl's got a point Madge.'' She turned to Glenna `` Yer gon na have't'get another one.'' \n \n We stared blankly for a moment. `` What do you mean'get another one'? Are we supposed to act like a brood mare and stallion and start shaggin' away until we've got another bun in the oven?'' \n \n Blackhammer shook her head. `` No, that wo n't do at all dearie. We ca n't be having a second born, we was each promised a first born y'see.'' \n \n My brain felt like a car engine that had failed to turn over. `` We can each only have one first born, how the hell are we supposed to have another kid that's also first born?'' \n \n Hexam looked at me like I was a total prat. `` I did n't say you had to *have* another first born child. I said you need to *get us* another child. Madge's right though, it'll have to be a first born. Obviously it ca n't be another one born from your misses, and it ca n't be one that you've planted in another lady. You'll have to adopt one, or steal one or buy one from a desperate woman or something.'' \n \n `` Do you have any idea the difficulty involved in that?!'' Glenna said. \n \n `` That's for you two to sort out.'' Hexam retorted. \n \n `` Well, we're certainly not going to do anything illegal! The adoption thing might work though. It'll take years to get through all the bureaucracy, but we can manage I suppose.'' \n \n `` Years? Oh no dear girl...'' Hexam frowned at her. `` We're gon na need a much smaller time table than that. We're already being generous here, do n't go pushing it.'' \n \n `` It's not a matter of me pushing. Breaking the law will risk us getting thrown into prison. I know that's'not your problem', but it wo n't get you another baby either, which is your problem. Then there's a limit to what we can do through official channels though. Do you have any idea what it's like to go through an adoption process?'' \n \n `` Course we do n't. That's the whole point've bein' a witch innit? Being removed from the drudgery of the mortal world.'' \n \n `` Well trust me, stuff like that takes a lot of time and patience. There's things that people need to check on and paperwork that needs to be filled out. It's a bloody nightmare. Still, it's the only way we can get you a second child that's also first born, so you can either take it, or figure out a way to share the one we've already had.'' \n \n A strange look passed between Blackhammer and Hexam that I would n't understand until much later. The look did n't last as long on Blackhammer's face though. It brightened up with inspiration. `` Maaaaybe there's another way dearie.

Blackhammer leaned over and whispered into Hexam's ear. \n \n `` Hmm...'' Hexam seemed to be mulling something over. `` Well, I guess that cooooouuuuld work. It'd be one of them nicely fitting technicalities that would make for a good bit've balance. Yeah. I think we've got a winner.'' \n \n Glenna sighed. When Hexam and Blackhammer glared at her she shrugged `` Whenever you're ready, but all this mysterious chatter is tiring, so I'd really appreciate if you let us in on this loop hole.'' \n \n `` Well dearie'' Blackhammer began `` It basically involves holes. Rather, it's a matter of swappin' yer hole out for a rod and swappin' yer hubby's rod fer a hole.'' \n \n We both looked dumbfounded at her. \n \n `` What Madge means'' Hexam began `` Is that we can still keep to the terms of the original bargain, but it'll require the two of you switching sexes, or gemders or whatever you call it these days.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] And then one day.. there was a hole there ...\n","story":"Life was much more simple last week. My brother worked his shift in the mines, along with my father and the rest of the town men old enough to handle a pick. My mother was preparing dinner as the mines had let out early to celebrate the holiday. It was Tor-Hanna; the day we were freed from our captors. Before my grandfather's grandfather had been born a war was waged in which the beings of the light defeated those of the miasma. Or so we are all told; none are alive from that time. \n \n I had just returned from fishing the small stream that ran south of the town when the ground shook slightly. This was n't uncommon as the ground tended to `` bump'' to release pressure from the massive mine that had been carved beneath the surface. As I continued home it got worse and there was a massive explosion. Mine collapses happened... but this was far bigger than the one that killed my grandfather and my uncle. I knew my family would be safe because their shifts would already have ended. \n \n A cloud of dark red smoke began to billow into the sky. The thick smell of sulfur overtook me as I gagged and ran towards the mayhem. My house was destroyed. The wall facing the catastrophe was gone, my mother lay under the table unconscious, and my brother was staggering down what was left of the stairwell. He had a large piece of debris sticking out of his thigh and coverall was matted thick with blood. My father had lost his left hand below the elbow. He'd already tied a tight tourniquet around the wound and was trying desperately to dig my mother out. After a few seconds it became apparent that she was n't alive; her neck had been crushed by debris from the collapsing wall. I had thought wrong. \n \n In the days that followed the hole opened up and swallowed more and more of the town. It was obvious that the area was much larger than even the massive mine. It was deep, maybe half a mile or better. On the dawn of the third day the vortex appeared. It was small at first, but then things began to emerge from it. Dark shadows that scaled the steep walls in seconds and began to disperse throughout the town. People went missing in the following hours, and more and more strange things began to appear. \n \n A creature the size of a horse with six legs and a caprice as hard as stone killed the town police chief before nightfall. I watched helplessly as he shot it point blank with a powerful shotgun only for it to grab him with it's claws and tear him to pieces. It wandered towards the hole and I had n't seen it since. \n \n That was last week. Today we dropped a large rock down the hole. It landed directly in the vortex and disappeared. We lowered another down with a long rope and were able to pull it back after a few minutes. It seemed no worse for the wear. Tomorrow they plan on sending my brother down to pass through. He volunteered to make the trip and no one dissented. \n \n Except for me. His leg is still wounded to the point that he ca n't walk without a limp. He has at least two or three broken ribs judging by the thick purple and yellow bruises covering his chest, and he's at least temporarily deaf in one ear. \n \n So, tonight, I've tying the edge of a two mile long cord from the mine elevator to the sturdiest structure I could find in town. The remainder I looped around a thick oak that was longer than a man is tall. I'm at the bottom and..I'm going to go through. If I do n't return. Please do n't send help. I made this decision on my own. If I do return. I'll do my best not to bring anything else back with me. May the light help us. \n \n \\- Edward Fanstin - February 29th, 2432\n"}

Hermione said, annoyed at the tardiness of their new teacher. \n \n `` Who is this guy anyway?'' Harry asked Hermione, oblivious to the identity of their new defense against the dark arts teacher. \n \n `` He's a huge name in the wizarding world Harry! How can you NOT know who he is? This is Gregory House! He personally took down several huge criminals before leaving to study the Muggle world.'' Ron said as the door flung open with a slam. \n \n `` Hello class, I am your new defense against the Dark Arts teacher. My name is Gregory House, and if you have any questions then you are far too stupid to be in this class. My class will be taught unlike any other teacher at this school, because I will also be incorporating defense against muggle weaponry as well.'' A tall man said as he walked into the room, the tapping of the cane echoing through the classroom. \n \n `` Who do you think you are coming late to your own class? And what kind of foolishness is this, learning about muggle weaponry?'' Malfoy shouted at Professor House, his face turning red. Without a word, Professor House stuck his hand into his pocket to produce a black rod that most of the students had never seen before. Most assumed that it was a wand of some sort, and watched as he aimed it at Malfoy. \n \n `` Ladies and Gentlemen, please take a look at this young man! He is far too stupid to be in this class for the rest of this year, and luckily for you all, I will be answering his question of why we are learning Muggle weaponry this year as well.'' Professor House answered, flicking a small button on his wand. Initially, it seemed to have cast a Lumos spell, but after a minute Malfoy began vomiting on the floor, and collapsed. \n `` Now can anyone answer me how I did that? You there, the pudgy kid trying to hide. How did I incapacitate that idiot without a spell?'' \n \n `` I... Uhh... Think that you... Used a poison on him before class?'' Neville answered, stuttering in his answer. \n \n `` Wrong on many levels you imbecile. I came to class thirty minutes late, a sizeable amount of time where I could n't touch him without everyone else seeing. I could n't have known that one particular student would talk back to me, and I used this fool as a demonstration BECAUSE he talked back to me. You with the brown hair in the front, what is the answer?'' \n \n `` You used a flashlight with different wavelengths to stimulate different parts of his brain, causing nausea and for him to vomit.'' Hermione answered, confusing the entire class. \n \n `` Correct! 10 points to whatever the hell you guys are. We are studying Muggle weaponry because it is far more efficient that magic because it has no need for someone to scream whatever spell they are using like an idiot, anyone can use it with training, and it has been refined through several wars that would make the wizarding world cower in fear. Anybody have any snide remarks like that other gentlemen, or shall we start?'' Professor House asked as he produced a small bottle and swallowed a pill. \n \n `` Sir, how did you know I knew what that was?'' Hermione asked \n \n `` You had several clues of being a Muggle born wizard. When I pulled the flashlight out, everybody in the class thought it was a wand and just watched. You on the other hand saw a flashlight, and looked extremely confused initially. The fact that you are in front means that you are a kissass, and a kissass will try to know as much as possible on their teacher. The past two decades I have been in the Muggle world working as a doctor, and you must have looked at my records and complaints to see what kind of person I am. This flashlight was the reason for one of those complaints, so I knew that you knew.'' Professor House answered, shocking every student in the room. \n \n `` Now that I have everyone's attention, it is time to explain why I am here. I am looking for assistants to work with me in solving cases. Whomever that I deem worthy shall have the right to work with me. Whomever I consider to be morons shall be failed from my class. I have 3 spots open for this class of 30, so start choosing whether to kiss my ass, rise to the occasion, or avoid my wraith. Class is dismissed.''

They all say it. `` You're so lucky!'' \n \n Everybody is looking forward to Transcription, but I only see death in that word. \n \n Most people are n't Transcribed unless they are very old or very wealthy, and usually both. For the poor and middle class it's just not going to happen. \n \n But even the Transcribed have needs. There's an economy in there. There's a polity and consistency. And the old and wealthy are not known for their ability to serve others. \n \n So the `` best and brightest'' of the other class, the _under_ class can pay their way into immortality by getting `` service grants''. It's indenture, pure and simple. And to get one you have to go to this terrible school. \n \n Since residual self image is important, you must be physically fit and pretty. Those ugly old folks do n't want to spend eternity with plain people at their virtual pool parties or whatever. I'm not on the personal entertainment track, so I'm not that, uh, vapid. I'm okay looking for a norm, but for this school I'm the ugly dog out. \n \n There are other tracks. Menial. Functional. Specific Talent. All sorts of things. These people are paying good money for their immortality and they want it populated with `` qualities''. \n \n The transcribed are also on the net, and can still control the world out here through virtual presence and all that. \n \n But I'm on a new track. I'm being trained as a Transcription tech, but to operate on the process from the other side. But that means I've been learning things. Things that even the transcribed do n't know. Things that the people running the system here do n't seem to know. \n \n There are repeating patterns. Fractal shortcuts in the methodology. Lots of other words for lots of other problems along the same lines. \n \n I went digging. Did you know that most of the people who invented this system did n't Transcribe? All the inventors had a free pass to do so but most of them just sold their slots to the wealthy. \n \n These people, the Transcribed, whatever they are, are not really themselves. They are approximations of their former selves that have been programmed not to notice the differences. \n \n Transcription was supposed to be mankind's ticket off this rock. It was supposed to let us take the human experience to other worlds, along with our genome, and have parents, abet virtual, to raise the children and preserve history. But the whole thing was sold out to the high bidders and we never left. \n \n These idiots think eternity is in this damn box. \n \n I've made modifications to my own template. Hopefully I'll know and remember what the process makes others forget. Hopefully I'll be able to repair and improve it all from within. I've tweaked my parameters. Snuck extra storage and extra processing. I've made every trade and improvement I can think of. \n \n It's too late to quit. My parents have been living off my indenture for some years now. \n \n In two days, eighteen hours, twelve minutes, and thirty seven seconds they're going to force my brain through a sieve like so much mechanically separated chicken.

I ca n't wait for the next Writer to be chosen. I'm sick of 2016 already. Everything has turned to shit. We have incompetent people running for president of the United States, North Korea has a fetish with weapons, the protagonist, ISIS, is causing more harm than anyone could have thought, we have a Brexit in the works ( which will be hell for the next Writer ), Greece had a monetary meltdown, and Turkey has been usurped by its own military.'' \n \n I nod my head, listening to the rant of my fellow coworker. Gretchen has always been high-strung, but she's been my friend since I first started here. \n \n Gretchen lets out a sigh. She shakes her head, her short brown hair not moving at all due to the absurd amount of hairspray she uses everyday. `` At least the Writer is giving me plenty of inspiration...'' \n \n I nod again. You see, Gretchen, myself, and all the future would-be writers work together. We all work in conspiracy. It's our job to pump out as many stories as we can while trying to make them appear as factual as possible, then post them onto the internet or slip them into magazines, news papers, or television somehow. The top three conspiracy theorists get their names placed in a hat on New Years, and from those three the next year's Writer is selected... \n \n Gretchen starts going off again about 2016. I'm not paying attention anymore. Instead, my mind drifts. I start thinking about how I would change the world if I was the Writer for 2017. \n \n Suddenly, there's a ding on my computer, followed by several dings elsewhere in the office. Everyone falls abruptly silent, eyes wide as they read the instant message. \n \n'INCOMING. BOSS ARRIVAL IN 60 SECONDS.' \n \n Thank god the Secretary likes all us would-be writers! Her warning resonates throughout the office. Everyone dashes to their chairs and pretends to be typing away. Gretchen and I duck into our cubicles. All conversation has stopped. The air is tense, waiting. \n \n The elevator dings. Everyone seems to be holding their breath. The arrow above the doors lights up, then the metal slides apart. \n \n There stands the boss. He's an older man with an orange complexion and bright blonde ( but thinning ) hair sitting atop his round, scrunched face. Our boss is dressed in a power suit of black. There are others in the elevator too. Probably Corporate. The boss' eyes sweep the office before he exits. He walks with authority, and no one dares make eye contact as he leads the way upstairs toward his glass cubicle, where he can lord over all of us. His entourage follows swiftly. No one speaks. When the glass closes behind the group of executives and the Writer, everyone lets out a sigh of relief. \n \n A few seconds later, Gretchen peers over the wall of my cubicle. \n \n `` You know, I think he only put himself on the ballot so that when 2017 rolls around, he'll still have influence over us even though his term is over.'' \n \n I look up. `` Probably, but we'll have to see. He may not get elected. I wrote a scathing theory yesterday discrediting his daughter by claiming she plagiarized from Michelle Obama. People have been eating it up.'' \n \n `` You're the only one who writes anything against him, you know. I'm surprised he has n't fired you yet. He loves to fire people.'' \n \n It's not news to me. I know I'm going against the mainstream. I shrug and say, `` I know. I'm pretty sure he just keeps me around because no matter what I write, it still gives him more publicity. That's all he's after, really. He wants the cameras and all the attention.'' \n \n It's Gretchen's turn to nod. She does n't say anything else, and eventually slides back down into her cubicle. \n \n I look behind her, gazing toward the glass box where the Writer sits at his desk. He's watching me. I stare back, but he does n't break his gaze. He speaks to the people in the room without looking away, but I do n't think he's talking about me. I grow bored with him, and turn away. \n \n Despite all his influence, I've never liked him. My distrust in him is what fuels my stories. My fingers begin furiously typing on the keyboard, pounding out another discrediting rumor as fast as they can. Maybe, if I write enough of these, people will come to their senses. Even if I do n't become 2017's Writer, I think a hell of a lot of good will come if 2016 is n't elected as President.\n"}

She stands there, barely an outline in the pitch dark of the corridor, clutching her plush toy to her chest and looking up at me through curious, calculating eyes. That plush toy is the only thing telling me she's really there. It's bright as the fourth of July sky. \n \n `` Yes.'' I say. Barely audible. `` I suppose I am.'' \n \n Is a villain who admits to his crimes still a villain? Probably. Though with the world as morally bankrupt as it is, there are nothing but villains. Only question is how much of a villain are you. \n \n `` Why are you so mean?'' She asks. \n \n I suppose I've gotten lucky in a sense. Children are more apt to scream bloody murder when confronted with a stranger, dressed in black holding a silenced pistol, in the wee hours of the morning. I'm grateful to whatever higher power might exist - divine or cosmic - that she's kept her peace. Of course, the downside is I'm dealing with her questions. \n \n It's my fault. I should have done a better job of surveying the mansion. Should have put the pieces together and realized there would be a very good reason for the swing-set outside, or the mini-van. Or any one of the forty-seven thing's I'd spotted outside that would indicate a child. Chalk it down to me getting sloppy in my old age and leave it there. \n \n `` A few reasons.'' It's a stupid answer, and I know it as soon as it passes my lips. An answer no child will accept. Children ca n't grasp the I-don't-knows in life. They are deal in absolutes. There's either an answer or there is n't. In many ways it's a simpler philosophy, an easier ride. Do or do n't. Will or wo n't. \n \n She steps out of the gloom as if emerging from a portal from another world. A leg first, barely longer than my forearm. Then a torso, a stuffed rabbit staring out at me from blank, dead eyes. At least there's no judgment there. Lastly her head, her curly dark hair a wild mane about her shapeless face. \n \n `` My Daddy gets mean sometimes too.'' She says, and then looks down on the floor. That much I guessed by looking at her. \n \n A dark bruise on the left side of her face. If I'd come a week ago it would have been fresh. Now it's as faded as old memories. \n \n `` So did mine.'' I say. `` But I'm sure your Daddy wo n't get mean again, as long as you're good.'' \n \n Daddy definitely wo n't get mean again. Daddy is asleep beside Mommy, a hole the width of a pinkie finger through their foreheads. It's a sleep neither of them will wake up from. \n \n Who wanted them dead and why, I do n't know. I do n't ask questions. I take the money and I pull the trigger. I'm a service. A hired gun, a knife in the dark. I'm a tool. All I know is that Daddy was a Senator and Mommy was fucking her boss. \n \n `` I'm sorry for what I said, you do n't seem so bad. What's your name?'' She asks with a smile. It's a smile that could sink a thousand ships, or melt a heart. It's warm. It's genuine. There are no second meanings, no lies. There's no pain, no hurt, and no suffering. \n \n I've known a smile like it before, but she was taken from me a long time ago. \n \n I realize there's no one around to hear me say it. No one to overhear if I share. `` It's Matt.'' I say, trying to give her a smile back. At best I think I manage a baring of the teeth. \n \n `` Mine's Sarah.'' She replies. `` Can I go and see my Mommy and Daddy? I ca n't sleep too well in my own room.'' She gestures to the door behind me, where her mother and father's corpses lie. \n \n `` It's best if you do n't.'' I say. `` They left strict instructions not to be disturbed until morning time. In fact, I think it's time you went back to bed. It's a Wednesday tomorrow, you do n't want to be late up for school.'' \n \n Sarah's eyes flit between her parent's room and my gaze. She looks confused, she looks like she does n't understand. Then she yawns and nods her head. \n \n `` I think you're right.'' She says, and then turns around. She begins to pad down the corridor, back to her own room I'm guessing. \n \n `` It's nice meeting you, Matt.'' She tosses over her shoulder, in between yawns. \n \n No, I thought, It is n't. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Every morning you find a tarot card taped to your front door .\n","story":"******BZZZZ****** \n \n Justine swatted at the snooze button trying to ward off the morning for a just a few more minutes. Instead only succeeding in knocking the alarm clock off her nightstand and under her double bed. Grumbling she half rolled have oozed out of bed and onto the floor, blindly felt around and finally succeeded in both turning off the alarm and returning it to it's place of honor beside the Kleenex box and lamp. Just as she was about to settle back into bed to try and catch just a few minutes more of sleep the alarm she set on her phone, across the room on her dresser to prevent just this situation began to beep loudly. Justine sighed, this was just another day of the few things she had managed to purchase with her pitiful salary mocking her for existing. \n \n Justine set to work covering the yesterday stink with clinical deodorant and Victoria's Secret body spray, too tired to shower and actually prepare for work. Throwing her hair in a messy bun and grabbing the cleanest looking clothes from the dirty clothes pile next to the overflowing dirty clothes hamper Justine quickly dressed then stomped into the kitchen. \n \n Twenty minutes later stale poptart and the keys for her'98 Civic in one hand, and her bagged lunch and gym gear in the other Justine rushed out of the house. Justine turned to lock the door and cocked her head at the rectangular piece of cardboard stuck to the door. She almost did n't notice it, between her rush to get to work and the unlikelihood of their actually being a tarot card nailed to her front door she almost looked right past it. But there, stuck to her door with a nail that Justine was completely unable to remove by hand ( and would have to remember to try later with a hammer, or get the super to, because she did n't own a hammer. ) was a card with a pentagram crudely drawn on it. \n \n Justine eventually gave up attempting to remove the nail and just yanked the card off her door, wondering if there was some message behind it. Perhaps to join some weird Tarot themed cult, or to try the new Holistic healing center down the road. But no, there was nothing other than the card itself, this puzzled Justine and so, before heading out to work Justine took a picture with her smart phone and had Siri do some research for her. \n \n *'' The Ace of Pentacles'' * Reported the robotic voice *'' the Ace of Pentacles signifies a new opportunity. Expect a new job, a pay rise, a financial gift or a new investment opportunity. `` * \n \n Justine liked the way that sounded, shoved the card in her pocket and jumped in her'98 Civic to head to work. Self-assured that nothing would change and that this was just some sick prank played, perhaps by her annoying little brother, on someone that could really use some luck. \n \n Eleven hours later Justine parked and plugged in her car. Her brand new Tesla Model S that she still could n't believe she had won. Today had been a whirlwind, first the unexpected promotion and the huge pay raise, then the sweepstakes win at lunch for being the 1 millionth mall customer, then on the way home she had been given a card by a talent agent interested in casting her in an upcoming movie that was filming in town. It all felt surreal. She almost giggled herself to sleep, exhausted by all the adrenalin from what was without question the best day she had ever and possibly would ever have. \n \n Justine woke before her alarm, jumped out of bed and raced for the shower. After cleaning thoroughly and spending an extra few minutes ensuring that every strand of hair was in she grabbed the outfit she had bought a few months ago but was up until today, too self conscious to wear. With protein shake in hand, and her gym bag slung over her shoulder Justine almost skipped out of the house to her new car. \n \n Justine took a deep breath before turning to lock the door, half praying for another card and half hoping that her life would n't be decided by fate today. She exhaled and turned. Just as she half-expected, a card was attached to the nail thoroughly embedded in her door. \n \n Justine took a picture with her smart phone, and listened as Siri rattled off an explanation. \n \n `` Well fuck'' Justine said, and with dread in her heart, she headed to work.\n"}

Well, to be honest, I do n't know how I would have acted. Maybe nothing would have changed. Maybe everything would have. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n I watched for ages as other people controlled my body, lived my life, made my decisions. They came and they went, but it was always them in control.

Eventually, though, I gave up on that regard - nothing seemed to work. \n \n And so I sat there, night after night, on the chair in the corner, watching my own body sleep for a few hours before drifting off myself. Sometimes I tried to give the strangers dreams, influence their choices. I'm not sure whether that ever worked, or if the times the choices they made lined up with my desires was due to coincidence. \n \n One Saturday morning, I awoke in the bed. *Strange*, I thought to myself.

Instead, an old friend lurked -- one he had not heard since the beginning. A darkness that lurked within him, a rough tone of vengeance that promised sinister things -- thing that not even he would dream of doing. \n \n `` Hello my old friend, what do they call you now -- the dark knight?'' A twisted scarred grin crinkled along uneven edges as it contorted into a smirk, viewing the figure at the far end of the alley. What a fall from grace; savior of the city to lurking in dirty side alleys in the night. \n \n `` Have you come to tell me to stop, brother? Or to join me?'' \n \n `` Join you in a sudden mad twist of fate -- you were once the hero of this city, the sight of the bat one that brought joy to people's hearts -- hope even. And now... now it seems that the coin has flipped over... is this what has been lurking in your soul? A dark beast that leaves its kills out like trophies?'' \n \n He laughed then, a laugh that sent anger bubbling up in his veins. Yes, go ahead. Laugh at the Joker. That's what they had always called him when he was younger. The Joker -- the Clown -- and to Mrs. Wayne, the woman who's heart was big enough for an orphan, the happiest part of her day. Back then, he had been full of life; of hope and optimism that someday he would change the world for the better. \n \n And then their parents had been killed -- lives snuffed out like matches in the rain. And though Mrs. Wayne had loved him as a son, they had never filled out official adoption papers, and while Bruce had Alfred to look after him... he had no one. Sure, Bruce had tried to cling to him, to hold together the tattered remains of his family. But the manor held too many memories of laughter and a joy that now brought a stabbing pain to the fragile little pieces of what heart remained. \n \n And yet even in those darkest of times, embers of hope still burned. A shared thirst for vengeance against those who had taken anything from them gave birth to the most ludicrous of plans; at its core, it was nothing more than an extreme telling of good cop, bad cop. Bruce would become the good cop, while he... well he thought, touching the jagged tips of his perpetual smile, that went without saying. \n \n `` Why now, brother? Why after all these years do you give in to the darkness -- why kill innocents?'' The Joker asked softly, falling in next to his brother in all but blood at the edge of the roof. \n \n `` Take the stupid make up off,'' he muttered, ignoring his question. `` I ca n't talk to you when we're still in these stupid roles.'' It had rained a good part of the day, so it was no matter to scoop up dirty rainwater, splashing and scrubbing his face clean of the mask he wore better than his own face most days. \n \n A beat of silence stretched the gap between the two, at its edges a darkness deeper than the night that surrounded them. \n \n `` They killed her,'' he said finally, \n \n `` They've killed a lot of people Bruce, they're the Mafia,'' it felt wrong somehow to live up to his namesake by joking at a time like this. \n \n `` No. They killed -- her -- they killed them.'' Bruce turned to look at him then, and in his gaze, a light flared to life. It was more than just darkness that haunted the dark circles below his eyes -- more than anger that darkened normally dark brown to black. Pain. The Joker saw a pain so all-consuming -- he had not seen such pain since the day they stood by polished coffins as they were lowered into the deep dark Earth. \n \n `` Oh.'' That was all that he could say. It was all that needed to be said. \n \n `` Will you join me, Brother?''

He freezes for a second until he realized his fortune cookie must have been right. \n \n He bolts out of the restaurant as he hears Chinese shouting from behind him and three men in pursuit of him. He ran to his shop next door because they always had a shotgun in the back after a robbery last month. As he fumbles with the door key, the three men began shooting and shouting. They shot out the window right as Tony got the door opened and took off inside to the back office. Luckily, their store used to be a bank, so the back office had concrete walls so he could hopefully hold them off until the police arrived. \n \n As Tony secured the office door, gunshots were ricocheting off the store inventory and the walls. He was absolutely mortified. He picked up the phone and began to dial 911. \n \n `` Emergency Services, what is your emergency?'' \n \n `` Yes, this is Tony Morgan. My wife was just shot and I'm being chased by three men with guns. I need help now! I'm at...'' \n \n The line disconnected. \n \n He hung he phone up and tried again on his cell phone. \n \n `` Emergency Services, what is your emergency?'' \n \n `` This is Tony Morgan again. I was...'' \n \n `` Sir. You're on your own. Do n't waste your time calling. Everyone is already after you.'' Click. \n \n \n Tony's mind is racing. He has no idea what to do. He looks at the monitor with the security cameras and sees the three men scouring the store's inventory as if they're looking for something. He loads his shotgun and keeps watching the cameras in hopes they'll find whatever they're looking for and leave so he can escape. \n \n On the monitor he sees four police officers walk in and join the Chinese men in their search. They're throwing everything around, looking under everything, and crashing the display cases. \n \n `` What are they looking for?!'' Tony wonders out loud. `` What on earth have I done?!'' \n \n He begins to look around the office where they keep new inventory and in the corner he sees a large box he did n't notice before they left. It was addressed to him. This was odd since normally packages are always addressed to the store name. So he opens it. \n \n `` No. This ca n't be real. This ca n't be here. I ca n't have this. I have to get out of here.''\n"}

As she blinked a few times, attempting to clear her vision, she heard a voice muttering beside her. \n \n `` This is miraculous, a creature and human meld...'' The girl turned her head to attempt to see who was speaking and saw a long haired blond male in a black robe, his back turned to her. As if he felt her eyes on him he turned. His eyes were odd, one eye larger than the other, their color similar to that of a perfectly frozen lake. He grinned, and it sent chills down her spine. \n \n `` Ahhh, awake I see. You are a strange creature, one that I am keeping for myself for testing. Not even Lord Xemnas knows you are here.'' He smiled again, and the poor girl could n't help but find him to be one of the most frightening things in existence. \n \n `` Where... where is'here' and who are you...?'' Her voice trailed off, trying to remember how she got there or even...'' Who am I?'' \n \n The male walked up to her, and began touching her hair softly. `` You, my dear, are now known as Xyleena. Your past name, Leenya, but with the `` X'' of a Nobody thrown in. Why exactly we do that, I do n't know. As for me? My name is Vexen, and here is Castle Oblivion.

But his question made her think, what *did* happen before she came here? \n \n `` I....was with my little brother... we were being attacked by Heartless....'' she closed her eyes to help her remember the scene. The screams her brother made as a Heartless, once their father, came in and began beating and tearing at them. `` I tried to save him...'' she recalled rushing to get in between her brother and the Heartless, willing to take the blows to save his fragile life. Her kitten, Lanii, had come to her after she could take no more and was laying on the floor awaiting death. `` And that's all I can remember.'' \n \n Vexen took a finger and wiped the tears off the girl's face, and coldly put the few drops into a vial for future use. `` I see.

Two matching chairs were affixed to the floor, faced each other on opposite sides of the table. One Shane was sitting on, the other's occupant had left the room tens of minutes ago. \n \n Shane had tried to open the door long ago but found it to be locked. He had paced the room until he was bored and returned to his seat. Unconsciously, he brought his hands down on the table in a rhythm of his own making. He noticed what he was doing and quit, everyone found it offensive. Shane did not want to be disciplined on his 14th name day. \n \n Everyone on their 14th name day receives the Taste Test which determines what class of citizen they are. A clamp is placed on the tongue and little pads are placed around the head. Someone controls a computer as it goes through a cycle of tests, the analyzed results known as the Six Flavours. \n \n Shane was confident he could become a 4th class citizen, some of whom become royal musicians and play at all the large ceremonies. Most people become 6th class and work the fields. 1st class citizens are the ones who held society together. In order to perform their duties, the 1st class are above the law. \n \n A quiet buzz emanating from the other side of the door announced the release of the electronic lock. The test administrator who wore an immaculate white lab coat entered the room. Her sunken, blue eyes expressionless as she returned to her seat. She was followed by a man wearing the uniform of the 1st class citizenry. \n \n His face held no wrinkle but still appeared aged to Shane's eye. His white skin looked off colour, almost as if it had been dyed. He wore a smile that never reached his eyes. Eyes that had been fixed to Shane since entering the room. \n \n `` Greetings Shane, my name is Alexander McNaught and you have surprised us all with the results of your test,'' he said. He then clapped his hand onto Shane's shoulder, fingers tapping twice before lifting. \n \n Shane was shocked, no one is allowed to make contact with a 1st class citizen. His first instinct was to drop to the floor and beg forgiveness, but his curiosity took hold and he asked, `` What are the results of my test?'' \n \n Alexander laughed, looked to the administrator and said, `` you were right Elizabeth, this one is an unusual case. You will be rewarded for bringing this to our attention.'' \n \n Though Alexander remained smiling, chills ran down Shane's spine as he tried to understand. `` I know it is unusual for a First Class such as yourself to be here,'' he said, `` you would only be here if my results were important.'' \n \n The smile left Alexander's face and he said, `` yes actually you have become one of us now. The test results prove that you are First Class material.'' \n \n A wave of excitement passed through Shane as he processed that revelation. He never dreamed he could become 1st class, and now a world of possibilities opened before him. As Alexander continued to stare, his panic returned. `` There is more that your not telling me, I noticed the door lock behind you. Why are you keeping me in here?'' He asked. \n \n Alexander glanced to the door and back to Shane, eyes narrowed. `` Well, you are perceptive. I will give you that,'' he said, `` You have passed all the tests. An `` alltongue'' if you will. You are every class of citizen.'' \n \n Cringing under Alexander's glare Shane asked, `` what happens now?'' \n \n Alexander jumped behind Shane, restrained him, placed his arm out onto the table. `` You are an anomaly that could potentially damage the system we put in place. What if one of the lower classes was to learn a First Class citizen was also one of their own. How could we maintain order with one like you around,'' he said, `` Elizabeth it is time.'' \n \n Shane tried to escape as Elizabeth pulled a syringe out of a case from her pocket. She filled it with a substance from a glass bottle, tapping it as she pushed the plunger to remove the air. Alexander held Shane's arm steady as she found the spot she wanted. \n \n Shane's vision dimmed as the drugs flowed through his veins. He could hear Elizabeth's voice but had a hard time understanding. `` Three... Two... One...''\n"}

I feel a trickle of sweat drop down my brow, but I feel that familiar tremor after the judgement has passed and breathe a little better. Another day. \n \n I'm 52 years old. When I was a younger I barely had to think about all the things I wanted to live for: girls, sports, learning new things, new experiences, getting to see the future, etc. It was easy back then, but now that I'd done all those things I'd reached that turning point in my life where there were fewer and fewer things to look forward to. \n \n And yet I must live, or my family of seven will starve. A valid excuse, but a boring one, and if there's one thing the Merciful One can not stand it's repetition. \n \n Today I see the man. The oldest man who has ever lived. He is 219 years old. He lives alone in the top floor of a private hospital where he is attended to day and night by a fleet of doctors and nurses. Many seek his counsel on the topic of longevity, but all who have spoken with him so far have left disappointed. \n \n How can such a man not want to share his knowledge with the world, so that all can reap the benefits of long life? I am angry, but I mask it well as I enter the hospital. It is very hard to get an appointment with him, and I should count myself lucky that I get one at all. It is said that he has not spoken to anyone in twelve years. \n \n When the elevator doors opened I smelled his husk, and the dry rattling of his breath from the otherside of the corridoor. I followed the dispassionate nurse who led me to his bed, and I saw what looked like a withered child contemplating the agony of his existence. \n \n He took notice of me in a detached kind of way, and closing his eyes, resigned himself to a conversation. `` Assk....'' he whispered. \n \n I cleared my throat, and keeping my tone even and neutral asked the question that so many before me had asked: `` How do you do it? What reason do you give to the Merciful One above that lets him grant you such a long life?'' \n \n His eyes remained shut, and for a moment I thought he'd fallen asleep, or worse. Then suddenly he choked and coughed, a faint spittle of blood decorating his gown in a manner that seemed to suggest that it was not his first time. \n \n Drawing breath, the old man answered me, and the words said that day I would take to my grave: \n \n `` It makes him happy... to watch me suffer...''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A demon saves a family from an angel .\n","story":"`` Heh. The angel over at the Robertson's house is falling. She's been with the family for years but she keeps arguing with God for power. Wan na come watch? The house is pretty well cleansed so we ca n't go inside but it'll still be a riot.'' My friend, Kilro, imparts to me after a night of haunting an innocent child's dreams together. \n \n `` Maybe. Which angel is it?'' I say, slightly interested. \n \n `` A new one... Umm... About a couple hundred years old. About your age. Umm.. What's her name?'' He says. \n \n My stomach ( or where my stomach would be if I had a proper one ) starts to ache. It is a leftover thing from when I was human that means I'm feeling uneasy. I think I know which angel he's referring to. \n \n `` Agnus?'' I offer, wincing a bit at the name. \n \n Kilro slaps his green, scaley hands together and says: `` That'' s it! How'd you know?'' \n \n `` We have unfinished business.'' That's all I feel comfortable offering about the subject but it is extremely vague for the circumstances we'd been through, Agnus and I. \n \n `` Are you okay, Lob?'' Kilro asks, fixing his yellow eyes on me. \n \n `` Yeah. Yeah just... I need to haunt my home base. The Larsons have gotten just enough rest to think they're safe. I'll catch you later.'' I answer, knowing that that explanation wo n't be questioned. \n \n `` See ya.'' Says Kilro, picking his nose absently. \n \n As I head to my home base I reflect on Agnus. She's the reason I am what I am now. We used to be married. She broke my heart. I spiralled into madness and sold my soul before I hung myself due to the consequences. \n \n As I come up to the home I regularly haunt, I stop. My will just is n't in this now. I want to get back at Agnus. I need to get back at her. \n \n I spin around on my heel and head to the Robertson's. Everyone knows where those do-gooders live. I just never knew it was Agnus supposedly protecting them. \n \n When I get there I'm taken aback by the light the house emits. Agnus ca n't be falling too fast if the place looks like this. Damn. \n \n I get as close as I can without feeling pain. That happens to be the front steps. \n \n `` Aggie!'' I shout before I can stop myself, surprised by the word as it comes out of my mouth. \n \n Then I see her. She's standing at the window and looks like a caricature of herself. She's in a white, flowing gown bathed in white light. I intake a breath sharply. \n \n `` Who-'' she starts, but then she looks into my eyes. They're the only thing that has stayed relatively the same except for their colour ( purple ). A look of recognition spreads pver her face, and then a look of contempt. \n \n `` Come out here. We need to talk. It has been long enough.'' I shout, folding my arms. \n \n Agnus floats through the door and crosses her arms, mirroring me. She always did that. \n \n `` What do -you- want?'' She asks rudely. \n \n `` Geeze. I thought angels were supposed to be nice. I just want to... Ummm...'' I start, but all the angry things I wanted to say to guilt her are gone. I just want to hold her. But I'm a demon. How is that possible? \n \n `` Oh, look at you. Have you been sucking up to God? You're getting a kind of glow. You sicken me.'' She says, turning away to walk off. \n \n `` Agnus! I never thought I'd say this but... I forgive you.'' The words come out of my mouth with a sour taste, but they're there and I mean them. \n \n Agnus scoffs. `` Forgive? What? I'm tired as shit of all these people forgiving me. As if I was a horrible person in life. As if. Wow. I'm a fucking angel, you know.'' Just as she says this, her glow starts to diminish and I feel a chill as a cloud covers the sun. \n \n `` Do n't you see, Agnus? You're falling. You've become prideful in your time as an angel. You need to stop or you'll end up like me.'' I say, feeling pain for her. \n \n `` Nope. Not becoming like you. You're soft. You're deteriorating. At this rate you're gon na be reborn human to get a second chance. What a horrible fate.'' Agnus says, almost spitting at the word'human.' \n \n At this point it's starting to rain and I can see Agnus falling further. `` At least leave those poor people alone. Dear God, do n't make those people have to deal with such a horrible fate. Please.'' I all of a sudden really feel what I'm saying and can see a sort of glow start to surround me. \n \n `` Newsflash: God does n't listen to demons. Let alone puny ones like you.'' Agnus retorts. \n \n In an instant Agnus starts to scream. She is sinking through the ground as if she's pudding going through a sponge. I warned her. She descended to hell. That's exactly what I was trying to prevent... However, God knows best. \n \n I can feel myself fill up with light and start to ascend. I can hear God in my head: `` Nathan. Let's give you another shot, shall we?'' \n \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Life after the zombie apocalypse\n","story":"Brie woke up cold, colder than usual even. Despite the cold, her pillow was lined with sweat from the back of her neck. While her toes were near frozen, her head was warm with thought. \n \n She threw off the covers and stepped over the 12-gauge on the floor. There was no light; a single matchbook lay near the candle but she dared not use it now. \n \n The darkness around her was unbecoming of the noon hour. It was a time that could only be conceived by mechanical means now, and the Rolex she had found long ago had not let her down. \n \n Brie showered, using the plastic bag apparatus she had conceived long ago. The water was cold, as was she. She had n't showered in weeks and she momentarily thought nothing of skipping another useless ritual but, regardless, she had a plan for the day and that as something new. \n \n The first new thing in quite a while, she thought. No time to be complacent. \n \n She showered, using a brown piece of soap with seams along the edge from having been negelected through the days. \n \n Clean, she stepped from the plastic sheeting surrounding her shower area and got dressed in the bedroom. She chose a simple outfit, a white tank-top covered by a long-sleeved black sweater, thermal underwear, jeans, socks and shin-high black boots. A quick glance in the mirror showed a brownish-black hairdo that hung down to her shoulder-blades. Her blue eyes, once an asset, now looked gray and forlorn, despite the anticipation she felt. Satisfied but not impressed, she walked down the stairs of the old house. It was apparently a Sears house, a bygone relic of the 1900s, when crates of lumber would weave their way through the heartland via rail. She only knew this because the previous residents had kept a running journal series, documenting the lives from the very first builder all the way until Mike and Michelle, which she could only assume were the previous owners. Mike and Michelle, of course, were nowhere to be seen. Only relics of their lives - scattered photos and journal entries - lived on as far as Brie knew. \n \n She had moved into the mansion only as a measure of protection. She had thought that, the bigger the house, the longer it would take for her to be found. There was also the consideration of hiding places - little nooks and crannies abounded within the halls of the big house and Brie was willing to find and take advantage of all of them if necessary. The journal had been a welcome distraction from the death that had taken place and, if nothing else, it would be a nice place to live, with its big oak beams and rounded doorways. She could die here happy, she had thought. \n \n But today was different - today was a day of hope. It was a rare day. \n \n Brie gather a few belongings and left the mansion, a task not easily accomplished due to the various booby-traps and overgrown vegetation. Even the sidewalks complained, groaning and shifting after years of non-use. It was rare for her to leave the house, and even when she left, it was n't by a single doorway. Brie felt confident that the front door, risky and exposed as it was, would be a good door to leave from today. Her boots clacked against the cold concrete. \n \n The dark and cold air surrounded her as she made her way down the sidewalk. The sun was gone now, a rather recent departure. Clouds and smog filled the atmosphere now, enough to even dampen the amber glow and only leave a smoky-gray ambiance that ruled for a few hours of the day. Plants already showed signs of death; even the dandelions that had dotted the roads for as long as she could remember were replaced by brown, cracked soil. Brie had no idea what month it was - she only knew it was cold and there was no snow. \n \n Brie set her eyes on the diner just down the road. Suddenly, despite the cold, her palms began to sweat. Another old ritual, one regarded by many as a sacred pastime, was about to take place. She was nervous, and she supposed he was too. \n \n But it was a beginning in a series of ends, and that was all that mattered right now. \n \n She hiked the 12-gauge onto her shoulder and kept walking.\n"}

I had n't been vaccinated my entire life. The amount of unnecessary diseases I have had in the last few years, and spread among my friends, would finally be over. \n \n `` Yeah, you're not getting vaccinated! ``, my mom was mad at the tv. We had been true followers of Fox News for years. I mean, I knew it was all BS, but my parents did not. The time I spent watching Bill O'Reilly and fellow anchors was truly surpassing the time I even spent at school. Well, to be fair, I was home schooled, so I did n't spend much time at the local school anyway. \n \n Living this Texas life had been hard on me. I knew I was a city boy, yet living in this spread out, way too hot, area had made me a zombie. I never felt like I belonged here, yet my parents would n't allow me to leave. \n \n It's not easy being a 16 year old kid. In all honesty I probably had an easier life than most other kids of my age. But I hated the way my life was set up. I woke up, took a shower, had breakfast, took some classes with my mom, had lunch, took more classes, had dinner, took a shower and went to bed. \n \n The internet took my world apart. I knew there was a better life to live and I knew I could easily reach the goals I needed to reach for myself. This whole autism vaccine was just another reason to leave my parents as soon as possible. I had to get out of here, I needed to get my life straight and live a life that I was made for. \n \n My parents were arguing about the news for at least 20 minutes now. I was totally done with it. I got up, went to Jimmy's room and just sat down next to him. \n \n Jimmy looked up to me every since he was younger. He was very intelligent kid, was not home schooled and just loved the live at his school. He always felt out of place here too. `` Have you heard the news? ``, I asked. He looked at me and said: `` I have, and I think I'm leaving this place''. Jimmy had a lot of plans for a 14 year old. \n \n `` That vaccine, I know it can save thousands of kids every year'', he continued. `` I really do n't want to be here, I need to find a way to help get this vaccine out there''. \n \n Jimmy and I had been planning some of the things we would do if we got the opportunity to get out of here. We would go to the big cities, travel around, get to know people. I never really thought he was too serious about it, but the look in his eyes that he had right now was so serious. \n \n `` Let's go'', I told Jimmy. `` Pack your shit, I'll get the car''. This was it, this was the moment we would get out of here forever. `` I'll meet you downstairs in 5 minutes''. \n \n I could hear my parents' voices coming from downstairs. Still arguing about the vaccine. Still swearing at the tv. I looked at Jimmy, Jimmy looked at me. We knew it was the right thing to do, we knew it was going to be better to leave. \n \n I went to my room and grabbed stuff, headed out the front door and started the car. Jimmy followed shortly. Then time just flew by, all I heard was the front door slam open, my dad yelling at us and my mom in tears. \n \n My dad ran into the garage and grabbed his gun. `` You guys are n't going anywhere''. I turned the key of the car and started driving. `` I said you guys are n't going anywhere!'' After all these years I knew how insane my dad could go when things did n't go according to his plan. But I did n't expect this. \n \n My dad was a true Texan. If it did n't go his way, he would make sure that it still was. I could see the barrels of the gun pointed at us. I started driving. He was still aiming at us. Every second felt like an hour. My dad run up the road. I had to get past him. \n \n I started driving faster. My dad was now 50 yards away, still aiming his gun at us. `` You better get out of the car, Jimmy!''. Jimmy was scared. Hell, I was scared. I started driving faster. I was now 30 yards away. My dad looked like he was about to shoot us. 20 yards. `` Stop the car! ``, he said. 10 Yards. I felt like my entire life was flashing in front of my eyes. \n \n All I could hear was a bang. The front window shattered. I panicked. I looked to my right and saw blood on Jimmy's face. I looked at my hands, there was blood everywhere. I felt like I was dying. This was a horrible way to go. Yet I did n't feel any pain. \n \n I looked in my left mirror and saw him laying there. My dad, crawled up. \n \n It's ironic that the autism vaccine still killed people.\n"}

The page, when read, that would let the words flow into the lucky reader. Gifting them the power and knowledge that each book held. \n \n The downside was it was a one person per book deal.

Taking aim she heaved the bound collection of'Unnatural Acts And How To Perform Them' towards Kyle Undertone. It neatly struck him on the back of the head knocking him to his knees, making him lose his grip on the book he'd been about to read. Which was quickly scooped up by Angel Pillgum as she ran past him. \n \n It served him right. They'd had the same idea to skip the crowd packed around the main library door and try to slip in by the small entrance around the back. Only he saw her coming behind him and, unforgivably, *locked the door after him*. By the time she'd got around to the main entrance again she was one of the last to get inside. \n \n A roll of thunder shook the building and she watched Angel, now showered in a million sparks float up from between the bookcases and into the air. Kyle, still dazed, was fumbling through the books scattered around his feet, searching for something he had n't yet noticed was gone. \n \n Rachel was pleased she got to screw over Kyle, who had been a huge dick to everyone, but she could n't stay to gloat when she still had to find herself a book. She ran down the ransacked aisles searching in vain. The obvious books, the powerful, the well known, the notorious, they were always the first to be taken. Popular topics were next, with so many fighting over a few texts they were soon striped clean. Then it was whatever you could find. Travelling deeper into the library she kept looking for something that was right for her. But no matter where she went, someone else was there. \n \n She found Hue holding'The Encyclopaedia of Magical Necessity' while searching the reference section. His skin displayed a rapid mix of charts, graphs and words as he absorbed it. \n \n Augusta had got to the travel guides first and had found'Oz, Neverland And Through The Looking Glass: A Guide To Magical Lands.' And promptly vanished once she looked inside the cover. \n \n She skipped the potion books. Julia and Ram were using them to beat each other as they fought over the slim volume they had at their feet. \n \n Dejected Rachel slumped against the rolling steps and sighed. And promptly regretted thinking `` could it get worse'' as it rolled away from under her, leaving her sprawled on the floor. \n \n As she lay on the old carpet her eyes ran over the spines of the nearest books. \n \n'Limbo: Dance Instructions For Ghosts' \n \n'Warts And All, A Tell All Biography Of A Witch' \n \n'High Spirits. Undead Addiction Advice' \n \n'1001 Worst Wishes' \n \n She reached for the book of wishes. She was n't gong to choose it, just read about someone who had a worst day than her. But as she pulled it from the shelf a soft thud sounded. Another book was jammed behind the ones she could see. It must have fallen behind from a higher shelf and been hidden from sight. She pulled out a few more books to see what new pointless publication she had found. \n \n It was smaller than she thought. Not just the thickness, maybe a hundred pages at most, but the book was only slightly larger than her hand. But rather than seeming flimsy it gave the impression of being concise.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] An atheist is having a debate with someone who , unknown to him , is actually Satan in human form .\n","story":"\u201c Not following your family in? \u201d \n \n Brian looked up, startled. Standing above him was a slim man in a powder blue sports jacket and white slacks. He gave Brian a faint smile. Normally, Brian would ignore any strangers that approached him. This Starbucks was notorious in being a panhandlers hub but there was a warmth in this man \u2019 s eyes that spoke of inexhaustible understanding. And it made Brian want to answer that warmth. \n \n \u201c My family? \u201d he echoed. \n \n The man made a slight motion with his chin towards the church across the street from them. \n \n \u201c I saw you dropping off your family there, \u201d he replied, taking a seat next to him without invitation. \u201c Your wife and son. But you didn \u2019 t follow them in. \u201d \n \n From the outdoor patio seating, you could see the last few stragglers hurrying into the church, walking through the doors in that exaggerated tiptoe manner that all latecomers had. \n \n Brian shook my head. \u201c No, I \u2019 m just the chauffeur, \u201d he said. \n \n The man \u2019 s eyes were a rich brown with flecks of green. They were wide set with lines of jocularity edging the corners. He would \u2019 ve looked like a kind high school science teacher Brian had once had in school except for the sports jacket. The powder blue color looked far too superficial for a man of such depth. \n \n The man tilted his head in curiosity. \u201c Why is that? \u201d he asked. When he saw Brian \u2019 s hesitation, he gave a brilliant smile, instantly meant to reassure him. \u201c I \u2019 m sorry. I don \u2019 t mean to pry but I come to this Starbucks every Sunday and I always see you walking back after dropping off your family and I \u2019 ve always been curious as to why you don \u2019 t go in with them. \u201d He gave a little shrug and smiled. \u201c I guess today I \u2019 m curious enough to finally ask. \u201d \n \n On any other day, asked by any other man, Brian would \u2019 ve told the person to fuck off and mind their own business. He would \u2019 ve felt disturbed and thoroughly creeped out by a man noticing his weekly behavior. \n \n But again, those warm brown eyes and that smile of familiarity, as if they were already old friends, swayed Brian. \n \n \u201c Church really isn \u2019 t my thing, \u201d he said with a slight, awkward shrug. \u201c My wife is the religious one. \u201d \n \n \u201c But your son? \u201d the man pressed. \u201c Won \u2019 t he be growing up religious as well since he \u2019 s going to church with your wife? \u201d \n \n Brian gave that same awkward shrug that was really more of a quick meeting of his shoulder blades than anything else. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t most of us start out that way? \u201d he said with a grin that was meant to be tongue in cheek but lost its bite in the face of the stranger \u2019 s solemn face. \u201c I grew up religious and then later made up my own mind about the ways of the world. I \u2019 m sure my son will be able to do the same, when time comes. \u201d \n \n The man pressed his lips together and nodded as if taking in everything Brian was saying with heartfelt sincerity. It made Brian suddenly feel a little important. He quickly forgot about his cup of Americano and folded up paper. He instead wanted this man to look at him again with that strange gaze of familiar understanding. \n \n \u201c And what kind of mind did you make up? \u201d he asked. \n \n Brian leaned in, confused. \u201c Pardon? \u201d \n \n \u201c What kind of mind did you make up about religion? \u201d the man clarified. \n Brian was about to answer but he paused, his mouth open, as he narrowed his eyes at the man. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re not a preacher, are you? \u201d he asked, suddenly suspicious. That warm look and gentle voice was exactly the kind of mannerisms you \u2019 d find in a preacher. \n \n The stranger laughed. His laughter was soft and easy going like his speech. He shook his head. \u201c No, not at all. Just a curious stranger, \u201d he replied, his eyes twinkling with humor. \n \n Brian relaxed again. \n \n A car drove by, careening out of the tiny strip mall parking lot. A smell of something rubbery and burning wafted towards them. \n \n *Goddamn idiot drivers. * Brian gave a quick glare towards the reckless vehicle and tried to ignore the smell. \n \n \u201c So religion, \u201d the man said, redirecting Brian \u2019 s attention back to the matter at hand. \u201c Not for you, eh? \u201d \n \n Brian shook his head. \u201c Not once I got older, \u201d he said. \u201c It \u2019 s easier to believe all of that when you \u2019 re younger. As a kid, your life is already defined by your dependence on others. On adults, parents, teachers. It only makes sense that you \u2019 d also be dependent on a god. \u201d \n \n The man opened his hand and then closed them, pressing the fingertips together. Brian noticed how long and elegant the man \u2019 s fingers were. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t think dependence has an age limit, \u201d he said ruefully. \u201c I \u2019 m sure most people find they depend on things well into old age. \u201d \n \n Brian nodded. \u201c I \u2019 m sure, \u201d he agreed. \u201c Drug addicts and alcoholics don \u2019 t do it for kicks and giggles. \u201d He quickly thought of his brother-in-law and his long battle with the bottle. \u201c But I think as you get older and you start going out into the world, you start to see how much work you have to put into your life to just live. You realize how much input you have and how much your actions create direct causal webs. I dunno\u2026.It was hard to believe someone was up there in the sky pulling the strings after all that. \u201d \n \n The man tilted his head. \u201c No family tragedies though? No personal traumas? Usually people leave the church because of some kind of brutal tragedy that leaves them shaken and wondering why a merciful God would do such a thing, \u201d he said. There was a glimmer of humor in his eyes and Brian wondered if he was teasing him. \n \n \u201c No, \u201d he answered, deciding to be straightfaced. \u201c Both parents are alive and healthy. My mother is actually a Sunday School teacher. Wife and kid are happy and healthy for the most part. I \u2019 ve got a good job and own my own house. Can \u2019 t ask for more, can you? \u201d \n \n Brian grinned, figuring this was a good ending point for the conversation. It was a good, light way to end a discussion that could easily become heated and dangerous. After all, he didn \u2019 t know this stranger \u2019 s beliefs and didn \u2019 t want to unknowingly step on his toes by saying something offensive, even though it was the stranger who had initiated the conversation. \n \n \u201c But that \u2019 s all the superficial stuff, is n't it? \u201d the man asked. \n \n Brian raised a brow, surprised by the question. He sniffed and wrinkled his nose, getting another whiff of that pungent burning smell. Had another car driven by while he had been talking? He hadn \u2019 t seen or heard one. \n \n \u201c How do you mean? \u201d he asked. \n \n The stranger shrugged and pursed out his lips. \u201c Well, \u201d he said broadly, \u201c having a hard time believing there \u2019 s a man up in the skies who watches over whether you \u2019 ll get a traffic ticket or not can be rather hard to give credence to once you \u2019 re an adult. But what about beyond that? \u201d \n \n \u201c You mean, like the afterlife? \u201d Brian asked. \n \n The stranger nodded. \u201c That \u2019 s one. \u201d He said. \u201c Or perhaps, the overall purpose of living. Of being. \u201d \n \n Brian gave a little nervous chuckle. \u201c Don \u2019 t you think that \u2019 s a little beyond my depths? I \u2019 m no philosopher. I barely passed my basic Ethics course in college. \u201d He tried to make light again but somehow he felt a weight pressing on him. Those moments he had in the middle of a shower or right at the edge of sleep, those moments of deep, unknowable darkness, began to creep into the corners of his body. \n \n \u201c But isn \u2019 t that what we \u2019 re doing? \u201d the man pressed. \u201c We \u2019 re working and creating a life in hopes that it \u2019 ll somehow illuminate us at the end, what it was all for. We do all these things in hopes that, at least on our deathbeds, we \u2019 ll know why we did it and where it \u2019 ll ultimately lead us. \u201d \n \n Brian stared at the stranger. The warm eyes never lost its friendly glow but somehow the face had grown longer and the lines around his eyes and mouth a little deeper, lending an air of gravity that was a little daunting. Brian sniffed, that odd pungent smell wafting in again. Had another car skidded out? \n \n \u201c What about you? \u201d Brian asked. \u201c Are you a religious man? \u201d \n \n The stranger stared at Brian for a beat before a slow spreading smile grew on his face. He looked amused. \n \n \u201c I think to some degree I am, \u201d he said. \n \n Brian coughed. The smell was really quite strong now. His eyes flicked around the quiet parking lot. Was something maybe burning somewhere? \n \n \u201c And you believe in God giving us life and heaven and hell and angels and Satan? \u201d Brian asked, a little incredulously. The man seemed so educated and refined. It was hard to believe he would really believe in something as ludicrous as demons and devils. \n \n The stranger didn \u2019 t answer right away. He instead gave Brian a long and studying gaze, as if debating whether he wanted to reply or not. And if he did reply, whether he wanted to be honest or not. And that rattled Brian for a moment. The stranger didn \u2019 t strike him as a liar. \n \n Finally the man sighed, shaking his head. \u201c I believe that sometimes cruelty can lie in the face of an angel, \u201d he said, leaning back into the hard metal seat. The man looked at the round table and the cold cup of coffee. He smiled to himself as if momentarily forgetting Brian was sitting next to him. \n \n \u201c Sometimes I wonder how fair it is to set up a world with just enough rules and clues as to how it operates. It \u2019 s like playing a game with every other word in the rulebook blacked out. You \u2019 ll never get the full story. And your chances of winning are just that\u2014chance. \u201d \n \n \u201c Huh? \u201d Brian asked, completely confused. \u201c I don \u2019 t think I understand. \u201d \n\n"}

The Extended Edition of Return of the King? A drive from London to Manchester? \n \n Had there ever before been a war that lasted four hours? James did n't think so. He'd heard about the war that lasted fifty-two minutes between Britain and Zanzibar, and he'd heard of the 365 year war between the isles of Scilly and Holland, but he doubted that there had ever been a four hour war before. \n \n And it had never destroyed the world before. \n \n He brought the binoculars up to his eyepieces. \n \n `` Look!'' he pointed across the plain and spoke into the radio. `` Oxford's almost untouched.'' \n \n `` They'll all be dead. If the blast did n't get them the fallout will have taken them by now,'' his companion, a stocky northerner did n't bother following where James was pointing. \n \n `` But think of all that's there! Libraries full of books! Computers! Engineering!'' James gasped. `` And there's three hospitals. MRI machines, X-ray machines, anti-biotics by the cart full.'' \n \n `` It's almost twenty miles away kid,'' the northerner growled. `` We need tinned food, and medicine that is n't irradiated too much.'' The northerner pointed to the stain of houses at the bottom of the hill. `` That village's food and medicine will keep us alive a lot longer than any number of books.'' \n \n `` If we're going to rebuild civilisation-'' \n \n `` We're not lad.'' The northerner picked up his bag and trudged over the fields towards the village. Around him the grass was dying. It was struggling hard, but large patches were turning brown, and some black. \n \n There was not a bird in the sky. Not an insect on the wing. The air was empty. \n \n `` Come on,'' the Northerner growled. `` Your radiation suit wo n't keep the fallout gone forever. The sooner we can fill these bags with food the sooner we can go back underground where its safe.'' \n \n `` I still think its a sign,'' James said defiantly. `` We scientists in the particle accelerator building were the only ones who survived. All over the world it will be the same, the scientists in the deep labs will be the ones who survived when all others perished. We can build a perfect utopia.'' \n \n `` Kid, there are fifty-eight of us men in the Diamond,'' the northerner just shook his head, making his radiation suit wobble. `` And there are only 13 women. Unless you want to do some real disgusting stuff the next generation is goin to be a lot smaller. And even if we force all the women to have six babies each, do you really think we can teach them all the stuff we know? WHat's going to matter to them is n't books or x-ray machines or the diamond light source particle accelerator. They'll worry about food.'' The northener paused. `` And other survivors.'' \n \n James paused in their walk. They were standing on the highest point of the Bag's Tree Hill. Now all the trees were dead and barren you could see almost twenty miles in every direction. \n \n `` You think there are?'' \n \n `` Britain had three hundred warheads,'' the northerner said. `` France had about the same. That's enough to hit every American city with a population greater than 100,000 people twice. But do you really think its enough to wipe out every american? California alone is the size of Britain and France combined lots of space to hide.'' The northerner looked up at the sky. `` And that does n't include the Russians, or the Chinese. And there's the countries we would n't have hit at all, Brazil, Australia, South Africa. I'm sure the fallout is killing them just as surely as its killing us,'' a gust of wind whipped past them and the Geiger counter briefly went into a Prestissimo cacophony. `` But they had time to get people to shelters. To get things prepared and one day, maybe not for years but one day, over that horizon,'' he pointed south, to the Continent. `` We'll see helicopters fly in under a foreign flag and we, or our children, will be forced to speak whatever oingo-boingo language they demand and pray to whatever oingo-boingo gods.'' \n \n `` You make it sound like we lost the war,'' James said. `` We wiped out New York, Chicago, Austin, Dallas, San Fransisco, LA-'' \n \n `` Everyone lost this war kid,'' the northerner just walked on. `` And if you ca n't see that you're as deluded as the people who started it.'' \n \n James just there and watched the Northerner head for the village. Wind rustled the dead tree branches and flicked away pieces of the decaying grass. \n \n James would never again be able to feel the wind on his face or the sun on his skin. James stood under the Bag's Tree for a long time. Above him, the living history of a thousand years slowly crumbled to dust.\n"}

At first I thought it was just me but I've come to find out that everyone around me has been changing and it's become more and more noticeable. Everyone's personalities seem to have changed. My parents who were known to be early sleepers now stay up at ungodly hours and are somehow always awake before I am. Even my friends have taken up some out of character hobbies. Hell even my neighbors seem to have changed. As I roll out of my bed I ca n't help by wonder why it's become so more noticeable now than before. \n \n Today was yet another boring monday school day. I was in my senior year of high school. I was at best a C average type of student. I did n't find school all that challenging, just boring and repetitive. I had a few friends, not to many but we were a pretty close klick. The school itself was pretty old and was located on the outskirts of the town. I did n't know how to drive and I despised taking the bus so I often just car pooled with my friend David and his brother Tim. \n \n I walk down the stairs and see my parents sitting together on the couch watching the TV. It appears they pulled another all nighter again, their clothes and hair are a mess. \n \n `` Ah good morning son! Off to school?'' asks my Dad \n \n `` Yeah, David is picking me up like usual... Hey I got ta ask, why do guys stay up so late all the time now?'' \n \n My mom and dad look at each other before turning to me to answer \n \n `` Well as you know I've lost a lot of weight lately and I've been having some hunger issues. Your father found this all you can eat 24\/7 place down the road and we have been hitting it up late at night.'' answers my mother. \n \n My mother did look a bit thin and it would explain all the leftovers in the fridge lately. \n \n `` Yeah its real great! All the food is nice and fresh. Maybe you can come with us sometime, I'm sure you would enjoy it!'' says my father. \n \n `` Eh I'll think about it, well I got ta get going. See ya!'' \n \n I walk out the door and head down to the corner of street where David picks me up. Along the way I notice my neighbors walking around once again. Whats strange is not only the usual number of them doing so its that they all seemed to start at the same time. \n \n `` Geeze, when did everyone become so health conscious?'' I just shrug it off. \n \n I look down the street and spot Davids car. It was an old beat up piece of junk and looked like it been through hell and back but at least it got us to point a to point b. David pulls up beside the curb and I hop in and we drive off. \n \n `` What's up dude? Sleep well?'' asks David \n \n `` Yeah kinda, parents been acting strange lately. I found out they been doing midnight chow runs at some place down the road.'' \n \n `` Oh I know just the place I've been there a few times myself'' says a voice sitting behind us. \n \n I turn my head and see Tim, David's younger brother. \n \n `` Well is it any good?'' I ask. \n \n `` Eh pretty good, kinda have to work to get it but its worth the effort. The crowds there can be a bit crazy at times. It's kinda become the new hotness lately.'' Tim replies. \n \n I sudden smell an awful smell. It assaulted my senses like a bolt of lightning setting my nose on fire. \n \n `` Ack, when was the last time you bathed Tim? You smell awful..'' \n \n Tim stares back in embarrassment \n \n `` Just the other day! Get off my case!'' Tim retorts. \n \n David lets out a good laugh \n \n `` Our parents say its puberty but we all know the real reason. Tim has n't bathed in days. He is afraid of water.'' jokes David \n \n `` I AM NOT! `` shouts Tim in protest. \n \n `` It's just.. It's just that I do n't like the soap! It tears up my skin all the time!'' \n \n `` Well maybe you should n't scrub so hard then, you will end up peeling all of it off'' I answer. \n \n `` Anyhow, David have you been noticing anything weird lately?'' I ask \n \n `` Other than my stinkface brothers smell lately, no I have n't. Why you ask?'' David replies. \n \n `` I dunno it's stupid, but people seem to have changed suddenly.'' \n \n `` Its probably just because of all this fog we have been having lately. It has n't been giving up since the last few days. Maybe its just affecting everyone's mood?'' Tim says boastingly. \n \n `` Yeah... maybe..Its just all in my mind maybe..'' \n \n `` In that brainless skull of yours? I did n't think you had that much of an imagination.'' David jokes again \n \n `` Yeah sure, whatever rot brain. Let just see how well you do on your test today before you pass judgement on me'' I retort. \n \n `` Shit, I totally forgot. God damn Mr.Lander's giving us stupid history tests on crap that's always constantly changing. I wish that old bag of bones would just get a life!'' \n \n Me and Tim laugh at David's crappy situation. As we travel down the road the fog starts to roll in pretty heavy and our vision starts to go down. The road is flanked by the creepy silhouettes of the old barren oak trees. \n \n `` Shit I can barely see now with all this freaking fog'' David says as he stares hard at the dark road before us. \n \n `` Just drive slow, there is no rush. Its not like I'm in hurry to get to class. Besides there is hardly any traffic on the road anyhow'' I say. \n \n `` True that, fuck that test man. I do n't even wan --'' David is suddenly cut off. \n \n A large tree branch drops in front of us and David slams on the brakes hard nearly avoiding hitting it. \n \n `` JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!'' Shouts David \n \n `` Is everyone ok?'' I ask \n \n `` Yeah... I'm fine.. though it feels I almost got my head ripped off.'' Replies Tim. \n \n The tree branch is pretty huge and blocks the entire road. \n \n `` Well this is the only way to the school, guess we have to move it'' \n \n `` Great, just my luck. A study test and I nearly get killed by a stupid tree..ALL IN THE SAME DAY'' David shouts. \n \n We all get out of the car and walk towards the branch. The fog surrounds us and is thick and heavy. Barely any light can get through. David bends down and starts to try to lift the branch out of the way. \n \n `` Are you sure you can lift it? It looks rather heavy'' says a considered Tim. \n \n `` Yeah I'm sure! I'm not some kind of weakling Tim..Now stand back. I do n't want you to get hurt'' David responds. \n \n David bends down to lift the heavy log, grasping it with a tight grip with his lanky long arms. At first he seems to lift the log with ease but is only getting it a few inches off the ground. He begins to groan as he struggles to lift the log. \n \n `` Are you sure you do n't want some help? It's no troub-'' Tim is cut off by David \n \n `` OF COURSE I'M SURE! NOW SHUT UP!'' Shouts David. \n \n He gives one final tug and suddenly something snaps. \n \n David's left arm plops to the floor with a loud thud as we both just stare at him in dead silence. \n \n `` Dangit! Now i got ta get a new one!'' says David now staring at the socket where his arm was once connected to. \n \n I let out a sigh of disappointment. \n \n `` Come on ya rotting old fool, lets go get ya a new one at the graveyard..'' \n \n `` Great just freaking great! Now I lose an arm, have a test, nearly die to tree branch and I'm going to be late.'' David says angrily. \n \n `` There are some shovels back at my house lets head on back.'' \n \n `` Hey since we are going to be late can we get something to eat? I'm starving'' asks Tim. \n \n `` I'm sure my mom and dad have some leftover brains in the fridge.

John Baker still held his gaze at me, with folded arms. I tried to squeeze out a glib remark. \n \n \n `` It's such a shame. Thirty two years of age, succumbing to a rare form of tuberculosis. Nearly as old as Jesus.'' \n \n \n A worried smile crossed my face. `` Well, had to beat Jesus at *something*.'' \n \n \n Nodding, Death straightened his tie again. `` I will be seeing you soon, Mr. Malloy.'' \n \n \n Walking away, he handed a card to John Baker at the back as he walked out. The bar seemed very, very small suddenly. The intermission was over, as drunken louts came back to their seats. Loaded with beer, wine and whatever was cheap, they geared up for a hell of a performance. \n \n \n The rest of the set bombed. \n \n \n When the set was done, short of being thrown out, I hunched my shoulders against the cold winter night. Leaving through the side door, I hustled my way to the alley trying to avoid the crowd. *Terrific*, I thought to myself. *Death comes for those who die from a bad joke. * \n \n \n Making my way onto the main street, I realized I had no money to catch the bus. It was a three mile walk, at least an hour away. I was tired, cold and most importantly, scared. My coat was too thin, my jokes were too bad and time was too short. \n \n \n `` Speaking of the Devil, there you are.'' Death said, rather surprised. `` Are you ready to come along?'' \n \n \n He gestured to the middle of the road, as if to make a point. The pits of his eyes turned jet black, the whites of his eyes being swallowed into nothing. \n \n \n `` How about a knock knock joke?'' I muttered. \n \n \n Death tilted his head, shaking. \n \n \n `` How about this?'' I glanced up. `` Why did the chicken cross the road?'' \n \n \n Death squinted what was left of his eyes. \n \n \n `` You would know, you talked to him last.'' \n \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The man who found the cure for AIDS is being interviewed on live television . The interviewer is slowly realizing this man does n't understand ethical medical practices .\n","story":"'So, please welcome my next guest, Dr. Andrew Reynolds!' \n \n The applause from the audience thundered as a thin man walked out into the studio. He wore glasses and had a well-tailored suit. His hair was gelled up into spikes. He looked to be in his mid-twenties, which made his achievement all the more special. \n \n For Reynolds had done something amazing. He had cured AIDS. \n \n It had made the news for the entire week since the announcement. Several companies were already mass-producing the cure and thousands of victims were already being treated. There were no side-effects, it was cheap and easy to make, and protected a person for life. \n \n Of course, Reynolds became a global celebrity overnight. He was constantly being asked to appear on news programmes, interviews, radio shows, magazines, newspapers, you name it. Everyone wanted to talk to the man who had defeated one of the most stubborn conditions known to man. But he had n't accepted any of their offers. Until tonight. \n \n The host of this particular talk show was Richard Carlton, one of America's best-loved hosts. His good humour, insightful comments and interesting questions made for excellent entertainment. Everyone had been looking forward to tonight's show. \n \n'Hello, Andy - is it alright if I call you Andy? Please, do sit down.' \n \n'Thank you, Richard,' said Reynolds politely, easing himself down onto the couch.'It's great to be here. Really great.' \n \n'It's great to have you here, Andy,' replied Richard, smiling.'So, I'm going to cut straight to the chase. How did you cure the seemingly incurable disease that is AIDS?' \n \n'Well,' began Reynolds, sitting back.'It all began about two years ago. I was doing research into aggressive viruses and how they could possibly be harnessed to fight proper diseases. Basically, my idea was to fight fire with fire.' \n \n He smiled.'Of course, it was n't simply a case of creating the opposite to AIDS. I had to make sure that the two would cancel each other out, not rip apart the person in the process. The artificial viruses I created were made to recognise the human body and work around it whilst fighting the AIDS virus. Otherwise it would be more a case of slash-and-burn.' \n \n'So did that work? How did you test it?' said Richard, leaning forwards. \n \n'It was difficult at first,' said Reynolds, adjusting his glasses.'The main problem was that the anti-AIDS viruses could n't be tested in anything other than a human, since they were only able to recognise human DNA. Even chimpanzees did n't work. They just died soon after the injection. No, it had to be a human subject.' \n \n Richard blinked a few times before collecting himself.'You mean, you had a volunteer to be injected with AIDS?' \n \n'No, no, of course not!' laughed Reynolds.'I knew that such trials were made illegal, but we have to make sacrifices in the name of progress, do n't we?' \n \n'Then who did you test the cure on?' said Richard. His brow was beginning to shine with sweat under the studio lights. \n \n'An assistant of mine,' replied Reynolds.'Her name is Cassandra Phillips, or Cassie, as she likes to be called. I brought her into the lab one day, sedated her, and administered the first test cure along with the AIDs sample.' \n \n Richard swallowed and glanced at the cameras. He smiled nervously.'So where is she now? How did she react?' \n \n Reynolds crossed his legs and shook his head with a small smile.'Obviously I could n't let her go before the tests were done. What if the sample did n't work and she had transferred the disease? No, I kept her in a specially constructed observation room. It allowed me to study the effects more easily.' \n \n Richard glanced down at his notes, feeling sick. This man was obviously quite mad.'You do realise that's unethical, do n't you?' \n \n'Unethical!' exclaimed Reynolds.'Ethics must be thrown aside if we are to defeat these diseases! Take autonomy, for example. A patient has the right to accept or refuse their treatment. And look where that has gotten us. Parents refusing to give their children vaccines because they think it'll cause autism, allowing things like measles to spread across the States! It's madness. If we made sure every last person was vaccinated against measles, it would be gone once and for all!' \n \n He lowered his voice a little.'So that's why I had to do it, you see. By ignoring medical ethics one time, I have cured AIDS. Think how easy it will be to take on something like cancer if we ignore things like that. Autonomy - out the window. Doing a patient no harm is one I would rather not break, but if it requires sacrificing the one to help the many, I would do so in a heartbeat!' \n \n'But Ms. Phillips,' protested Richard.'Where is she now?' \n \n'Still in my lab,' drawled Reynolds.'Once the AIDS virus worked, I thought I might as well keep her for other tests. No sense in wasting a good testing ground, is there?' \n \n'I'm sorry, but you do n't seem to understand ethical medical practices at all,' said Richard.'Even if you have cured AIDS, you have violated a person's rights as a patient and your responsibilities as a medical practitioner.' He looked to one of the crew.'Get the police in here now! And someone find Ms. Phillips immediately!' \n \n'Scared of the truth, Carlton?' sneered Reynolds.'Let me ask you something. If you knew you could cure all worldly diseases by making one person suffer for a few years, would you do it? I did, and look at the result. We now have a cure for AIDS, and soon I shall make the same breakthrough with cancer as well. And all it will take is the sacrifice of a tiny portion of the rules we have put in place around ourselves.' \n \n He stood up and turned to the cameras, arms raised. \n \n'It is only by breaking the rules that we can break the deadlock!' he proclaimed, eyes bulging.'I am a man of medicine, and I was taught that it was wrong to break the moral code! But see what happened when I did! And I will not rest until every last disease in the world is defeated! Even if it means the suffering of a few people, I am working for the greater good!' \n \n At that moment, six burly police officers barged into the studio and grabbed Reynolds by the arms. He was dragged bodily from in front of the cameras. They turned to see him being pulled through the main doors. As he disappeared from view, everyone could hear him shouting. \n \n'I regret nothing!' he yelled.'You should all thank me for what I did! For the greater goo-' The closing doors cut off his last word. \n \n Richard cleared his throat as the cameras turned back to him. He smiled hesitantly. \n \n'Go to commercials?'\n"}

When Europeans first come to the new world they also tell tales of a new object in the sky . ( x-post from \/r\/space )\n","story":"I'd been told of the sky-orb of the New World, but I had never seen it myself. That is, until I made my voyage. The first night, it was but a sliver in the sky. But it grew. Each night, as I looked back up to chart my position on my map, the sliver got just a bit wider. Wider and wider it grew until it became a full circle. \n \n A majestic circle. It was a muted tone of grey, matching the mood of the other sailors with me. Except this grey was a beautiful grey. Words truly do not do the object justice. The colour was inspiring. Not just a plain colour either. It had discolourations that somehow made it seem even more beautiful. Having more features than the sun, but not nearly as bright made it easy to look at. \n \n For seemingly the whole night, the crew and I would just stare at this beautiful orb. Nothing like this existed back in Europe. In fact, that was the tales of such beauty that first inspired me to take this offer of exploration. That and fame. And money. And adventure. During the day, I would muse about how this object came to be and why it appeared only in the New World. But I dared not discuss it with the other crew members. None of them would understand anyway. \n \n Heading on a westerly route in the North Atlantic was a difficult task. The days were cold. The nights colder. The food was atrocious, to make no mention of any other amenities. Our mission was quite simple. Find a route to Cathay. Not very hard, considering that everyone knew a route had to exist somewhere between the Atlantic and the Pacific. We just had to find it. \n \n They told me to go through the Russian Arctic and to the Pacific. But they did n't tell me that there would be ice. So I turned around and headed back west. There was a path through the New World, for sure. I was confident. Alas, I went on a course too far south. I ended up landing on the east coast of the New World, instead of going through it. I headed back home to report what I had found, and also to hopefully get another chance to explore. \n \n Using the pretense of finding the Northwest Passage, I convinced the English to let me sail forth again for the New World. My excitement for exploration was only surpassed by my love for the orb in the sky. The second trip, I spent more of my time watching the moon, as it was now termed. My route was more northerly this time, which allowed longer nights and more time with this dazzling night light. \n \n Upon passing Greenland, my crew got more excited at the prospect of having found a passage. At this point, I was all but consumed with the sight of the circle in the sky. I could no longer stand the nights where the circle was reduced to a small crescent or even entirely taken away. My navigation of the increasingly cold waters took a toll, as I was spending too much time at night wondering about the moon. \n \n I explored the coast of a bay, but eventually the waters got too cold. In fact, it was n't even water any more. It was ice. Our ship was trapped. We moved ashore to spend the winter and prepare for the next year when we could explore more of the coast and find a passage. Without my knowledge, most of my crew decided to sail back to England. I would not let them. I pleaded them to reason with me. Our mission was to find a passage to Cathay, and we had n't accomplished that. What I did not tell them was that along with wanting to find a passage, I wanted to spend more time with the moon. My life back in Europe would not be complete with such a dark and empty spot in the sky. \n \n The crew was very adamant about not continuing. I was very adamant about not returning. The situation boiled over when my crew mutinied. They sent me adrift in a rowboat and sailed back. I was left to die. But not alone. I had my crew, my son, and most importantly, my moon. \n \n -Henry Hudson \n \n **** \n \n Henry Hudson was an explorer, as the story says, who was set adrift by his crew.

A quick showdown. \n \n Two seconds earlier and the red car on the street would have had time to stop. Two seconds later and the man in the jeans would have seen the red car and therefore almost certainly not have walked into it. \n \n As it is though, he walked right into the path of it. The wally. \n \n So there was nothing for it, she could n't just sit there and watch him die now could she? You got a few powers as a member of the Interdimensional Guarding Angels, one of which was the ability to slow time down to a stretch. In human terms anyway. In reality she need only plod slightly more methodically over the fabric of space time. She was a little drunk however. It was n't really supposed to be used except in emergencies. \n \n Well this was an emergency dammit! Frenetically she stuffed a bunch of paper with little hearts dotted around the margins into her satchel and swung it over her shoulder. She downed the rest of the bottle of glowing liquid and dropped it onto the pavement where it did not so much smash as effervesce into nothingness. \n \n Time slowed. Kind of. \n \n She ran over to him, as the background behind her stayed frozen in almost perfect stillness. If one looked closely you would see a man dropping his armful of fruit as if suspended in treacle. A womans face scrunches slowly into a grotesque fashion as a car wheel going too fast sprays her with a heavy misting of puddle water. One might briefly inquire as to the originality of God for a moment, or if he is fond of cliches. \n \n She runs in a wobbly line towards the man in jeans and snatches him off the road mid stride. It may be worth noting now that she looks a lot like a slim blonde woman, of the shorter stature. Her hair is cropped and slightly askew. Her eyes are burning with a fire that seems to overpower her brain. This was a problem. She forgot about inertia. \n \n Inertia is the measurable amount that something at rest does n't want to go really fast. That was what she had written in her textbook in Abilties class. It was important. She remembered that much. She wrapped her little arms that concealed a whole dimension of strength gently around his waist and picked him up off the tarmac. She heard a loud low noise rumbling slowly outwards from the center of his torso. Then she remembered why it was important. It was the sound of his spleen exploding as he went from a walking pace to an equivalent speed of 85mph in 0.23 seconds. She looks up at his face, still frozen in normality, the electric signals which are inching their way up his spine to his brain wo n't arrive for several seconds yet. He's so handsome, she thinks to herself. I just wanted to help him. Maybe strike up a conversation about that book he was reading last week. She'd finished it now. She knows she could make him smile. \n \n She stops at an alley and lets time flow normally around her, he continues at a brisk eighty miles an hour into a pile of garbage and a wire fence. She gasps a little too loudly. The man whose jeans are now somewhere else lies in a pile of newspaper and weird smelling liquids. He is quite clearly dying. \n \n `` Shit.'' She looks worried. \n \n There is a flash. A man appears inside of it. \n \n The dying man groans at the bright light burning in his eyelids. `` Whaat happeend?'' \n \n `` Stay away from the light Matt!'' The guardian girl shouts out, wobbling ever more outside of uprightness. \n \n `` Liiite?'' Matt passes out. \n \n `` Angel 29C3? `` The new man is wearing a suit and holds a clipboard under his arm. He looks annoyed. \n \n `` Oh, hi boss.'' She turns around meekly. \n \n `` Do n't call me that.'' He snaps. He looks around and sees the bleeding human in the garbage. `` Are you serious? This again?''. He visibly deflates. \n \n `` I did n't mean to hurt him!'' \n \n He sighs `` Give me the card 29C3.'' \n \n `` He was going to be hit by a car! I mean that's what we're supposed to do right? Guard people?'' Her arms wave around. \n \n `` Just give me the card, this is not the first time. You'll report for ten years retraining tomorrow in the home dimension at 0900 hours sharp.'' \n \n `` But..'' \n \n `` Now. Unless you want me to make it twenty years?'' \n \n `` B-'' She catches herself and shuffles around inside her satchel petulantly. She finds the card and hands it to the man, hand trembling slightly. \n \n The man looks at it, the name of the human, the relevant details of his life, his true love, his greatest fears, whether he is a dog person or a cat person. He looks long and hard at the hearts drawn around his picture to make a border. He sighs. \n \n Without looking up he continues. `` I'll have the time crew come in a few hours ago and clean this mess up.'' There's a pause. `` This is n't his end date, so I'm sure he'll recover from the car crash.'' He says with a touch more emotion. He sweeps the card into the clipboard and stiffens up. \n \n They stand in silence for a moment. Matt coughs blood erratically. \n \n `` I'm not your boss you know.'' He kicks the ground at his feet. \n \n `` Oh, boss. Sorry. I mean, I never thought.'' \n \n `` Right. Of course not. It was a stupid thing to say.'' He turns swiftly on his heels as if to leave. \n \n `` Wait, I mean I never thought you were interested.'' She blushes. \n \n `` Oh. OH. Right. Well.'' He seems unsure, as if this was uncharted territory. \n \n `` Yeah. Well..'' \n \n The man seems to find some inner strength `` I guess a, erm, a drink tomorrow? When you get off retraining?'' \n \n `` That would be wonderful!'' She's beaming. Still drunk. \n \n `` Great! I mean ok. Right. Wonderful. I'll pick you up at yours then.'' Before waiting for an answer he flicks out his small pocket device. Presses a few buttons and disappears in a flash of light. As if afraid she would change her mind if he stuck around for too long. \n \n The girl relaxes slightly and audibly coos as she shuffles up to the crumpled body of Matt conspiratorially. As if she's telling him the biggest secret in the world. \n \n `` We would have been good Matt, I know we would. But I've got to go away for a while, and me and the boss are a better fit. Biologically speaking. You know? I'm sorry Matt but you're a wonderful guy. Amazing really. I'm sure you'll find a nice nurse after your car accident or something. Someone else will take my shifts so we wo n't see each other anymore, not that you could ever see me.'' \n \n She places a soft kiss on his broken face before standing up and taking out her own device, pressing some numbers, giving a little `` woo!'' and a fist pump before flashing out of existence. \n \n `` Whyyy...?'' Gurgled Matt. He tries to move but finds it causes him an incredible amount of pain everywhere. He's sure that nearly all his bones are broken. Pieces of the last minute crash through his brain. He feels very confused. \n \n Suddenly he feels a slight tingle, radiating out from his center. He imagines he is dying. He is grateful. \n \n In an explosion of movement, like an escalator suddenly moving while you have been walking up it, entirely expecting it not to move. Matt is rushed back onto the street, his arms and legs and spleen all where they should be. He pauses for a second, but not two, feeling a little put out. Begrudgingly he continues down into the street and tries to walk off the weird feeling something terrible has happened. Weird. He did n't drink last night. \n \n Then the red car hits him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

She knew he was. \u201c Brother! \u201d she cried. The wind twisted and muted her words, throwing them back at her with a flurry of blown sand. \n \n The tribe had been camped here for several days, taking shelter beneath an ancient, tumbled structure of strange bleached stone. They were fleeing the Wave, an ever-growing dune that spanned the horizons, as they had done for years, as far back as Shel \u2019 ia could remember. Move camp, scavenge for\u2026 anything, then move again as the Wave crept closer. Her brother was the latest in an unending line of scouts, sent into the desert on all sides, searching for an end to their flight. \n \n At first the scouts had returned with promises, glimpses of blue sky and clear earth, some had even seen the ocean, whatever that was. But as time went on the scouts found less and less, until all they reported was sand, only sand. Their hopes faded, and they trudged ever onward, always one step ahead of the encroaching Wave. And then, one day the scouts had stopped returning. \n \n \u201c Brother! \u201d Shel \u2019 ia cried again. It was hopeless in this wind, she knew, but she had to try. Sand stung her cheeks, bit at her hands, whirled around her in an impermeable cyclone. \n \n Her foot caught a rock and Shel \u2019 ia tumbled to the earth, her scarf catching the wind and flying into the unknown. Sand filler her mouth, her nose, her eyes. She rolled into a protective ball, spitting and coughing. \n \n The wind ripped over her, wailing, screaming. Her mother \u2019 s voice was gone. She looked back the way she had come, but there was only the omnipresent wall of sand. Or was that the way... Her heart jumped into her throat. Which way had she come? All she could see were the leading tendrils of the Wave. \n \n A strong hand grasped Shel \u2019 ia by the collar and hoisted her to her feet. Heart racing, she looked up to see a bug-eyed monster standing over her. Her father had told her stories of the Sand Monsters that lived on the Wave and feasted on anything caught in its wake. That was before he had disappeared, like so many of the village \u2019 s men before him. She screamed, but her voice was lost to the wind. \n \n The monster reached for her, and she shied away, tears leaving little rivers down her sand-covered cheeks. The thing cocked its head, shrugged, then let her go, and Shel \u2019 ia stumbled back, fumbling at her belt for the dagger her brother had given her. \n \n But then the monster reached up and removed its eyes, and it was her brother, beaming from beneath a tangle of scarf. He looked thinner then she had remembered, and he had deep bags beneath his eyes, but it was her brother. She raced forward and hugged him as tightly as she could. \n \n \u201c Shel \u2019 ia! Why are you out here alone? \u201d His voice sounded thin against the gale, and she fumbled over a response.

Now let \u2019 s get home, there \u2019 s nothing out here to see. \u201d \n \n Hand in hand, the two trudged through the sand with the wind at their backs. Shel \u2019 ia drank deeply from the waterskin. Her brother was saying something that she could not hear over the wind. \n \n Finally, like a phantom the village emerged from the sand. The two made their way to their mother \u2019 s tent and pushed through the flap. \n \n Inside the tent was a whole different world. The wind still howled, but it was muffled by the stretched and dried animal skin. The floor was sand, but was covered in old threadbare carpets.

They had had sex and the dude was n't ashamed to let people know that. Suddenly a bunch of decidedly non-hunky, non-sexy dudes burst in with machine guns and shot the sexy woman to death. `` What the hell, dudes?'' said the sexy dude. The non-sexy dudes said, `` You are just too sexy and we are hella mad jelly lol.'' The sexy dude thought it was weird that someone would say lol out loud. They continued, `` Ever since you stole the Solarian Archive and summoned the dark god Su-LuNi back into the netherverse you have become even more incredibly sexy.'' `` Oh shit,'' said the sexy dude, `` did I do that?'' He did the characteristic Urkel face but nobody got the joke because it was 2245 AD and family no longer mattered in the post-cybercolonialist era. \n \n `` Let's try and be civil about this,'' said the sexy dude. Some very mysterious and uncomfirmable things were going on in the background but he had no way to confirm those. `` There's no way your bullets could destroy my rock hard abs or even pierce my magnetic aura of sexual tension.'' The non-sexy dudes grimaced. `` That may be true, but you know what happened last week and the week before and these things that happened alter the meaning of your statement without altering the actual statement in the same way that judicial review can alter the spirit of the law without altering the letter of the law.'' The sexy dude was taken aback by this unnecessary comparison. `` Whatever, dude. All that stuff is in the past. Nobody can possibly know what happened there unless they expeienced it themselves, which I did, but others did not, hence the situation we are in right now, which is typical of humanity as we have individual memories and are not some kind of hivemind or machine cloud intellgience that shares a single consciousness.'' The unsexy dudes had passed their loquacious ways to our intrepid hero and he shuddered at the thought of wasting so much ink if his words were to be printed. After all, ink had just become a serious problem within society for reasons that are slightly arduous to explain. \n \n It seemed the dudes had reached a standstill in their conversation. The unsexy dudes were becoming increasingly unsexy by the moment as they increasingly smelt of desperation and cringe. The sexy dude replied by saying, `` I'd love to stay and chat, but really, I would n't love that at all. It was sarcastic. Anyway, I have to go now. See you next week on The Further Adventures of Barack Obama in the Post-Cybercolonialist Age.''\n"}

I can still pick out a pedestrian across the street and tell you if he has a cold or hay fever\u2014the nuance lies in the level of resignation in his red-rimmed, watery eyes. \n \n A man with a cold feels as if the ache behind his eyes, the skin rubbed raw around his nose is slowly killing him. He feels sluggish, half of his usual self. A man with allergies is done dealing with self-pity and symptoms. He feels ill, but he feels whole. \n \n Stephie always said that the discomfort of a perpetual runny nose pales in comparison to the dark occasions she jolts into consciousness unable to draw in breath.

Just do n't get caught*, I said to myself, counting the number of steps in my head. 36. 36 steps until I reach her door. It was plenty dark and there were no Suits on the street. Easy. Just like it always is. \n \n I craned my neck up to see past the window's frame, to look up at the night sky. There was always some sort of glare on the dome overhead. It was distracting. The metal beams that acted as scaffolding for the glass also did a great job of blocking out the moon. This was a blessing and a curse. You barely ever saw the moon anymore. When you did, it was like looking through a waffle iron. But it made the street even darker than it ought to be, so I did n't complain. \n \n *Deep breath* \n \n After a sharp inhale, I opened my door and stepped outside. I do n't think i'll ever get used to the feeling in the air ( or lack thereof ) after curfew. It was an unsettling stillness that muffled sounds and made you feel alone, even if you really were n't. \n \n Tonight, I was most certainly not alone. \n \n By the time I made it to the hedges at the end of my driveway, I noticed a flash of light out of the corner of my eye, which sent me skidding to my ass behind the mailbox. I perched up on the balls of my feet and peeked through the leaves towards where the flsah had come from.

Suits. * \n \n Suits, or CEAs, were Curfew Enforcement Agents. They made sure that no one was sneaking out late at night after the government enforced curfew. You'd think, with the lack of oxygen, it would be completely unnecessary, but people still had access to O2 tanks these days. CEAs always wore these ugly ass yellow suits that acted as space suits, in a way. The oxygen tanks on their backs were a shiny chrome and a dead giveaway. Not very stealthy. But with semi-automatic rifles at their hips, they could afford lack of stealth. \n \n This observation took a total of.7 seconds, just enough time for my heart rate to increase, making my blood-oxygen level drop dramatically. I had to make a decision and fast. \n \n I rolled back on my heels and sat down on the grass. He had n't seen me. His back was to me, which is why the glare from his O2 wank was so bright. I could either go back inside or risk crossing the street. \n \n At that exact moment, the Suit turned in my direction and began walking.\n"}

Rumours have been flying in the house about who the Eldritch being is, and Juliana is hearing accusations from every one of the guys. Why do n't we check in with the privacy camera to see what some of our guys are saying about the current situation? \n \n _____________________________________________________ \n \n Eric sat in the confessional room, looking around nervously and waiting for someone to turn on the camera. He kept adjusting his tie, a deep red against his white dress shirt. He'd worn one on the second week and it had become his thing. They all were told that the ratings did n't affect how Juliana chose, but he knew that this was a lie, all the dating shows kept the people who were popular on until the end. Hero and villain and all of that. Seeing as he was n't Toby of Elijah, he needed to settle for'the guy who dresses up nice for her.' \n \n The red light came on, signaling that he was good to vent whenever, he adjusted the tie again, checking his reflection in the lens. They'd fix him up in post, but he still wanted to look as good as he could for the cameras, he started talking, `` So, I do n't want to be the guy that's pointing fingers, but I'm pretty sure that I've figured out that the Eldritch abomination is Elijah,'' he was lying through his teeth, but he knew that people wanted the abomination to get off the show so it was a power play, `` I know we do n't have cameras in the bedrooms, but heard some really strange sounds coming from there, like maybe a portal opening, I do n't know.'' \n \n He continued for a while but figured everything else would end up on the cutting room floor, he just needed to make sure that everyone in the editing room thought that it was a legitimate session of letting off steam rather than just an accusation, or they would cut it to look pretty nasty, which was the last thing that he needed. \n \n He smiled one last time at the camera as the light faded away, leaving him alone in the confessions room again. There was a knock at the door, the softspoken Annie was on the other side. Network had tried to add a second extra element by having a girl in the mix, but Juliana only kinda swung that way if you gave her four shots of tequila and punched her in the face a few times. Producers did n't like the black eyes that left her with, so they left it at that, with every date Annie was on being horrendously anticlimactic. \n \n Huge hit with the boyfriends forced to watch the show though, so she was still in the competition. \n \n The short redhead slipped past Eric into the room, looking at the camera and waiting for the light to turn red, she'd just come back from an outing that included her and Andy, and boy did things get interesting. \n \n __________________________________________________________ \n \n `` Ca n't I just tell them now?'' Juliana said into Andy's shoulder, they'd stayed back on the yacht that was rented for the day, `` they can rig the show or something.'' \n \n `` I do n't think that's how it works. You control the relics, how about we just play it safe, it's not like I'm going to lose.'' \n \n `` I do n't want to go on dates with other guys when I've already decided on you.'' \n \n `` I do n't know, Annie is nice.'' \n \n `` Oh come off it, I ca n't spend all my life experimentally drunk.'' \n \n `` I mean, you could.'' \n \n `` I'm not going to.'' \n \n `` What if I was the Eldritch Abomination?'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` What if?'' He posed the question while grabbing her chin to force her to face him, `` What if I were eight feet tall and an elder god?'' \n \n `` You'd be a short elder god.'' \n \n `` You think a god ca n't control his height?'' \n \n `` So you do n't think it's Annie?'' \n \n `` They did n't say Elder Goddess.'' \n \n `` Fiar enough.'' \n \n `` Would you care?'' \n \n `` At least a little,'' she said, now pulling away from the snuggle to watch the sunset, leaning back in her deck-chair, `` I mean, it would change things up in the bedroom,'' she lifted her large sunglasses off her eyes, `` which is how I know it is n't you.'' \n \n `` Good or bad?'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` In a good way or a bad way?'' \n \n `` I do n't know.'' \n \n `` Come on, you have google,'' Andy knocked her on the shoulder, pretty much the first thing that happened when the realms were connected was someone taking a camera and telling a being from each side to get it on. \n \n `` Alright, alright, it's weird but fine. So neutral I guess.'' \n \n Andy silently fist pumped, it was still going to be work to get them to accept that she was in love with his eldritch self, but the first thing he needed to do was get her on board. \n\n"}

He was tall, buff, and handsome, and besides his gorgeousness, he was the kindest gentleman she had ever had. He was new in town, but Amelia felt as though they had been together forever. He had his own house too, which was pretty awesome. Amelia had helped him move in. Beds and tables and chairs, rugs and blankets and clothes. He had so much stuff! Amelia visited him daily for hours at a time; sometimes she visted him more than once a day! But today, Amelia had gone to Richard's house to find him gone. Nothing had been distrubed, but no matter where she looked, Amelia could not find Richard. She went to her sister, Natalie, to see if she had seen Richard; it was a small population after all. When Amelia went into Natalie's room, she stopped, dumbfounded. There, sitting on the floor with Natalie was Richard. Furious, Amelia demanded, \n \n `` Why did you take him? He's mine!'' \n \n Natalie quickly stood up, and retorted, \n \n `` He's not *yours*,'' she said, `` Finders keepers, losers weepers.'' \n \n `` But he's mine!'' Amelia cried, tears rolling down her cheeks. She looked at Richard, sitting there as handsome as could be, but not saying anything. Amelia stood there, staring deeply into her sister's eyes, trying to understand why Natalie had taken Richard away from her. \n \n `` Natalie,'' she pleaded, `` Please give him back!''

At first , everything seems fine , even awesome . Until his randomly generated superpowers started to conflict with each other ...\n","story":"When Bill awakes, it is already afternoon, as Bill frequently likes to sleep in. The day feels like any other depressing Wednesday, but Bill doesn \u2019 t have much time left to spend at home, as he plans to meet up with his old friends to play soccer this evening. After finishing up his meal, Bill takes his old, worn out soccer shoes as well as his favorite soccer ball and heads out the door. \n \n Celebrating a happy reunion with his friends, Bill urges them to start the game already, as he had grown quite impatient from all the waiting. Through a quick round of rock-paper-scissors the men decide on Bill to play goalkeeper for the day. The two teams of three get ready, with one player of each team setting their sight on the ball. With a powerful kick, one of the men starts the match. After a short series of passes, the first attempt at scoring is made by one of the players. Bill braces himself for the impact of the ball and tries to block it. But before the leather can reach his hands, the ball suddenly changes direction mid air and flies off to the side. Baffled about what Bill had just done, the men all stare at him. Bill is just as confused as they are. \n \n The game continues for half an hour, with Bill reflecting every shot the players make. When asked for an explanation by his friends, Bill does not know what to say. How did he do that? Was he suddenly granted superhuman powers? Bill has no idea how or why he can do that, but he doesn \u2019 t dislike the thought of being able to curve projectiles. This same evening, Bill spends some time playing around with objects lying around the house. For some reason, Bill can change the trajectory of any projectile in mid air now. With a confused look in his eyes, Bill finds this power to be incredibly useful and ends the day there. \n \n The next day has Bill wake up to a giant snow storm. Bill can not believe his own eyes when he sees this, as it is the middle of August and he lives in a very warm region. Taking the events of the day prior in consideration, Bill wonders if he can also control the weather now. First thing in the day, Bill gets up and walks outside to try and change the weather back to sunny. However, even after trying for ten full minutes, Bill can not do anything to further influence the weather. Maybe someone else in the town has got superpowers as well, Bill thinks to himself. It would be possible; after all, Bill is by no means an extraordinary human being, so anyone should be able to have a superpower. \n \n Going after his daily routine, Bill doesn \u2019 t give too much thought to this strange event. When he hears the door bell ring, Bill gets surprised. He hasn \u2019 t had a visitor in months and he doesn \u2019 t know who could possibly visit him without telling him beforehand, as Bill lives alone and doesn \u2019 t have any friends or relatives in this city. As Bill opens up the front door, he can see two figures in uniforms. The two men standing in Bill \u2019 s door are local policemen who have come to Bill \u2019 s house because of a false accusation. Without much talk the policemen take Bill with them to the local police station. \n After interrogating Bill for several hours, the investigators eventually find out that Bill is not the man they had been looking for. As it turns out, two Bills with the exact same last name reside in this city. This Bill had just been unlucky enough to fall victim to such an unlikely event, right after a seemingly impossible snow storm on the very same day. \n When Bill gets home, he feels tired and doesn \u2019 t know what to make of these events, so he heads to bed, still as confused as before. \n \n The next day Bill decides to head into town to buy a new pair of headphones. After the events of the previous days, Bill prepares himself for anything to happen at any time. For the longest time, nothing out of the ordinary occurs, until Bill is on his way back home from buying the headphones. Bill has never gotten into trouble with any strangers in his life before. This day however, Bill is suddenly stopped dead in his tracks by a group of menacing looking men wearing black leather jackets. Bill knows not to mess with people like them, but before he can fully understand the situation he is in, Bill is being dragged into a dark side alley by the large figures. Out of sight of the public, the four men start to threaten Bill by swinging around knives and showing off their guns. Bill is no longer scared of the guns, but he does not know what to do about the two men with knives. Suddenly, as Bill is carefully examining the shape of the two black guns in front of him, his right index finger turns into the barrel of a gun. Out of nowhere, Bill suddenly has a weapon with which he can defend himself. Still confused, Bill quickly acts and aims for the two knives first. With his first two shots, Bill immediately hits the knives and sends them flying. At the same time, the two pistols are fired at Bill's face. Without much effort, Bill reflects the bullets and sends them back at the men, hitting one of these strong figures with each bullet. All four of Bill \u2019 s opponents fall to the ground in pain. Before Bill can even realize what has just happened, the two policemen from the previous day suddenly show up in front of Bill, ready to take everyone present into custody. Not wanting any more unnecessary trouble, Bill accepts his fate for now and follows the men to the police station once again, this time accompanied by four actual criminals. \n \n For shooting a gun at these men and because of his previous incident with the police, Bill has to spend the night at the station. Fortunately however, the station has exactly five empty cells left, so each one of the culprits is put in a separate cell. Bill doesn \u2019 t have to worry about any of the men that attacked him, but he still has trouble falling asleep that night. \n \n The next morning Bill awakes to the sound of the other men singing. Oddly though, every one of the men is singing a different song and they are all trying to sing louder than the others. Having no idea what the past three days have been and what situation Bill is in now, he decides to sing his favorite song. Bill puts all his strength into his voice and sings even louder than the other men. After a short moment of singing, Bill notices the pressing silence that had suddenly befallen the police station cells. Confused, Bill stops his singing and waits for the policemen to come to his cell. \n \n But no one seems to be coming. Even after several hours of waiting, not a single soul has shown himself to Bill. By now Bill has grown very hungry, so he believes something abnormal to have happened at the station. As no one seems to be around, Bill uses his new gun powers to shoot the lock off of his cell door. With a bang the door opens and Bill is able to leave the cell. First, he takes a look into the other cells, but all the men are lying on the floor, completely motionless. Bill \u2019 s heart starts to race. As if to confirm his suspicions, he rushed out of the cell complex and into the main hall of the station. He can \u2019 t believe his own eyes. All the police men at the station are laying face first on the ground. Are they all... dead? Bill starts to panic. He slowly walks up to one of the bodies to check for their pulse. There is none. After checking all of the bodies in the room, Bill can not find a single one still alive. \n \n Bill had expected some strange events to happen this day, but he didn \u2019 t imagine such a thing could happen. Why are these men all dead? Why is Bill the only one still alive? Questions flood Bill \u2019 s usually simple mind, but not a single answer shows itself. Bill decides to leave the station and head into town. \n Everything about town seems to be normal. Across the street, Bill can see a young man playing on his guitar while singing Bill \u2019 s favorite song, hoping for passing strangers to give him their change. This scene reminds Bill of this morning, when he sang this very same song at the police station. Slowly, Bill begins to understand. His singing back then was immediately followed by total silence throughout the entire station. It can \u2019 t have been a coincidence. Bill doesn \u2019 t know why, but his singing must have killed all those men. His voice was loud enough to reach the ears of everyone at the station. Bill \u2019 s heart almost stops. He does not understand why or how, but he now possesses the power to decide between life and death, just by singing a simple song. \n \n When Bill returns to his senses, he realizes what this means. He now has the ability to slaughter everyone on this planet. After thirty years of agony, Bill finds himself in a position of power. Suddenly, Bill can take revenge on the world and its puny inhabitants. This thought excites the wicked man to no end. Without a shred of hesitation, Bill begins his act of vengeance. In the middle of his hometown, the place he had been living in for thirty years, the place he loathes the very most, Bill raises his voice. Dozens of pedestrians stop dead and fall to the ground. Although his tune had already brought about the desired result, Bill can \u2019 t stop himself from singing. With a huge, twisted smile on his face, Bill marches through the town, singing louder and louder as he goes. He spends hours visiting the most populated places in town, killing everyone his voice reaches. This scene continues, until Bill eventually finds himself tired from all the slaughter. In a now deserted park Bill takes seat on a bench and relaxes. He closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them again, he can feel a dark shadow on him, growing larger quickly. As he looks up into the sky, Bill finally realizes what happened on the day of the snow storm. With a loud, musical smack, Bill is crushed by the weight of a falling piano. What an incredibly unlikely event to happen, thought Bill to himself in his last moment before the impact. \n \n The powers: Trajectory Curving, Probability Modifying, Gun Protrusion and Death Song\n"}

Michael quickly got up and left. He had been thinking about it for some time and if he was to make it work he had to act fast. He walked up to Karl, `` I need a favor of you'' He and Karl went way back, and Karl owed him. Michael knew Karl was the only one he could trust, and it did n't hurt he was a prison guard. He handed over a crumpled up sheet, `` I need this done by Friday.'' \n `` You got it.'' Karl knew what this was about, he knew better than to question him. \n A few days went by and Michael was getting anxious; new dangers had appeared lately and he knew it would be for more difficult to pull off this time around, but he had no choice. He could n't pass off an opportunity like this, who knows when he'll get another chance? \n Friday finally came and everything was in place. The man was terrified by his recent experience but did not suspect anything. Michael walked towards the showers slowly, he was preparing mentally for what he had to do. You'd think he'd be used to it after so many but the human mind is so strange. \n he arrived at the showers, undressed and went in. The door opened to the left corner of the room, from there Michael could see everything. There were only three people, one at each corner away from the door. at the farthest corner stood the man, lightly dabbing at his arm, there seems to be some blood dripping from it. It seemed Karl had gone through for him, he did n't expect less. \n Michael approached the man. `` Hey guy, you new here? What's your name?'' he asked. \n The man looked back, `` Adolfo Garcia, what's it to you?'' \n Michael could n't help but let out a chuckle, `` you do n't look latino''. \n `` I got the looks from my mother's side. Do you mind? kinda busy here.'' \n Michael did n't budge. `` New tattoo? Just joined a gang right?'' \n `` Got ta survive here somehow, `` he said as he turned back. \n Micheal stood silent a few moments. `` I like it... looks just like mine.'' \n \n A week later the case was closed; classic case of prison violence. The guards were surprised by the brutality of the hot water; the victim's face could barely be made out. Still, the victim perfectly matched the description of one of the registered people in the showers at that time so he was quickly identified. No one really cared for Michael Williams; he was a convicted killer serving life. The way they saw it, they had just saved themselves some hard working tax payer's money.\n"}

While aboard their ship , you are chosen to give the alien elders a 5 minute pitch as to why the human race deserves to survive .\n","story":"The abduction was unexpectedly courteous. Considering the purpose, this may have been expected. The aliens arrived, and politely but firmly informed me that I should dress my best, prepare notes if so desired, and the purpose of my coming meeting. A kindness; I would hate to have wasted humanity \u2019 s most important five minutes on abject confusion. \n \n The suit had not seen much use since my Masters program concluded. Heck, I had to consult an image search to recall how to tie my tie. And my shoes, well\u2026 they were the most professional thing I owned for the purpose. Better than my garish neon-colored sneakers at least. \n \n The chamber was massive. Far larger than I had anticipated. Either their ship was absurd in size or they had some means of folding space. I wouldn \u2019 t know either way; one moment I stated I was ready, the next I was awash with scintillating colors and standing in what seemed a circular arena. On all sides sat countless beings like the ones who had come to me; pale grey flesh, elongated extremities, wide seeking eyes. Our vision of \u2018 greys \u2019 had been fairly close, if we \u2019 d then spliced them up with goldfish like some Pokemon concept art gone wrong. \n \n Within what I could only conceive of as a box seat sat one I assumed to be their elder. His- her? It? They? What pronoun do you use with a species you know nothing about? \u2013flesh was paler than the rest, and unlike the simple clothes of the others his was decorated with a bright purple sash. Made me more thankful I left the sneakers at home. Might \u2019 ve made me seem like I was dressing up above the leadership. \n \n \u201c We have gathered to hear this one, an example of the species known as \u2018 humans \u2019, as to the worth of their kind \u2019 s survival. Human, whatever name you go by, you represent not yourself but the whole of your people. Speak, then, on their behalf. \u201d \n \n Articulate. I assume some kind of technology was involved, unless their elder grew up in the United States, given how familiar the voice and accent came off. I cleared my throat, adjusted my tie, and began. \n \n \u201c Elder, gathered parties, thank you for your time. You have asked why we deserve to survive. The answer is itself a question; what criteria does one use to judge any race- any sentient being, for that matter \u2013to live or die? It \u2019 s a question my species has confronted before, time and again, both in actuality and in our fiction. \u201d A quick glance. A few were nodding, none seemed confused as far as I could tell. Okay, good, they either understand English \u2013and- human culture, or the tech they \u2019 re using is versatile enough to keep up with whatever their equivalent terms would be. \n \n \u201c Some, myself included, would argue that barring a grotesque break from social norms- senseless slaughter of the innocent or some equal crime \u2013any being capable of free will and thought is deserving of life. Others would argue towards value; a person deserves to live if they can function properly, create or build or- as required \u2013destroy. \n \n \u201c I can not pretend to know your philosophy. I could point to a thousand museums that together house a million works of art and crafts. I could point equally to a thousand libraries and their texts and tomes. I could point to a thousand military bases and everything within from the trained soldier to the meals ready to eat to armored vehicles and everything in between. Technology on the cutting edge, to the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. But none of this might sway you. \n \n \u201c I could appeal to your, as we say it, humanity. Point to schools filled with children, maternity wards filled with newborns, a class on graduation day, a couple at their wedding. \u201d I afford myself a pause. \u201c A grandfather on his death bed, beloved grandson and granddaughter at either side, tearful farewells on their lips. \u201d \n It \u2019 s hard to read a room when you don \u2019 t know the culture \u2019 s body language. But I can feel the weight of their eyes. I at least have their attention. \n \n \u201c Or, perhaps, your sense of fair play. Honor. After all, what I \u2019 ve seen suggests we \u2019 d probably be an easy fight for you. Bit of a technology gulf, you and us, at least at present. Or I could appeal to your curiosity. Look at our history, what we can do within five, ten, twenty years of a major discovery. How fast did we go from having no means of mechanical fight to international flights to landing on our moon? What might we do with, instead, a single nudge or idea from any one of you in this room? \n \n \u201c What about your sense of comradery? No species on earth seems a solitary one; is the same true for you? Would you erase peoples with whom you might share a conversation, a laugh, a smile? \u201d I point to one, which I can tell by the sudden start catches him- just rolling with that for now until I get proof otherwise \u2013unaware. \u201c Would you rather spend a day utterly alone, or with me along to help out with whatever needed doing, to talk and relax? \u201d I flash a grin. I \u2019 m horrible at grins. Never ask me to smile for a photo. But it has the effect I hoped it would. He seems to relax. \u201c Heck, dunno what you like to eat, but I \u2019 m a decent cook and a fast study. \u201d \n \n My arms extend wide to either side. \u201c So, what news? Have I persuaded any of you? Sold you on us? We can offer laughs and tears, smiles and frowns. We can build the finest cities and monuments, gaze in wonder at the stars, squabble over shiny rocks in the ground, and debate endlessly the nature of invisible intangible concepts. We can create worlds that never were and express them in text and song and picture. We can take the impossible, make it improbable, make it possible, and then make it a simple everyday fact of life. And! \u201d A finger pointed high. \u201c You would not believe what we can do with a mystery basket of ingredients in thirty minutes or less. Seriously, if you can intercept telecommunication signals, find a television program called Chopped. That should tell you all you need to know about keeping us around. \u201d \n \n I take a breath. I \u2019 m sweating bullets, and only now realized it. Yay adrenaline. Am I at my limit? Would they tell me if I was? It felt like five minutes have passed. I wish I \u2019 d brought a wristwatch. Wish I had one with a fresh battery; not much of a need with smartphones around, until you \u2019 re abducted and dancing as fast as you can to not get humanity killed. \n \n Then, something sounds out. Laughter. The elder alien is laughing. I think it \u2019 s laughter, it sounds like laughter. Maybe it \u2019 s how they speak? But no, the laughter spreads, and now more than just that one is laughing. They \u2019 re all laughing. \n \n \u201c Human\u2026 let me see if I \u2019 ve got this right. You \u2019 re given five minutes to convince us your species should exist, and you close out with a cooking show? \u201d \n \n \u201c Um\u2026 yes? \u201d I shrug nervously. \u201c I figured it might buy us an extra hour. Forty minutes without commercials, at least. \u201d \n \n Another round of laughter. Then the lead alien sighs. \u201c Human, I thank you. That was worth this. You \u2019 re a decent salesman. \u201d I smile. \u201c Decent, not great. I \u2019 ll give you \u2018 articulate \u2019 as well. \u201d His hand wavers in a so-so motion. Now this is getting weird. That \u2019 s a very, well, us sort of idiom. \n \n \u201c So\u2026 does this mean we live? \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh, that was never in doubt. \u201d What. My expression seems to convey that word well enough. \u201c Well, we said for you to give us a speech as to why your kind should live. The worth of your survival, I believe I said myself. I never said that was going to be the judging criteria. \n \n \u201c You surely did not think we \u2019 d grab a single person, out of all your species, and expect within so short a timeframe for you to somehow convey to us all that which your kind could offer. Did you? What if we had chosen someone who had hatred in them, or great sorrow? Someone who couldn \u2019 t sell or speak to large gatherings at all out of\u2026 \u201d A strange atonal set of noises followed. \u201c Stage fright? \u201d \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s the phrase, yeah\u2026 but\u2026 then why all this? \u201d \n \n \u201c You said it yourself. Laughter and tears, smiles and frowns. You acquitted yourself decently, and your kind- while it has many problems \u2013is indeed worthy of survival by our criteria. But, well\u2026 \u201d He sighed. \u201c We came so far, and have been watching so damn long. After all that, we needed a bit of humor before we did anything else. \u201d \n I could feel my smile threatening to split my face wide open. \u201c So, okay, great! Awesome, even! What, uh, what now? \u201d \n \n \u201c You go back, we work out the means by which we \u2019 ll come down and introduce ourselves- we \u2019 re leaning towards some sort of video or audio warning first, do you think that \u2019 s wise? \u201d I give a nod. \u201c Thought so too. We \u2013have- seen your The Day The Earth Stood Still, after all. \u201d \n \n \u201c The original I hope. \u201d \n \n \u201c We saw both. We \u2019 ve seen it all. Nice thing about those \u2018 telecommunication signals \u2019 as you put it, your kind really likes to play everything old and new these days. We \u2019 re hoping to avoid the trappings of danger and threat if possible. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh. Okay. That\u2026 you \u2019 re not using a machine to understand me or vice versa right now, are you? \u201d \n \u201c As you would say, nope. \u201d \n \n A nervous laugh escaped me. \u201c Wow, okay. So\u2026 hey, if you need another laugh, or something, come on by? \u201d \n \n The elder chuckled. \u201c We \u2019 ll hold you to that. Farewell, human. Expect to hear from us soon. \u201d \n \n That was two days ago. I guess, after their signal went global, I won \u2019 t be thought of as too much of a crackpot if I tell my story now. They \u2019 re showing up in person only in a few places, all limited and protected as to avoid too much danger. What happens next, honestly, I couldn \u2019 t say. They seemed like a decent sort, but I never found out what already sold them on us. Here \u2019 s hoping it \u2019 s more \u2018 Star Trek \u2019 and less \u2018 To Serve Man \u2019. \n\n"}

At least once a week, my slumber will be broken by an incompetent crowd of loonies who think that the magic sword they were given by the lady of the lake entitles them to my treasure. \n \n Of course, one quick puff of fire and they soon learn that some watery tart in a pond distributing swords is no basis for determining their entitlement to *my* belongings. Unfortunately, they only have about a second to dwell on their idiocy before I take the most valuable objects from their charred backpacks. I think I should look into finding a new cave, but I've lived here for several thousand years, the humans only came here a few hundred years ago. \n \n But, I ca n't complain, my life is pretty simple here. Some humans have taken to offering me tributes in the form of food and gold. I tried saying that it was n't necessary but they were to afraid of me to understand me. No matter, though, my hoard is growing and I have no need to hunt. The nuisance of the heroes is just a minor concession. \n \n My musings were cut short by a soft *clink*, and then another and as I turned my head I saw the most peculiar thing. Before me stood a human knight. Unlike the heroes of before, he was giving me money. He reached into a coin purse and one by one he threw the coins onto my hoard. \n \n `` I see I have your attention, oh mighty Al'Kathum,'' the hero paused his movements to look me in the eye. \n \n I sighed, smoke rising from my nostrils. I have n't seen this act in a hundred years, but it's still just as boring as ever. Usually the `` lone'' hero tries to charm me with words while a few mages, archers and rogues sneak in for a surprise attack. But he had my interest with his next sentence. \n \n `` I have a rather lucrative proposition for you,'' he said slowly, `` you see, there's this princess. Princess Blythe, I believe her name is. Anyway, I seem to have picked up a reputation as a rather, *ahem*, ineffective knight. So I got to thinking. I've put my family's wealth to use a built a tower, nice and secluded over here.'' \n \n He pulled out a map and pointed to a location a few miles south of my tower and east of what I assumed was the kingdom where this princess lived. `` Anyway, my plan is simple. I wish to impress the princess and the king so that I may receive her hand in marriage. And I need your help.'' \n \n Ah, so he seeks a boon. Often I will get members of the cult who worships me coming in and asking for such a thing. Usually they ask for enhanced strength or magic, and they always offer something meager like the rest of their lifetime in servitude. Do they not know that their lifetimes are as short to me as the days are to them? \n \n `` I get the feeling that you're not easily persuaded,'' the man continued. Why has n't he left me to my slumber yet? Can he not see that I care not for his problems? `` So let me sweeten the deal. If you kidnap the princess and put on a show while I rescue her, I will give you a portion of the treasury in taxes each year. I will use the wealth and might of my nation to serve you as a vassal kingdom. Just imagine walking through a hallway made of gold, lined with precious gems and filled with all manner of priceless goods.'' \n \n I guess he does know how what he's doing. Over the remainder of the day, he outlined his plans for the `` main event'' as he called it. I would occasionally remark about the folly of some ideas. ( I mean, carrying the princess in my mouth? What kind of barbarism is that? ) Eventually, however, we worked out a plan that seemed to work out for the both of us. I would be intimidating and strike fear into everyone while he would be a legend among men. \n \n A few weeks later, I flew out and kidnapped the princess, hiding her in the tower. Some knights of the kingdom arrived and they were easily incapacitated, minor casualties for the sake of appearing evil. Eventually, the knight from the cave arrived, gave a flashy speech and then we got down to `` fighting''. Eventually I flew away while he gave chase, and then he rescued the princess. \n \n A few years later he visited me with a caravan loaded with gold and gemstones. `` This is the first tribute from the kingdom of Kathum'Rei,'' he said, `` already, we are conquering the neighboring nations and adding their wealth to our own. The next few years will be very profitable, oh Great One.'' \n \n Then he left, returning on the same day of each year with loaded wagons of gold. This whole kidnapping thing seemed to be pretty lucrative, so one day I started getting to work, kidnapping princesses ( and the occasional prince ) in return for ransoms or vassalage. \n \n I am the mighty Al'Kathum, actor for hire. For only the low price of-' \n \n The old wizard waved his hand and the image on the scrying screen disappeared. `` Bloody informercials,'' he muttered, `` that's the last time I buy one of these at a discount.'' \n \n *** \n \n *I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it!

I spun around, looking for the source. Suddenly, I felt something lightly bump me on the head, and immediately saw what appeared to be a Noctowl flying away. But I had never seen a Noctowl like this before. It was smaller, fluffier, and as white as snow. A shiny, maybe? I never found out. \n \n Looking down at the ground, I saw what had hit me in the head. I yellowish-white envelope, sealed with red wax. I picked it up and flipped it over. `` Red Potter'' it said in spindly script. \n \n I looked around. Aside from a few townspeople I saw every day making there way about the town, there did n't seem to be anyone who might have had something to do with this. I figured opening a letter could n't do that much harm, so I snapped the seal and read the message within: \n \n *To Master Red Potter, * \n \n *We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. * \n \n No sooner had I read the words `` a list of all necessary books and equipment'' than a second page fell out of the envelope. It indeed listed the names of several books by authors with strange names, and included odd items such as cauldrons, plants I'd never heard of, and body parts of what I assume were new kinds of Pokemon. Honestly, the thought of dealing with dismembered Pokemon struck me as rather morbid, but I was too confused by this letter to be very concerned by it. \n \n [ I have to go to my next class right now but I'll continue this later. ]\n"}

Everyone that \u2019 s shown up is a mathematician \u2014 \u201c Einstein \u2019 s eyes light up. \n \n \u201c Wait a minute \u2014 I remember something! When I showed up, there were two guys, both mathematicians, in front of me, and another guy right beside me. Behind me, four mathematicians showed up. Always mathematicians. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, so? \u201d \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s exponential population growth! The amount of growth depends on the size of the current population. In this case, it grows by exactly as big as it is. It seems that the mathematicians will bring on the arrival of more mathematicians. \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay. \u201d \n \n \u201c There isn \u2019 t an infinite number of mathematicians, they \u2019 re just populating faster than the universe gets rid of them, asymptotically speaking. \u201d \n \n \u201c I was totally thinking the same thing. \u201d \n \n \u201c So, we just have to get rid of them exponentially. The problem is, how can we possibly match their rate of growth? We \u2019 d have to have an infinite energy source to off that many mathematicians. \u201d \n \n \u201c We don \u2019 t have to kill them. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t see an alternative. \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, you said that mathematicians means more mathematicians. Why don \u2019 t we just make them forget? \u201d says the bartender, clutching a bottle of Jack Daniels as emphasis. \n \n \u201c Okay \u2014 assuming this asinine method actually works \u2014 how are we going to spread the liquor exponentially? \u201d \n \n \u201c Peer pressure? \u201d Mel deadpans. \n \n \u201c Fuck it.

Everyone \u2019 ll get how much they want, \u201d says Mel, recalling his time in pre-calculus. \n \n \u201c Clever, but it won \u2019 t work. The last mathematician will get an infinitesimally small amount of beer \u2014 far less than one molecule \u2019 s worth. We \u2019 re geeks, but we \u2019 re not that much of lightweights. \u201d \n \n The door starts to crack under the mass of mathematicians. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ll say. There \u2019 s a huge keg on the right side of the bar I have for special occasions. If we open that, they \u2019 ll get hammered. Then, we got ta hope the vomit passes on the alcohol when it \u2019 s gone. \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay. \u201d \n \n \u201c Now or never. \u201d \n \n \u201c Right. \u201d The two bust through the door, hands held. Bodies flood through the opening, but they manage to stay on the top layer. \n \n \u201c IT \u2019 S NO GOOD, THE KEG \u2019 S ALL BLOCKED OFF! \u201d Mel yells, barely audible over the near-infinite drone of TOS-TNG debates. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 LL HANDLE THEM. YOU GO ON! \u201d Einstein \u2019 s grip loosens. Mel holds on. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 M NOT LEAVING YOU IN THERE. \u201d \n \n \u201c MAYBE BLACK HOLES ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE. \u201d \n \n \u201c ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. TELL ME ONE THING BEFORE YOU GO \u2014 WHY DIDN \u2019 T YOU ASK \u2014 \u201d \n \n \u201c WHAT? I CAN \u2019 T HEAR YOU. \u201d \n \n \u201c I SAID, WHY DIDN \u2019 T YOU ASK FOR A DRINK? \u201d \n \n Einstein has already slipped through. \n \n \u201c HEY, EVERYBODY, I GOT A FRACTAL \u2014 IN MY PANTS! \u201d \n \n Suddenly, Mel could see the keg, in all its glory. As his hands wrap around the lever, he looks back and sees Einstein \u2019 s blond spiky hair dip below the sea of bodies. \n \n \u201c SOH-CAH-TOA later, \u201d Mel says, at a loss for something catchy to say, and pulls the lever with all his might. \n \n The sun \u2019 s wrath wakes Mel up. Rough hangover, but he \u2019 s had worse. The passed out bodies of thousands upon thousands of mathematicians lay all around him. He gets up, tries to remember where Einstein went down \u2014 when suddenly, it hits him. \n \n \u201c \u2018 That about sums it up. \u2019 Shit, that \u2019 s way cooler than what I said. Oh well. \u201d \n \n Einstein \u2019 s spiky blonde hair protrudes in the left corner of the bar. When Mel bends down to check for a pulse, Einstein sits up and vomits what, even in spite of everything, could only be described as an infinite stream. Einstein, wholly embarrassed, tries to stand up, with no luck. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m so sorry, erm\u2026 \u201d \n \n \u201c Mel. \u201d \n \n \u201c Hi, Mel, My name \u2019 s Gabe.

She's deaf!'' \n \n When we met that weekend in a grassy field I ca n't remember because all I cared about was you, we were lined up for breakfast, and I verbally asked your name. As though from many past experiences with hearing people like me, you turned to Natalie and asked her to tell me that you were Deaf. \n \n I had been taking ASL for two years at that point, and I excitedly waved my hand to get your attention, and introduced myself in your language.

There was a spark, a look of sheer joy that there was someone else you could talk too! \n \n From that minute, I knew I loved you. \n \n The rest of that weekend, we talked about ourselves. Where we came from. I lived in Portland, and you lived in San Francisco. A tiny voice told me to leave you to stop me from hurting later on, just like it always told me whenever my heart ached for a girl. But you were different. You were adorable, funny, able to hold a conversation, willing to teach me more, allowing me to teach you, we swapped books and life stories. \n \n We fit perfectly together. \n \n Over the following four weeks, our time together was short; we only saw each other from Friday evenings to Sunday mornings, and even then only for a few hours at a time.

The two 60 watt bulbs did their best but the room was too big for them so remained mostly hidden. \n \n `` Hi Kevin,'' the people in the room changed back automatically. \n \n `` It's, uh, it's been six weeks since my last spell. I've been working the steps, ya know? Though I skipped the one about turning myself over to a higher power - that's what got me into trouble in the first place.'' Kevin gave a little chuckle. \n \n `` I saw on the news today that Magisterio The Unknown got caught. Some guy in frickin' Kansas of all places. Just some redneck that got bored and started riding the lightning. I thought back to what Dillon told us - we have an addiction, the addiction does n't have us.'' \n \n Kevin sat down to a smattering of light applause. Dillion, an older man with a white beard that was threatening to annex his entire head, sat to the side of the podium and said, `` Thank you Kevin. I'd like to hear from our new member Rachel.'' \n \n A short, black-haired girl who could n't have been much older than 20 years nor much less than 200 pounds stared back at Dillon. Finally, she stood up and sashayed her way up to the podium. \n \n `` Hi, my name is Raveness of the Dark -'' Rachel started. \n \n `` Excuse me, no. Sorry. We use our real names here sweetie,'' Dillion said. \n \n `` Do n't call me sweetie!''

I guess whatever.'' \n \n `` And how long has it been since your last spell?'' Dillon asked quietly. \n \n `` I toss one off in the car over here. Knocked over some bums grocery cart.'' Rachel tried to sound flippant. \n \n `` But that's not all that happened, is it?'' \n \n ``... No. I smashed the car window too. My mom was driving. She started screaming at me.'' \n \n `` That's why we're here. Every single one of us in this room knows that rush of a well-times spell. We know how empowering it is.

It's ok - you're among friends.'' \n \n `` Brittany Miller. She's a cheerleader at school. She's always been a bitch to me since grade school. I got tired of it one day. I researched a spell to make her shut up.'' \n \n `` And did she?'' \n \n `` Shut up? Yeah. They told me the spell took out her entire speech center of her brain. She could n't talk or understand anything. They arrested me. The judge said since it was my first offense he'd give me community service and I had to come to this stupid meeting.'' \n \n `` What happened to the other girl?'' An older lady, maybe a little frumpy, asked. \n \n `` They got one of those spell-reversal teams to look at her. Last I heard, she was mostly healed. I got kicked out of school so I do n't know for sure.'' \n \n `` Rachel, that's why we meet. It's too easy for some of us to fall back into our old ways. Magic is too wild and uncontrollable. That rush of power is incredibly addictive. With these meetings though, we can help each other through.'' \n \n `` What the hell do you people know about it?'' \n \n `` Kevin, who you just heard, used magic to win a game of darts in a bar.

Men and women, even children, screamed and chanted, one even through a rock at the bench, where I would... put him to rest. It was awfully cold, I could see my foggy breath rising before my eyes. \n \n Out of the corner of my left eye, I spotted him. Robert Vincent, found guilty of theft, a lawyer. His eyes were full of emotion, and he was looking at the ground as a guard pushed him forward. Slowly, he inched towards the steps onto the bench. I rubbed my meaty shoulder and stared, minutes before I would go up. \n \n `` Robert Actus Vincent, found guilty of theft.'' Cries from the crowd, `` Settle down! Settle down!'' The crowd only toned their attitude a notch, it was still heated with anger and disgust throughout the many women and children. \n \n He knelt down slowly, his hands put behind his back in handcuffs, his hair matted down. He weeped softly; I could tell he was regretting stealing the loaf of bread. Typical actions from a man sentenced to death; regretting the action that put your head onto the ground. \n \n It was my time. I held the axe in my clammy hands, shaking with the knowledge of what would come. It was disgusting; my sixty-something execution. The axe method of execution was coming to an end, guillotines made up of nine-tenths of all execution, which meant that this would be one of my last. \n \n I made my way up the wooden stairs, my beard sweaty, the man laying calmly on the wooden table. He was breathing normally, which was what really got me. Robert was one of the calmest men I'd ever executed. \n \n When I took the axe to his head, he said no words at all. It was rather heroic in a way, and I respected him. Lots of men and women make a fuss, one tried even running away. \n \n After the axe sunk into his head, it was a mess, as usual. The crowds cheered, and eventually drifted off. Me? I stayed for a while, as they mopped up his remains, planning, thinking about a major decision in my life. \n \n That day was the last execution I ever did. I made a decent living, but it was too extreme for even me, a semi-barbaric man, to do. I packed up my things, and made off into the snowy woods beyond my house, leaving the axe I'd used to kill Robert in a muddy stream, and went to Roberts grave, where I placed the petals of a rose in respect for the man, and whispered, `` Adieu.'' \n \n Farewell.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You and your team of scientists have invented a handheld device that allows people to time travel . On another note , it 's Bring Your Child to Work Day , and you ca n't seem to find out where your kid ran off to .\n","story":"The lab was filled with the chatter of over-caffeinated interns and the grumbles of under-caffeinated senior devs. Beakers clinked in earsplitting unison as janitors dropped tubfuls of them onto tabletops. Here and there, sparks fizzled and popped; on occasion, they snapped, causing surprised researchers to walk backwards into their chairs. They clanged on the metal floor, momentarily deafening unfortunate bystanders and passersby. \n \n It was quiet. Too quiet. \n \n Sophie looked up from her research manual. Harry was n't tugging at her coat. He was n't tying her shoelaces together. He was n't jumping up and down next to her, asking if he could use the welding torch or drink the time potion or play BirdVille on her phone. She patted both her pockets and felt nothing. The realization punctured her in the gut, sending cold, prickling dread seeping through her entire body. \n \n Sophie slid her goggles to rest on her forehead. Foregoing eye protection in the lab was against regulations, but so was losing your kid at work. She strode around the room's perimeter, her eyes leaping back and forth between crannies and shadows in search of Harry. Her ears perked up, awaiting a crash or a smash or any other discordant noise. But no sign of Harry presented itself: the lab continued to run in its perpetual state of peaceful business, and anxiety continued to brew within Sophie's stomach. \n \n After three fruitless circles, she took to asking her coworkers, starting with the cleaning staff and the interns lest her superiors reprimand her or her peers judge her. `` Have you seen Harry?'' she asked. Each person shrugged or shook their head until she got to Gerald. \n \n `` Yeah, I saw him.'' The old janitor smacked his gum and pointed to the doorway. `` Went out there. Had a phone or something in his hand.'' Gerald shook his head and grinned. `` Bet he's found a nook to hide out in. Kids always trying to squeeze into the tightest spaces. I reckon they just wan na get back in the womb...'' \n \n Sophie forced a smile and patted his shoulder before bustling towards the doorway, her ponytail swinging excitedly. Momentum carried her down the hallway, past the offices and the other lab, all the way to the supply closet. Sophie unlocked it and fished in the dark, inside the crate two over from the right wall, for a TimePhone. Upon retrieving one, she input the time for one hour in the past. She was n't going to alter the past. All she would do was observe. Keep track of Harry this time. Redeem herself as a mother. Every good parent deserved at least one do-over, she thought. \n \n One hour earlier, Sophie cracked the broom closet door open and peered down the hallway, waiting for Harry to emerge. Within ten minutes, she saw him exit the lab and toddle down the hall, his eyes glued to her red TimePhone. He glanced up every few seconds to check the doors lining each side of the hallway before finally coming across an unlocked supply closet. Harry slid inside and clicked the door shut. \n \n With her newfound knowledge, Sophie reversed to the present and burst out of her own closet. With any luck, Harry had n't figured out how to configure the TimePhone yet. Her heart thumped with anticipation as she rushed down the hall, her mind split between formulating a lecture and an emergency time rescue plan. Her hand closed around the knob of the supply closet, and she wrenched it open. \n \n Harry shoved the TimePhone between his knees and attempted his best expression of innocence. He looked anything but, though, perched on a mop cart with a guilty smile wrapping around his face. Sophie allowed herself an internal sigh of relief, but at the same time hardened her face, attempting to compensate for her lapse in authority. `` You're in big trouble, young man.'' She yanked the phone from between his legs. `` Time travel is dangerous. Under no circumstances are you allowed to touch this phone.'' Sophie waggled it to emphasize her point, daring Harry to challenge her. \n \n Protest marked Harry's face for a fleeting moment, but he seemed to think better of it. He shut his mouth and hung his head, though Sophie doubted he was truly contrite. She motioned him towards the elevator, swiping her thumb across the bottom of her phone as they walked. She expected to see the Time Travel app, but to her surprise, the display was instead the title screen of BirdVille. Sophie frowned: something seemed off about it. As the elevator descended, she stared at the birds flying perpetually in the background. \n \n Normally, an ad would have popped up after a few seconds. \n \n Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Harry peeking at the phone, turning away when he noticed her glance. Sophie navigated to her phone's purchase history and checked the most recent figure. It was in the triple digits. \n \n She jabbed the icon of the Time Travel app.\n"}

As I turn over in bed to face my long time partner. I am greeted by a tray of steaming food slowly being placed on my waist. \n \n `` My favorite,'' I quietly exclaimed, sitting up, still half asleep. `` French Toast with strawberries and *yawn* mint water.'' She smiled. `` You're the big seven-o! How does it to feel to be one step closer to the grave?'' As she chuckled, I snarkily reminded her that she was closer than I was. `` In fact, I can almost smell the embalming fluid on you.'' She laughed. \n \n As I finished my breakfast in bed, my wife of 32 years left and went back down stairs to the kitchen to clean up the left over mess. As I start to roll out of bed, I hear our cat's bell jingle. `` Hey, Genevra!'' I yell towards the doorway. `` Have you looked at the cat's date lately?'' `` No,'' she quickly replied, as I heard the squeak of the kitchen spout turn on. `` I'll check his date later.'' After hearing her response, I quickly realized how complacent I've become with her 6^th ability, the ability to read the death date of all living thing's. I got dressed and took my tray of plates and utensils down stairs. \n \n She described her 6^th ability to me one time. She said it was just numbers that floated above living creature's heads in the classic month, day, and year order. Although, those numbers were always changing depending on the decisions people made. One time as a young girl, she watched a man's date change to the very next day moments after he had hung up the phone inside a telephone booth. Ever since then, she has only used her 6^th ability selectively. Mostly on her pets to ease the pain of them passing on. \n \n As I past her in the kitchen and placed a small peck on her gray head, I wondered if I would live to ever see my 6^th ability emerge. Hell, at this pointed I'd take a commoner's enhanced 5^th ability. Some super strength would come in handy at this old age. I would finally have the strength back in my hips and I would n't be so slow moving around. \n Most humans get an enhanced 5^th ability. Smell, sight, that sort of thing. But some are blessed with a 6^th ability. Those powers that do n't come from one of the 5 senses. And no human has ever been recorded of dieing without one of the two abilities at some point in their life. I walk into the living room to search for the TV remote when suddenly, someone pounded on my front door. \n \n `` Mark, Mark! Are you home?! Hurry, open up!'' The voice muffled by the door sounded familiar. I cracked open the door and to my surprise, I saw an old acquaintance of mine. `` Billy,'' I confusingly stated while opening the rest of the door. `` What are you doing here? I recall paying you to silently *stay away*.'' He looked a bit shorter than I remember, with hair peaking out of his nose, a raisin for a bald head, and waring dirty old baggy clothes on. The last 30 years were not as kind to him. Maybe that was my ability I thought. `` I would n't come if it was n't important Mark.'' He urged in a shushed tone. `` Talk to me out here for a moment.'' As he stepped away from the door and walked towards the front of my garage. I turned to the kitchen and lifted my voice, `` Hey Hun, I got ta talk to this guy for minute. I'll just be out front.'' I did n't wait for a response as I shut the door behind me and hobbled toward Billy. He looked nervous, obviously something was amiss. \n \n `` I'll make this quick Mark. You do n't have much time.'' As he said this, he raised his hand and started to rub his temple and told me something I never thought I would hear. `` The FBI have located you, partner. Someone saw the story about you on America's Most Wanted and turned in a tip.'' Time seemed to have stopped. By now his hand moved from his temple to my shoulder. In the past, I would of never allowed him to touch me. With his ability, every time he touched someone, he gained random knowledge from the person he was in-contact with. But this moment was different from any other. \n \n He quickly reeled his hand back and I regained my composer. `` How did you find out? I asked. `` The last working connection I have inside the Bureau contacted me yesterday. I drove all night from Portland to tell you. I could n't risk my safety over the phone to warn you.'' `` Luckily for you, Seattle is n't too far of a drive.'' I respond and turned to start to walking back inside. `` Wait,'' Billy exclaimed. `` That's it? You do n't even seem scared.'' I turned my head back at him and replied, `` I've been prepared for this for the last few years now. I did n't think it would happen, but I'm ready. Take care Billy and get outta here.'' As I continued my walk back, I heard him mumble under his breath, `` Still the same asshole.'' \n \n I was inside when I heard his car engine start and take off. \n I quickly made my way to the stairs and went into my bedroom. The top drawer was my target. Inside was a Glock G17 that I quickly shoved into my waistline and made my way back down stairs and to the door. `` Gen,'' I shouted as I stepped out of the house. `` I'm going for a quick walk, I'll be back soon. Love ya.'' `` Love you too.'' And with that, I slowly shut the door and make my way to the sidewalk to look at my house, for the last time. \n \n The memories came and went quick. We had lived in this house for 15 years. We traveled all over the world before settling here. I never stayed in one place for long. I started my walk away from home and headed towards downtown. It was n't too far away. The sun had hid it's self behind dark grey clouds like it does on most days. As the suburban slowly started to turn into the city, I started to remember back to all the crimes Billy and I committed in our youth. With his ability to collect random information from people. We would set our mark on banks. He'd bump into, shake hands, or do anything to touch the most important heads of security until he gathered the information we needed as I broke in and stole the cash, or simply gave up and moved onto a different. Which made our hits so random, no police in any part of the world could keep up or predict where we would strike next. Law enforcement for years thought that I had an ability that world had never seen before. We stole millions over a nine year period. Than, I met Gen. I continued to steal and occasionally murder, when someone thought about being a hero. But I did n't want her to find out and the traveling salesman cover story was getting harder and harder to keep up. So Billy and I split the money and parted ways, to only move a state away from each other. \n \n As my reminiscing concluded, I noticed was downtown near Pike's place. I could smell the fresh catch and see the crowd gathered around the men tossing fish across the booths to each other. I slip down an alley way. A short cut to The Pink Door I know for one last drink. \n \n I sit down. `` Chardonnay, please.'' I shout to the waiter walking towards me. He turns around and heads to the back. Never been much a whiskey guy, and I was n't going to start today. That's when I see the FBI bust in through the front door. The lead agent is dressed in all black with FBI on the front in white screams, `` Mark Hamilton!'' Get on the ground, **now**! More agents pour in with guns drawn, all pointing at me. All dressed the same with helmets and body armor. I can only see just above the bridge of their nose and below the brow. Before they can get set and on their knees, I quickly pull out my Glock and point the barrel at my own temple. \n \n The lead man lowers his gun and starts talking, but I ca n't hear a word he utters. All that I hear is the voice of Gen. All the memories flood back, and all but confirms I'm doing the right thing. I ca n't have her knowing that I did those things. I murdered many people and stole from many countries. At best, I can die in this shoot out and have her doubt that I actually did it. She'll think, `` They had the wrong man, my husband would never do those things. He was a good man!'' This this the best I can do, and I all I can hope for. The gun pointed at head is just to by time, to jog a last few memories before I turn this gun on the agents in front of me. \n \n As I turn the Glock towards the agents still shouting, I notice one of the agents forearms are massive. He's also the first to squeeze his trigger along with myself, and yet, my trigger feels so heavy. Not because of age, ( I had practiced shooting this gun last week. ) All that was running through my mind, was the guilt of leaving Gen behind. \n \n My trigger never gave. Only one shot was fired. I felt it pierce my forehead but I did n't feel any pain. I fall out of my chair and onto the floor as my eyes slowly closed, and all I could see was her smile. With tears stinging my eyes, I force them shut. \n \n To my surprise, I reopened my eyes. I saw watery agents looking at me still in their knelled positions. `` They must of just grazed me.'' I assumed. I quickly get up and see multiple bullets fly into my chest. `` It's over.'' I mumble to myself as my body falls backwards and hits the floor once more, just to lay there in an unspeakable amount of pain. I see my blood everywhere and some brain matter from the first shot. That's when the rest of my intact brain puts together what's going on. \n \n Happy birthday to me. \n \n I had passed out from the pain and came to wearing cuffs and a body chain which is strapped down to the van carrying me. After a few silent moments. I started to laugh. The agents look at me funny, as my laugh grew louder and louder to this thought: What would of Gen saw if she had looked at my date?\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are an early-adolescent teen . You 're elderly relative is dying . On their last legs , they want to show you something that will stay with you forever\n","story":"Grandpa Earl looked his grandchild in the eyes and smiled the kindly smile that Connor loved so much. His smile was a reflection of his kind soul. Earl always had a smile or a joke at the ready whenever someone needed it. Sometimes even when they did n't know they did. Earl knew his grandson needed a smile now. \n \n `` Does it hurt, Grandpa?'' Connor asked. `` The cancer?'' \n \n Earl, honest to a fault, said, `` Yes. Yes it does, son.'' \n \n `` I do n't want you to go, but I do n't want you to hurt anymore.'' Connor swiped at his eyes with his shirtsleeve and tried to put on a brave face for this man who raised him after his mother had died just three years earlier. `` Remember when I fell and hurt my teeth? You came out and took me to the doctor. Does it hurt like that?'' \n \n `` No, Connor, not like that. It's more like...'' Earl winced and continued, `` more like just really sleepy, but you ca n't just tap a nap and feel better.'' \n \n Connor tried stop the tears but could n't. His grandfather had been a large, strong man for as long as he could remember but over the last few months had atrophied to nothing. His sallow skin stretched taut across his knuckles, knees, and shoulders. Every time Connor looked at him he was reminded of how quickly he had withered away. Earl noticed the way Connor looked at him, and it saddened him, too, but he smiled. It seemed to be the only thing about him that never withered. \n \n `` Connor, hand me my wallet. It's on the nightstand.'' \n \n Connor followed the trembling hand as it pointed and he tried to ignore the tubes going into the machines, into his grandpa. He picked up the worn leather wallet and placed it in Earl's hand. \n \n `` Son, I have always kept this in my wallet and whenever I've had a tough day I think about it. My grandfather told me about this when he died, and he said his grandfather did the same. It's a tradition in our family. And now-'' \n \n A coughing fit racked Earl's frail form. Connor watched, wishing he could help. \n \n `` Now, I'd like to show it to you. Keep it for your grandson, but I do n't want you to forget about it. I'd like you to keep this in your wallet for those gloomy days.'' \n \n `` I do n't have a wallet.'' \n \n `` You do n't? Well, then, we'll have to fix that.'' Earl emptied the contents of his wallet onto the bed next to him. He held out the wallet to Connor who took it reverently. \n \n `` Promise me you wo n't forget, Connor.'' \n \n `` I wo n't forget. I promise.'' Tears spilled freely down Connor's face. \n \n `` Look in the billfold pocket.'' \n \n Grandpa Earl smiled in contentment and closed his eyes. Connor opened the wallet, the softened leather creaking but inaudible over the sound of the machines surrounding his grandfather. He looked into the wallet and saw a folded piece of paper in the corner. He took it out and turned it over in his hands. Connor glanced up at his grandfather, who had stopped breathing. \n \n Knowing that his grandfather had died, but wanting to honor his last moment before interrupting it with the hospice nurse and the calls he knew he'd have to make Connor stood and kissed his grandfather on his still-warm forehead. He looked down at the piece of paper and opened it. A naked picture of his grandmother stared back at him.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` Do or do not , there is no try . '' Only a Sith deals in absolutes , Tell the story of Darth Yoda .\n","story":"The door panel of the spacecraft shifted open. Luke sighed loudly. The nose of the aircraft had sunk deep into the marshy lake, and with the mist around him he could barely identify his surroundings. `` Are you able to pick anything up, R2?'' The beeps that followed confirmed his initial suspicions. `` Thought not'', he mumbled. He pressed a few buttons on the control panel, and a small gangway extended from underneath the plane towards the solid ground. \n \n He lifted himself out of the cabin, took his backpack from behind the seat and swung it over his shoulder. `` You stay here, I should be back soon.'' \n \n Luke carefully stepped on the narrow, rigid metal. He knew Dagobah was a swamp system, and while he knew not much lived here, he felt something was n't just quite right. The thick pool of water underneath him felt like it stirred, as if something loomed from the water. Small shadows surfaced in the water, but nothing disrupted the seeming calm of it. Small bubbles exploded rhythmically, and the smell of sulfur filled the air around him. With held breath Luke made his way to the other side of the gangway. He found himself at the edge of one of the larger pools in his surrounding, but nowhere he saw or heard of any sign of life other than the unconcerned breathing of the pool. \n \n And yet... \n \n Luke felt as something approached him. It was something unearthly, something that was n't here before. It was something eternal, something existential, something far more powerful than he had come here to meet. Dread. \n \n Forgetting the terrible smell, Luke inhaled deeply, and immediately choked on the thick air. Coughing into the arm that now covered the bottom part of his face he walked away from the sense that crawled around him. The feeling of anger, hate, suffering, failure and fear disturbed him to his core. Every step he set in the other direction it felt as the air grew thinner, and the smell subsided. After a few minutes he felt enough at ease to slide down a tree and rest on the damp moss, still panting from the choke hold he had just escaped from. \n \n `` Tired, we are?'' a voice sounded above him. \n \n Luke stood upright before he processed what happened. His heart had skipped a beat, but his instinctive Jedi training took over seamlessly. His gaze shot up, scanning the thick leaves of the trees all around him, but he could n't identify where the sound had come from. A few moments passed, and Luke absently wiped the sweat off his forehead. \n \n `` Find me any longer, you can not'', he heard, now coming from the opposite direction. Luke reached for the light saber that was attached to his belt, and rested his hand on it. `` Because found you, I already have.'' \n \n A small green creature suddenly jumped out of the treeline. The landing was smooth, the waving of the dark robes concealing any sound that the landing could have made. \n \n `` I was n't trying to-'' Luke started, but stopped as the realization set in. `` Find you? Does that mean you're Master Yoda?'' Luke closed some of the distance he had created between the two of them. `` Then you must know who I am! I was sent here by-'' \n \n `` Sent, yes, I know. By who.'' The creature stared at him intensely. `` To teach. The Jedi way. The way of the Force. Hmm....yes.'' Yoda nodded. `` Yes, I know.'' \n \n Luke had so many questions, but as he stared at the small green *goblin*, he knew not to speak. He had heard many stories of the great Jedi Knight Yoda, one of the last Jedi Masters of the galaxy. He would show patience. \n \n `` Ask you a question, I will'', Yoda spoke. His dark eyes studied Luke as he shuffled around, his cane firmly grasped in his left hand. `` Strongest, what is? Hmm?'' \n \n Luke glanced at the creature, and then focused on the question. He knew this was a question that had more meaning to it than would appear, and he let it sink into his consciousness for a few minutes. The strongest what? Power? The universe itself? But he realized that he was speaking to a Jedi, and with that he associated only one unquestionable power. `` The Force.'' \n \n `` Ahh, the Force. Yes. Many things it is. Powerful? Yes... Undoubtedly. Influence many things it has. A question: Walk with you, the force does, Skywalker?'' \n \n Patience had never been one of his strengths. He planned on contemplating the question longer, but a `` Yes'' had already slipped out of his mouth. As he rested his arms on the sides of his body he looked at Yoda. Yoda stared back. \n \n `` Hmm. Yes, he says. Yes, or no. Both would be wrong.'' Yoda approached him, the cane rhythmically ticking on the mushy moss as it came down with a soft blow. `` Tell me, Skywalker. The force is with you, you say? The strength of the Light side, yes? And the Dark side, too? Hmm?'' \n \n Luke shook his head. `` No... no, of course not. I'm not a Sith.'' \n \n Yoda stopped only a foot away from him, and looked upwards. `` Hmm, no, of course not. A Sith, you're not.'' He poked Luke's shin with his cane. `` When you stepped out of your plane, dread surrounded you. Fear. What did you do? Walked away from it, you did''. Yoda squeezed his eyes nearly shut as he stared at Luke, who stared back, anxiously waiting for what the Yedi Master would say. \n \n `` Learn from the Dark side, you must''.\n"}

Resigning myself to another three hours of pain and mystery, I slouched in the chair as best I could when tied up. Eventually, I heard footsteps at the door, followed by the sound of a key click and rusty hinges. \n \n `` Hello? I know that you've been beating me for hours, and I respect that, but I really have to pee.'' \n \n I must have looked very stupid, what with being blindfolded ( I could make out a soft glow through the cloth ), tied up, and asking for a bathroom break. Instead of granting my request, my blindfold was ripped off. The harsh light from the single bulb in the center of the ceiling was like staring into the sun. I did my best to shut my eyes until they adjusted to the change in light. When I did finally look around, I saw a man and two women standing in front of me. One of the women, who looked very imposing, had clearly been the source of the bruises on my face. Though her hands had been washed, my blood was still on her shirt. \n \n `` So, about that bathroom br-'' \n \n I was rudely interrupted by another blow to my right cheek. Clearly, I was not going to be doing any talking right now, so I resolutely shut the hell up and waited. Thankfully, I did n't have to wait long. \n \n `` Hello, Blees. It's nice to meet you.'' She paused, the blood still dripping from her knuckles, as if waiting for a reply. But before I could muster the courage to speak, she continued: `` Yesterday, you joined our hallowed ranks, and for that, you are to be congratulated. However, ours is not just a group of admins. No, we have a duty to perform, a solemn duty, and it is not for the faint of heart. You have to be able to undergo torture, both physically and mentally, without breaking. You have to be willing to cling to an ideal so strongly that no one can shake your foundation. And you have to be a terrible writer.'' \n \n I was following her rousing speech fairly well, until the end. `` Pardon?'' \n \n My interruption was mercifully not greeted with an assault this time. The man answered my interjection. `` As moderators for \/r\/WritingPrompts, it is our duty to make sure that all the subscribers feel like they can accomplish what other writers can not. That's why we all have to accept the difficult job of writing horrible, awful stories, so other writers can read them and resolve themselves to be better writers.'' \n \n `` But I've seen all the mods write. You all are excellent writers.'' \n \n `` We know,'' replied the other woman, `` but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about actual, published books, about produced movies, about songs and poems and anything mainstream that gets written. We never link our real names and our screennames, so on Reddit, we can be helpful and write what we really want, but in the real world, terrible writing is our cross to bear.'' \n \n `` I... I do n't understand.'' \n \n The woman who had been punching me stepped behind my chair and began to untie the constricting ropes. `` Let me give you an example. You know me as Lexi, but my most popular work is n't The Librarian's Code. It's Fifty Shades of Grey.'' \n \n `` Holy shit!'' I gasped. `` You're E.L. James?'' \n \n `` That's right,'' she sighed, tossing a portion of the rope aside. `` I've made a lot of money from that piece of drivel, but it was excruciating to write.'' \n \n I turned back to the other two admins. `` And you two?'' \n \n `` I'm Keon,'' said the man, `` also known as Uwe Boll.'' \n \n `` KangaRou.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a `` hero '' in a fantasy world , but as you `` adventure '' , you are slowly realizing YOU are the antagonist .\n","story":"The castle was long abandoned by some ancient King, who one day must have realized the advantages of not living on a hill in a forest in the middle of no-where. *But it had it's perks too*, Valerius mused when choosing it as his hideout. The towers made a good lookout over the valley, the interior gave him enough room for training and the townsfolk kept a distance that can only be described as `` superstitiously careful''. Also, the wine-cellar still had a few full casks in it. It was the perfect place for being left alone. \n \n `` Igor?!'' Valerius called into the staircase leading to the maze that made up the castle's interior. \n \n Igor was the one who told Valerius about the castle in the first place. He had met Igor in a small tavern, half a days ride west. He did n't notice him enter the tavern and after Valerius heard about his future hideout, Igor only told him to meet him there. How he got there before Valerius was a mystery, but who was he to hold that against someone? \n \n `` Yees Master?'' It came up the stone halls of the stairway, accompanied by the sound of shuffling footsteps and the emerging light of a candle. Igor looked like Lady Luck had spat him in his face right before his mother dropped him on it. He had short, slim legs that did n't match at all to his round belly and the hunch on his back. The squint teeth and the lazy eye did not help his appearance but he had a gentle soul and was so very eager to help Valerius in his studies, the mage just could n't refuse. \n \n `` I told you not to call me that.'' \n \n `` Call you what, Master?'' Igor asked in his usual cheerful tone. \n \n Valerius rolled his eyes while Igor made his last swaying step to reach the top of the stairs. \n \n `` Good, you brought up those vials. I need you to fetch me a leaf from the Elm in the courtyard, it needs to be fresh, so best take the twig it is hanging on too.'' \n \n `` Of course Master, and afterwards I shall bring you dinner,'' Igor said cheerfully. \n \n `` I still do n't see why you insisted that I take to highest room in this tower, does n't it get to you, to climb up here?'' \n \n `` Not at all Master, I am very light on my feet,'' Igor said while setting the small bottles he brought with him on a nearby table. `` You told me you had important studies, so naturally the best place for this is'the study'. If you were going to bake something we would have used the castles bakery, Master. Its just the proper way to do these things, Master.'' \n \n `` I have not earned the title of'master' yet my friend, first I need to finish this spell. After that you can call me Master as much as you want.'' \n \n `` Understood. I shall bring the rest of your flasks up, so you can continue you work, Master.'' \n \n With that Igor turned and began his painfully slow descent back down to'the infirmary', a small room full of bottles and instruments. In the beginning, when Valerius arrived, he had Igor show him every room, scouring them for anything useful. What Valerius had not expected was that Igor would get him everything *up here* in the exact same order he pointed everything out, those weeks ago. \n \n Valerius was a tall man with his shoulder-long hair tied behind his neck. He wore a long green cloak and a black shirt. The combination gave his seamstress wide eyes and all she said was `` stunning''. Now, a good year later, the best he could hope for would be a `` not too bad...'', but he liked it anyways. In one hand he held a book titled *'' Alchemic Reasoning'' *, in the other hand was a glas of wine Valerius deemed worthy for a king. \n \n His studies were of the supernatural sort: magic, alchemy and their correlation. With magic you could, for example, heal a wound no doctor could fix in an instant and with alchemy you could make a potion to heal the wound in half an hour. The problem with magic was, that only few people could use it. A grievous wound ca n't get treated if you never met a mage in a lifetime. Alchemy on the other hand could be learned by anyone, but the ingredients were expensive and the process of most recopies involved very nearly blowing your house to pieces. So in the end it is very hard to get a healing potion, let alone enough to help more than one person. Valerius' studies tried to combine the two. what if he could make a small flask with healing potion and magically transfer it's alchemic properties to a baller full of water? If he could make this work he would become a Master, maybe even a Gand Master if *the Circle* saw fit. \n \n `` Master! Come quickly, Master!'' Igors voice shrieked up into the tower. Valerius set the book down and hurried down the stairs as fast as he could without spilling his wine. He found Igor by a window in the gallery. The window faced south, usually giving a view of the forest and the castles dry moat. Now it also gave a view of a mob of townspeople behind the moat. \n \n `` That's quite the gathering, what do they want from us?'' \n \n `` Not *'us'*, Master. *You. *'' Igor said without hesitation. \n \n `` But what have I done to deserve pitchforks and torches? How do they even know I am here?'' \n \n `` Well because I told them, Master. The vermin must know about the new Dark Lord, otherwise they would have no respect.'' \n \n For an instance the muffled shouts from outside were swept away by the sound of glass breaking of the cold stone floor. \n \n `` You did WHAT?'' Valerius asked incredulously while shaking the small man a hand-span above the spilled wine. `` Why would you do that?!'' he shouted before turning back to the window, dropping his minion. \n \n `` It is tradition Master. Rule them with an iron fist, the way it is supposed to be,'' Igor announced in a much too happy tone. `` Do n't you meddle in the Dark Arts? It was why fate brought you here, Master.'' \n \n `` *Rule* them? Why would I do that? I have more important matters to attend! And fate? It was n't fate that brought me here, it was YOU!'' The louder Valerius got, the more Igors crooked but happy smile faded from his unshapely lips. \n \n `` But Master, I am only here to help. I bring you your trinkets, I clean the castle, I collected the taxes, I ma-'' \n \n `` *TAXES? *'' The mage roared. `` Why would..'' He was both angry and at a loss for words. \n \n `` I got them yesterday, with the full moon. This is the proper way, Master, it is how it has always been. How it should be.'' Igor said with less certainty. With more strength he then said `` I help the Master, I am a good servant.'' \n \n `` No Igor! You have been a bad servant. I'll go upstairs to talk to them, you go and get them their money.'' \n \n And as the Master of the castle hurried away, Igor was left there, standing in a puddle he suddenly had no desire to tidy up anymore. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n Hey, first promt I did.

I realized as I looked up that something was wrong. The skin wasn \u2019 t right it was grey and leathery. I pulled my hand out of their pocket only to realize something was coming out with it. Something that I thought I had left in their pocket. As my hand came into view, there was a slowly beating heart now attached to it. I didn \u2019 t have time for fear because it was too late. My body slowly changed to match his; I became grey and leathery as I put the heart into my pocket. It was almost as if it needed a new host, like the other host was used up. Suddenly I realized something; that even though I was moving it was against my will. It was the same walk that I looked for when I pickpocketed someone. It was really odd; there was a set pattern that was always the same. Up and down the same street over and over. I didn \u2019 t realize it at the time, but my skin was becoming darker and darker grey and I had a strange urge for blood, almost as if that was what it craved. It was what it craved, but my blood was the sustenance. It was maybe two hours before I noticed the same walk I did. Another victim was unknowingly walking into its trap. There was a shiver down my spine as the pickpocketer reached into my pocket and grabbed the heart not stopping to think like I did. As he pulled it out I realized I wasn \u2019 t moving anymore. I found I was frozen, and my body felt really heavy. As a bus passed by, I caught a glimpse of myself and I had become a statue. I was one of the same statues that I had admired over the past month for being so realistic. Was this some sort of sick experiment messing with my mind? As I stayed there, there were constant murmurs of approval at how lifelike the statue was and I wanted to scream.

She was nothing special, plain in face and in personality but she needed a father for her bastard son and Johann needed a home. \n \n Mill work was n't a lucrative business, Johann had only barely enough money for the new Sunday's he was wearing.

It seemed I would n't be getting out, not without a fight. \n \n Just as I finished, a quite tune played, and the door dissipated into dust, along with the trap tunes I played onto it earlier. \n A man slowly walked in.

Unless'', I smirked,'' it has begun''? I kept my eyes locked with his. To my surprise, he gave a small, slightly sad smile. \n `` There has indeed risen more and more heretics like yourself ever since that day. Is that what you wanted? Was that what you were hoping to achieve when you humiliated my father for the first time?'' \n `` I wanted my friends... My brothers, to be free of tyranny. Music is more than just a tool. Music is an expression of the soul. And if ones soul longs for music other then Rock or Metal, who is your father to deny them that? Who is anybody to deny them that??!'' \n The prince sighed, and the smile on his face got sadder. \n `` You really think that is what you did? Make them free? No'' he said, his voice becoming more cold, with an undernote of anger `` You made us all weaker. Do you remember the K-Pop wars? You know how we repelled them? It was n't just through our music - it was through our unity! Every singer, every drummer, down to the last maintenance member - they all believed in our way.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Humans and machines have gone to war . The machines think they 're winning , as they can decode every encryption known to man , but little do they know of the humans ' actual method for communication ... sarcasm .\n","story":"*First time poster, please be gentle: ) * \n \n We \u2019 ve been at war with the machines for two years now, fighting a war that no one could ever have predicted. We designed the robots to fight for us, so we created what would become our worst nightmare when they inevitably turned against us. They are strong, and outgun us by far. We would be fighting a losing battle if not for our secret weapon; we are smarter than machines. \n \n So, we fight back the only way we can, by winning the intelligence war. One of the men who designed the AI in the first place is still alive, and still on our side. He explained to us that the machines \u2019 way of thinking is completely logical. They don \u2019 t understand humor, metaphors or most importantly, sarcasm. We communicate over encrypted channels, which gets the machines \u2019 attention. They are very good at decrypting things, but they don \u2019 t understand that we know they \u2019 re listening. They don \u2019 t understand that we don \u2019 t mean what we are saying. \n \n We \u2019 re planning a massive ambush today. As senior lieutenant of the UNGDF, it falls to me to hold the conference with my squad captains \u201c informing \u201d them of what we plan to. After all, the machines will only believe the ruse if a senior officer is conveying the information. \n \n \u201c Are you sure this channel is secure, Lieutenant? \u201d asked squad captain Jones. \u201c Affirmative. \u201d I replied, \u201c It has been encrypted to the best of our abilities. \u201d \u201c So what \u2019 s the plan, sir? \u201d asked squad captain Morgan. \n \n I took a deep breath, gained my composure and said: \u201c The soldiers on the American front are in desperate need of supplies. They are expecting an extremely large shipment of Rations, Medical supplies, arms and ammunition which is leaving from Great Britain at 0500 hours 3 days from now. It is estimated that the shipment will contain approximately 150,000 tons of supplies, which will aid in turning the tide of the American war effort. Our job is to escort the shipment to its destination safely. I \u2019 d like a dispatch of 150 men to reinforce naval officers on board the HMS Subterfuge \u201d \n \n \u201c But sir, \u201d said Jones \u201c Won \u2019 t that be vulnerable to torpedo attacks by the enemy \u2019 s sub nautical forces? \u201d I smiled. This was it. The culmination of weeks of misinformation and planning. \u201c No, \u201d I said. \u201c The Navy have performed a comprehensive redesign and renovation of the HMS Subterfuge. At this point, its only vulnerability is exposure to oil-based paint. \u201d \n \n EDIT: Thanks so much for the feedback everyone. Writing is n't something I do often, so I really appreciate the support and constructive criticism. Also, I fixed an oversight as to the size of the shipment to make the idea of 150 men defending it more plausible, as well as some minor punctuation and grammar. Thanks again!: ) \n STM\n"}

But as the accidents piled up, eventually the connection was made. Every clock in the world had simultaneously changed its time by five minutes, depending on the owner's gender. \n \n Once this was figured out, most of the scheduling issues were swiftly resolved. Men set their clocks back five minutes, women forward five minutes. Confusion at how it had happened still abounded, but for the most part everything was back to normal. \n \n So the world thought. Not all had forgotten, however. Not all were content to let it fade into the background. They had been triggered. The universe itself had misgendered them all. Within a week the Transgender Revolution began. Transgendereds of all descriptions and pronouns took up arms against whoever or whatever had caused the shift. Soon, cis scum, transphobic servants of the patriarchy, and other shitlords were being slaughtered in the streets by the throngs of variously-gendered revolutionaries. \n \n None could stand in their way. Any who tried were publicly shamed, accused of being transphobics, male supremacists, and neo-Nazis. They were against gender equality, and endorsed sexism.

To still have intelligent conversations with either of my parents, when they were both over ninety years old, it was almost unheard of. Neither of them had gone through so much as a small skip in their heart beats or an irregular shadow on a PET scan, or at least they had n't since my dad was fifty-six. \n Thirty seven years ago today, my father was lying on his death bed.

So I left, I needed to do something, even though the doctors assured me there was nothing to be done. I refused to believe it, fifty-six and he was going to die? Not today, I wouldn \u2019 t let it happen. I cried out to heaven and hell, HE answered first. So I struck a deal. I thought I covered everything; both my parents were in the deal. I wouldn \u2019 t let my mother die as soon as I saved my father. My parents would never get sick, not even a cold, but someone had to get sick in their place. Someone else \u2019 s parents. I would only remember the deal on this day.

I cried and I pleaded but HE said my son had already been chosen. I told him I wanted the deal to be over; HE told me early cancellation had its price. \u201c What is the price? \u201d I asked. \u201c I saved your father thirty seven years ago today. He would have died the very next day had it not been for me \u201d HE said. HE still had that tortured look of glee on his face. It made me sick. \u201c Your father will die tomorrow, but even in death he will not have escaped.

John said as we approached enemy territory. \n \n `` The scent is weak, there's almost no sign of life. I believe we can proceed forward without fear.'' Micheal said this with the confidence only a veteran soldier can know. \n \n `` Stay close and tight we do n't know what to expect, this colony is fairly new. We've been sent to gather intelligence not endanger our lives.'' I spoke to my team of five. We had never encountered an enemy mound before. We had lived in peace for years. No danger, no hostility, we were a large colony with no need to fear a mound of this size. Why was the queen so worried? \n \n `` Peter, I do n't know how to feel about this. This mound looks only weeks old. It dismal in size, what happened to this place...'' Aaron spoke with fear. He was a young soldier assigned to our watch. I had no answers for him. \n \n We were a small recon team of five. John, Michael, Aaron, Kyle and myself. This was my mission and I was not about to fail my queen, even if this was just a small recon job. The mound was small still under the rubble of the earth. This colony should have been thriving but all we see is a single entrance. We proceed with caution, entering the mound, no life in sight. \n \n `` This is primitive! The tunnels have no support and the corridors only allow for one or two ants to proceed without issue.'' Kyle spoke with only the knowledge a former architect would know. He was to help us navigate to search these... ruins of a mound. \n \n The place was in shambles as we proceeded deeper underground. Tunnels shut, collapsed with no other entrance or exit. The deeper we go the tunnels become larger, more intricate only resembling what should have been a thriving community. Dinning halls and daycare's empty and ruins left in it's place. What happened to these ants? \n \n `` Help me...'' We hear a whimper coming from across the dining hall. A lone soldier is all we see, at least whats left of him. His body is missing half his limbs, burned and torn apart by god knows what. I've never seen such a thing. \n \n `` What happened here!'' Aaron spoke as he raised his pincers to the young soldiers head. Merely a boy, his pincers not even the size of his head, young and dying. \n \n `` Stand down.'' I spoke now before we lost the first and possibly last sign of life we might come across. \n \n `` But he's enemy! We ca n't spare him!'' He objected. \n \n `` He's all we have to go by!'' Kyle was speaking up after having walked and inspected every inch of space he could lay his eyes on. \n \n `` This place is in ruins! There's signs of flooding, collapsed pillars, structural damage not possible by mere architectural design. This ant may have the answers we seek! The queen sent us here for a reason, maybe he knows!'' Kyle had a look about him that I had never seen across his face before. Fear, fear and curiosity. \n \n John walked over to this boy. `` What happened here.'' The medic spoke and adjusted the boys body and attempted to see if anything could be done to heal his body. \n \n Up till now we were just exploring, now we were afraid, we did not what what awaited us until the boy spoke. \n \n `` It was an act of a god.'' He could barley speak and he tells us of gods! \n \n `` First it was floods... almost daily. The golden floods that would set us back, it was only the begining. Mere setbacks, the floods would collapse our tunnels and slow down our forces, not nearly enough to set us back this far.'' He spoke with a pained expression. How long had this been going on? \n \n `` They continued day after day and came to a stop... we thought we would be okay. It was followed only days later by storms... hurricane winds with so much strength that it was like silver pincers would slice our mound down to nothing! It destroyed our mound reduced it to nothing but what you see now!'' He coughed in pain, he would not last much longer. John could find no remedy to an ant with half a missing torso. \n \n `` What happened to you soldier. Why are you like this?'' I finally spoke I needed to learn more. This boy was on the verge of death, barely conscious but he continued. \n \n `` W-w-we did all we could, traveled the surface, observed the stars! But the fire came last, first it was like the sun was attacking us individually... it got me first. It took half of me and that's why I was put here... away... too deep to be bothered. My brothers were not so lucky. The last I was was liquid fire that destroyed us! I'm luck to be alive.'' He was tired and we were all speechless. \n \n Suddenly we felt vibrations, the whole mound began to shake. \n \n `` Whats going on!?'' Kyle shouted. \n \n `` Defensive positions now!'' Micheal was doing his duty trying to get us back on track. \n \n `` Oh god not again!'' The boy panicked and trashed trying to get away attempting to walk for freedom from what came next. \n \n `` Hold steady team we do n't know whats coming!'' We raised our pincers ready for anything. \n \n `` It's them again they've come back for the queen and I!'' The boy continued to shout. \n \n `` What is it? Who is doing this?!'' I shouted back, I was afraid. \n \n `` I-I-It's a... Human.'' He spoke his last words as a white dust stormed filled the tunnels. The mound was overcome with this storm as it tore our skin and broke our armor. I felt this storm rip through me and steal my team. \n \n I had failed my queen and my team. I could feel my skin dry out and tear away at me. My queen is in danger and I could n't even tell her of the danger coming. \n \n The Human. \n\n"}

When it all began, the army would crush the rebels but each defeat only fuled their cause and soon, they had an army of their own, nobility had begun supporting their cause, providing weapons, trained men and supplies and as the war raged on, more nobels allied with the rebellion.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A detective makes a deal with Death . He has 48 hours to discover the who , what and why of a murder case , and if he does he can bring the victim back .\n","story":"The cigarette smoke curled lazily up towards the ceiling and I watched it twist and curl as it sat in the ashtray. I took a long drag on my cigarette and exhaled slowly, and watched the smoke leave my mouth and fill the already hazy office. I stared down hard at the cigarette in the ashtray, freshly lit and the one I was supposed to be smoking; at least that had been the plan until the dame walked into my office, Jack Mason, P.I. The dame had been unexpected, and I had made a mistake. I didn \u2019 t like making mistakes so early in a job because it usually meant that I was going to wind up paying the doctor another 2am call after being freshly ventilated by a 2 cent hoodlum. \n \n I had three reasons including the cigarette for why I didn \u2019 t like the broad sitting across from me. The second reason involved my booked solid evening with a half-empty bottle of bourbon and the dirty glass I kept in my lower desk drawer beside my.38 special. I had a hot date with that bourbon, and I didn \u2019 t appreciate having to cancel. \n \n The third reason I didn \u2019 t like the broad had nothing to do with how she was dressed or her demeanor. She was wearing a modest skirt, floral blouse with a matching hat and a cute little lace number pulled over her eyes. Her gloves were lily white, just like her modesty, and her body would make a grown man sweat; I know because I was looking at it. \n \n Unfortunately, I also knew that she was dead; hence the cigarette. Big Tom Caldwell, the Sparrow, had worked her over good when he found out she was planning to sing a pretty little song to the judge about his import-export business. I \u2019 m sure it would \u2019 ve been quite the performance, but Caldwell sent two men to buy out all the tickets, and her last performance was to an empty ally and a stray cat. Not quite the star-studded venue she had hoped for, I \u2019 m sure. \n \n At least, that \u2019 s what the black market rumor mill was saying, and I had bought it up till ten minutes ago, when she rolled into my office like a moonlit fog in a bad horror flick. All flash, and flare, and foreboding, but I hoped without any substance. I resisted the urge to see if I could throw something through her. \n \n I put the cigarette down and reached down to the drawer where my date lay waiting patiently. \u201c So Judy, \u201d I began tentatively, \u201c What brings you here? \u201d \n \n \u201c Hello Jack, \u201d she finally said; her voice a coarse whisper. I figured it must \u2019 ve been the work-over her larynx got before she sang her last so I smiled politely and waited for her to continue. After a moment, she did, \u201c Is that all you have to say to me, \u2018 What brings you here? \u2019 \u201d \n \n Finding the bottle and glass, I pulled them both out and poured myself a healthy level. I paused briefly and considered that, given the circumstances, I should probably be watching my health, so I poured a bit more. \u201c I \u2019 m not sure what else I should be saying, Judy. \u201d \n \n \u201c You could always try, \u2018 Hi Jude, how \u2019 s my little match-head doing? \u2019 \u201d She smiled, and I could just make out her smile underneath the lace face-cover. I grimaced. Her teeth were cracked, and I finally decided that it wasn \u2019 t a new shade of lipstick smeared across her lips. \n \n \u201c Alright, \u2018 Hi Jude, how \u2019 s my little match-head doing, \u2019 \u201d I whispered as I took a strong sip of my medicine. \n \n \u201c Better, but it still leaves a lot to be desired, \u201d she said as she slowly reached into her purse. She pulled out a pack of cigarettes and fiddled with the package. After a moment, she pulled one out, held it out towards me, and added, \u201c Got a light? \u201d \n \n I picked up the lighter and calmly lit her cigarette, trying with everything in my being to not have my hands shake like some cop fresh on the beat. I had seen some weird stuff in my time, but I did have to admit that this one was new. She puffed for a moment on the cigarette before leaning away and looking up at me, \u201c I have a job for you, Jack. \u201d \n \n \u201c So do most people who walk through that door, \u201d I said coldly, \u201c But how can you have a job for me, Jude, you \u2019 re dead. \u201d I puffed again on my own cigarette as I eyed her suspiciously. She continued to sit, and so I again ran through my mind that perhaps this was just a good make-up job and a sick joke by one of the boys back when I was on the force. Hell, I could even see this being some sort of gag by ole Johnny back in the old platoon; he always had a sick sense of humor. \n \n \u201c Am I? \u201d she finally asked coyly, the rasp to her voice giving it a bigger air of gravitas than I \u2019 m sure she had intended. \n \n I leaned forward in my chair and stubbed out my half-finished cigarette. Then I picked up the glass of medicine, and downed the rest of the bourbon. Pouring myself another full measure, I pulled out another cigarette and lit that one up, hoping for a fresh taste. \n \n I jabbed my finger in her direction and spoke harshly, \u201c Look, Jude, or whoever you are, sure we had a good thing going, but then you chose to sing for the judge on Big Tom and he smoked you. \u201d I took a long drag and lowered my voice, \u201c Used your head like the tympani from the London Symphony; heard it was quite the number he played in that alley. So whoever, or whatever you are, please get the hell out of my office. \u201d \n \n We both sat there in silence for several minutes before she slowly reached up with her hand and pulled back the veil over her face. I gasped; it was Judy, there was no mistaking it. No amount of make-up job could disguise someone else like her. The only thing was that her eyes were different, and that exotic Irish green was replaced by a dull black. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re wrong about something, Jack, \u201d she whispered as small flecks of blood flew out of her mouth and oozed at the corners of her mouth. That was when I realized the veil hadn \u2019 t been to trick me; it had been to keep the blood off the floor. \u201c Big Tom didn \u2019 t have me killed. \u201d \n \n I stuttered for a few moments before I found words, but even those came difficult, \u201c But\u2014but I\u2014but Jude that \u2019 s just impossible. Word on the street is Big Tom ordered your hit for going two-faced. 5,000 bucks was placed on your head and somebody cashed in on it. \u201d \n \n \u201c But it wasn \u2019 t Big Tom, \u201d she said as she took a long drag on her cigarette, leaving more lipstick on the butt. \n \n \u201c Then who else? What else were you involved in, Judy, \u201d I demanded as I stood up and leaned over the desk at her. \u201c You were one of his girls, working in the bars; you and I both know that, so who else could \u2019 ve ordered the hit? \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t know, Jack, \u201d she whispered, \u201c I just know it wasn \u2019 t Big Tom. \u201d \n \n \u201c How don \u2019 t you know? \u201d I shouted, becoming frustrated with the entire situation. I was talking to a dead dame who was telling me she wasn \u2019 t killed by the person who killed her but someone else who apparently wanted her dead in some sort of shadow-play-I-don \u2019 t-know-what. \n \n Another drag, another puff of smoke, and she finally said, \u201c I don \u2019 t know because I \u2019 m not Judy. Not really at least. I \u2019 m only partially here. \u201d I sat back down and waited as she continued, \u201c I have a deal to offer you; from Death. \u201d \n \n \u201c Death? As in, Grim Reaper, Death? \u201d \n \n \u201c The same one. He is giving you the chance to find out who really killed me, and he will bring me back to life in return. \u201d She smiled and looked up at me, and I couldn \u2019 t help but shudder slightly at the darkness of her eyes. \n \n \u201c Free and clear? \u201d I asked, scratching my chin to distract myself. \n \n \u201c Free and clear, \u201d she whispered. \n \n I nodded for a moment, and mulled it over; an offer to bring back the lovely Judy, my number one gal, and have another chance at that happy life we had dreamed about before she died in that alley. This was entirely too good to be true, or somebody had slipped some opium into my bourbon without me noticing. \u201c So what \u2019 s the catch, \u201d I finally asked. \n \n \u201c You only have 48 hours, \u201d she said even more quietly than usual. \n \n I blanched to be perfectly honest. It was hard to set up a good henchman workover without at least 24 hours \u2019 notice, and Death had only give me 48 to solve this crime to get my girl back? Something smelled rotten, so I turned over the lid to find out what, \u201c Why? Why would Death make ME this offer? What \u2019 s in it for him? \u201d \n \n Judy frowned and dragged on the last of her cigarette. She reached over into the ashtray and gently stubbed it out before she looked up at me again, \u201c Because someone found something they weren \u2019 t supposed to, ever, and for the first time in a very, very long time, Death is afraid. He \u2019 s making you this deal because you \u2019 re the only one with any interest in putting a stop to it. \u201d \n \n I mulled it over for a moment, and decided she might be right. Judy was an estranged orphan, both her parents died during the War on a torpedoed hospital boat; no other real family. I also couldn \u2019 t deny my interest; dead people asking me to take a case from Death himself? What other surprises awaited me in the dark alleyways? What sort of mess was I getting wrapped up into? \n \n \u201c Alright, \u201d I finally whispered, \u201c I \u2019 ll take the case. \u201d \n \n -- -- \n \n r\/grenadiere42\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write a normal-sounding story , but slowly turn it from normal to completely batshit insane .\n","story":"Chase gripped his steering wheel with his left hand, adjusting the steering wheel with his right. The motion was made uncomfortable by the suit he was wearing; he knew he should have taken the jacket off before he headed out. A familiar tune buzzed through static, and he slowly turned the knob until it came in clear. His head bobbed in time with he song, and he started humming as he sped down the highway, on his way to a promising job interview. \n \n As he came around a bend in the road, blue and red lights flickered in the distance ahead. Chase checked his speed, and continued onward; only to find that they had the entire highway blocked off. He pulled off to the side, trying to see what was keeping him from advancing, but could n't see a thing. \n \n An officer knocked on Chase's window, making him jump and hit his head. Chase laughed; the officer did n't. After rolling down the window, Chase inquired, `` What's going on up there? Some kind of accident?'' \n \n The officer wore a stern look on his face. `` I need you to go, sir. Turn around, and go.'' \n \n `` Back the way I came? But it's the wrong way.'' \n \n `` Do n't worry about that, just get --'' \n \n ***BANG. *** \n \n An explosion came from the distance, and the officer ran towards it without saying another word. Chase put his car in gear, and started to turn around. Before he could get on his way, the ground started to rumble beneath his vehicle. Cracks appeared in the asphalt, and Chase panicked -- he got out of his vehicle and ran to the grass. Just as he exited the roadway, flames spat from the cracks, and he watched as his car went up in flames. \n \n Gunshots rang out in he distance, the direction of the cops; so Chase ran in that direction. Surely, they could help him. He passed through the blockade of cruisers, and ran towards a line of officers, guns drawn and pointed towards a plume of black smoke. He opened his mouth to call out, but became speechless as a beast emerged from the smoke. It stood at least fifteen feet tall, horns twisting from its head, it's gorilla-like body covered in blood red scales and spots of black fur. The police shot at it, accomplishing nothing; it swung its arm and sent officers flying in every direction. \n \n An arm landed next to Chase, still clutching a gun. He pried the fingers open, and ran up the hill to his right, hoping the beast did n't see him. The air grew hotter, and the sky turned red in a matter of moments. Black clouds seemed to swirl in the atmosphere. At the top of the hill, Chase emerged to find the world ablaze; smoke and destruction in every apparent direction. He did n't know what to do, where to go. He just knew he had to get away, and fast. \n \n Suddenly, he heard a shriek behind him, and turned to see a small creature -- the size of a small child, with leathery, deep red skin and jet black eyes -- barreling towards him. It bared three-inch long razor sharp teeth, and outstretched its claws as it approached -- Chase quickly rose the gun and fired as it came within inches of his face. The bullet entered directly between its eyes, and blew out the back of its skull. \n \n `` Well... At least they die easy enough.'' Chase turned and ran towards the city. \n \n His first stop was a local convenient store; he needed weapons and ammo. He ran into a few more demons inside, disposing of them quickly as he made his way to the hunting section. The place was cleaned out; people had clearly had more of a head start than he did. I the corner, however, much to his surprise, was a machete. He smiled, picked it up, and ran out of the store. \n \n The ground shook once more as he exited the store. He found himself surrounded by a dozen of the demons; and the larger one was roaming in he distance, tearing people in half. The demons rushed him all at once. He shot the first in the head, using his last bullet, then turned to his right and threw the gun at another, stunning it momentarily. He drew his machete, spun around, and effortlessly sliced the head off another; after which he darted forward, shoving the blade through the skull of two more. He felt a slash at his back, and twisted around in time to see one lunge at him, knocking him to the ground. He shoved his fingers in its eye sockets, reaching for his machete, inches away from his fingertips. With a burst of adrenaline, he swung at its face, sending it rolling to the ground; allowing him to grab his blade and drive it through its heart. The remains demons were easily dispatched. \n \n Covered in blood and sore to the bone, Chase looked at the destruction around him. A fiery beast glided through the scorched sky, and skyscraper in the distance crumbled. Sirens blew from every direction, screams and gunfire were abundant. To his left was the gigantic beast, about a hundred yards away; to his right, a mass of smaller demons. \n \n He gripped his machete tight, took a deep breath, and ran to his right. \n \n\n"}

Waldo Handford, who's father's been searching for him for over twenty seven years, has been a Portland resident, locals say, for the past fifteeeeen'' \n \n The reporter opens the glass door into the shop and walks unobstructed toward a rather angst driven thirty- something. \n \n `` Good morning mister Handford'' \n \n The scruffy gentleman looked as if he had n't bathed in over twenty years.

And for the sake of the public and your family-'' \n \n Tears painted Waldo's cheeks. Cheeks that had lost their rose decades ago. Waldo's shock at the words betrayed his initial steely demeanor. \n \n `` Family.'' \n \n The word burned his tongue. A thing only the warm and the comforted tend to mention. A part of a vocabulary that was no longer his. \n \n `` Yes, Mr. Handf-'' \n \n `` I left. That's all there is to know. I did n't belong there.'' \n \n The tears ran dry and his eyes returned to a stoic shade. The reporter latched onto the emotion and desperately worded his interrogation. \n \n `` What was left behind, Mr. Handford?'' \n \n Waldo took off his cap and warmed his fingers in it. He stared at the tattered remains of the brilliant crimson and cream strip lines that once cohabited the now graying fabric. A breath swept into him as he placed it back atop his stuck, greasy black hair. \n \n `` Just that name, nothing else.'' \n \n And at that, Waldo walked.\n"}

It was covered in the red dust so we had to wipe it off only to see something horrifying. At first it was just red, but as we got to the corners, we could see some yellow, then we saw it. It looked like a flag. \n My partner and I wanted to go in badly, but couldn \u2019 t until we got confirmation. After a while of arguments between staff and others but they finally gave us permission. \n The pod door opened with a woosh sound of air flowing out. We got in to see a carnage of materials, notebooks, and clothes flung around. There was some type of creatures there. We were given directions not to touch them though, as they could be contaminated. There was also computers, so we decided to look through them. \n It had no password so we got on easily and opened a summary of the people on the vessel. After looking through we saw the species of these creatures, they were called\u2026 humans. \n\n"}

However , upon arriving at the Dragon 's Keep , you learn the Princess was not kidnapped , but instead is a runaway .\n","story":"Riding above the setting sun came a man atop a large ashen horse. The animal bore the weight of its master as well as several sacks of food, ale, and the mans weapon, shield, and armor. \n \n A large linden round shield adorned the riders back; its once brightly painted sigil of a raging direwolf now faded after years of use. Sword and ax straddled his side and his bow and arrows were safely stored in one of his packs. \n \n Coming up on a grassy knoll, he could see the landmark he had been riding for; the Black Dragons Den. Once a great keep built along a now crumbling wall bordering two ancient kingdoms, the infamous Black Dragon had taken up residence in its abandoned walls in recent times. \n \n Everyone knew of the monstrosities that the dragon inflicted upon mankind whenever it left its lair. The beast was privy to setting entire villages aflame, consuming whole herds of farm animals, and, more recently, kidnapping King Cyneric's daughter; Primula. \n \n Nearly a year ago, the black dragon flew into Dagenham and wreaked havoc upon the inhabitants. The city's garrison did the best they could to fell the monster, but ultimately their efforts were fruitless. The dragon razed half the city to the ground, gorged itself on hundreds of people, and eventually flew for the kings keep. The beast tore through the castle walls after some effort, entered the castle walls, clutched the princess in it's nasty claws, and then proceeded to fly back to its lair. \n \n In the aftermath of the dragons debauchery, the king spared no expense at trying to rescue his daughter. He raised his entire personal levy as well as those of his vassals and rode for the dragons lair. They were quickly slaughtered upon arrival. King Cyneric and few hundred men managed to escape the dragons wrath, but the rest were n't as fortunate. \n \n Upon arriving back home safe and sound, the king immediately began drafting any able bodied man in his kingdom to take up arms and march for the dragons lair with an incentive of unfathomable riches and marriage to his daughter for whoever slayed the beast. Despite this, only a few thousand answered his call. Nevertheless, the king once again went off to deal with the beast. Once again he was beaten handily. This time, however, he returned to Dagenham with a charred backside and but a few dozen men. \n \n With no one willing to answer his call for a third march on the dragons lair, King Cyneric was left with little choice but to turn to men of hire. That's where Sigeberht came in. \n \n Now descending the lowly hill, Sigeberht mounted off his horse and set up camp in the cover of some thick foliage. He would rest for the night before engaging the beast come dawn. \n *** \n \n `` Sigeberht, your exploits are legendary. From here to the walls of Anaheim tales of your adventures are known to every man, woman, and child. They say even the birds sing of your deeds. You're a living legend. There is no man alive as skilled as you.'' \n \n `` You honor me, your majesty,'' Sigeberht began. `` But while my deeds be mighty and my skills unmatched, I do none of it for free.'' \n \n Cyneric chuckled aloud at that. `` That is true. It is also known to every man, woman, and child that you are a man of coin first and foremost. If the pay is n't right, you wo n't even consider doing the job.'' \n \n `` Aye,'' Sigeberht responded. `` So what're you offering me to rescue your daughter?'' \n \n `` I offer you nobility. And with nobility all the perks that go with it. You'll be elevated to the highest title possible without giving you my crown. That is the title of Duke. I'll provide you with a fetching noblewoman of prestige to marry and endow you with enough wealth for you to retire from the lifestyle you currently live. What say you, Sigeberht? Will you rescue my daughter from the clutches of the vile beast?'' \n \n `` Make that fetching noblewoman your daughter and we have a deal.'' \n \n The king was taken aback by the high demand. `` I offer you luxury of the world and yet you still ask for the heavens above! I have but one child. That is my dearest Primula. Whoever weds her will be wedding into royalty. And you are n't of noble stock.'' \n \n `` Then I guess your daughter is doomed,'' Sigeberht said as he began to walk away. `` Have fun dealing with the dragon. Maybe he'll marry her and be your new son-in-law.'' \n \n `` Wait,'' yelled the king just as Sigeberht was making for the exit. `` I yield. There is no one more suit for the task than you. I ca n't afford not to hire you. You will wed my Primula as a just reward for her rescue.'' \n \n `` Good,'' he spoke aloud before exiting. \n *** \n \n Sigeberht awoke from his slumber with an inaudible yawn. Rising to his full height, he unpacked his arms and armor and began to gear up. \n \n A simple steel helmet adorned his head. Lamelar armor draped over a suit of chain mail dressed his body. Sword and ax were sheated on his side, bow and arrows lined his back, and his round shield was held firmly by his left hand. \n \n Once he was fully geared, he ate a simple meal of salted rabbit and ale before praying to the Allfather. \n \n Kneeling on one knee, Sigeberht closed his eyes and raised his arms at full length above his head. Whispering a simple prayer, he did n't spend too much time before rising up and heading for the beasts lair. \n *** \n Will finish this up later. Have to jet off to work right now. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're teaching a class where one of the ten year olds threatens you with voodoo .\n","story":"I sighed. \n `` Mr. Boudreaux, this neither the time nor the place for your antics. 10 points from Ravenclaw,'' I scolded, looking down my glasses at the transfer student. \n \n `` Professor, that ai n't fair! Ms. Henry dropped her wand and I was just tryna help her out!'' the boy protested in his thick Louisiana accent, indignation radiating off him. The young, blonde, eleven year old seated to his right blushed when he said her name. \n \n I pushed my glasses up and fixed a stern gaze on him. Ever since an American wizard visiting London had captured the latest big Dark Wizard ( a former Ravenclaw whose appreciation for creative hexes got slightly out of hand when he slaughtered a sleepy village in Burgundy ), there had been a sustained effort to get more exchange students from the colonies. Most were perfectly fine students. The transfers from the Salem Academy were noted for their grace and skill in duels. The Detroit Warlock Institute was less respectable, but their students got along well with others. The students from the New Orleans Academy of Wizardry, Witchcraft, and Alternate Magicks were notorious though. The transfers were precocious, ambitious, and more than a little ruthless. They were also trained from a young age in types of magic not practiced anywhere else. These proclivities included blood magic, ritualistic sacrificial magic, and Voodoo. These magics held strong negative connotations as being dark, or at least distasteful among the more civilized wizards at Hogwarts, but captured the imagination of the more... morally loose. \n \n The unique culture of the southern colonies led to an even more unique upbringings for these young wizards and witches. The simplest way to tell one of these wizards from the rest was by the large knives they typically carried strapped to their side to aide them in preparing sacrifices or performing ritualistic voodoo. A knife much like the one whose pommel Allen Boudreaux was now stroking, a dark glint in his eyes. \n \n `` Boudreaux, I recommend you leave that knife in its sheathe. You are ten. I am the dueling coach at the most prestigious Wizarding school in the world. I could melt the skin from your bones in a matter of seconds,'' I threatened, trying for lazily confident, hitting arrogantly overbearing instead. As long as I hid the pang of nerves in my stomach, arrogance was okay. Boudreaux seriously gave me the creeps. \n \n The other kids from the NOAWWAM gave him a wide berth. A Slytherin had tried to put him in a full body bind earlier in the year ( a favorite pasttime of second and third years towards first years ) and the young Slytherin wound up in the infirmary for months. Boudreaux's repertoire of destructive and offensive spells was far too high for a student who should still be struggling to shoot different coloured sparks. Normally, I'd be all over him to duel for Hogwarts ( our pre-teen squad lost to Durmstrang's last year in international play ), but again, the kid truly gives me the creeps. \n \n He squinted at me. He opened his mouth to speak, and Ms. Henry, a cute Ravenclaw with no precision in wand movement, put a hand on his arm and lightly squeezed. He glanced at her and relaxed, his shoulders falling, and brow unfurling. I breathed a sigh of relief on the inside and turned back to the board to watch the chalk write for me. \n \n `` Expelliarmus,'' I said slowly, sounding out each syllable. `` It's a simple disarming spell, but one that has helped out many wizards in a jam. A wandless wizard is one whose power has no outlet. Very few wizards are capable of magic without their wand to direct magic, so this is the first spell in many duelists, aurors, and mages repertoire.'' \n \n I turned to the class as I heard a young voice shout the spell. My wand, held loosely in my hand went flying. The chalk fell to the ground and broke. Boudreaux smiled as he caught my wand in his hand. His eyes, so brown they looked black, flashed at me. Some of the class laughed, others looked concerned, worried about what was about to happen. Whether they were concerned about me or their classmate, I do not know. \n \n `` Boudreaux,'' I said in the calmest tone I could muster, `` that was highly inappropriate.'' I privately marveled at his ability to perform the spell after hearing it once and without any notes on the best wand patterns to focus it. \n \n `` I was just practicin', Professor Redman,'' the boy replied, the `` G's'' as absent from his casual style of speech as ever. One would think that would have an effect on his spellcasting, but the child was a prodigy. \n \n `` Well, you obviously have the hang of it,'' I replied, `` Now hand me my wand.'' I reached out my hand. He extended his hand as well, but just as I touched my wand, he dropped it. It clattered against the floor. Ten inches, hippogriff feather core. I felt the blood rush to my face. The little bastard smiled slowly, exposing his small teeth. My class laughed, as I slowly bent over to pick up my wand. \n \n `` Oh, whoops, sorry, Professor,'' he extended his apology with wide, innocent eyes and his best shot at good nature. `` Guess you ai n't as fast as I thought,'specially for such a famous duelist.'' \n \n His comment rankled me. I was offered my post at Hogwarts after being defeated by the new world champion duelist in an tournament seven years ago. The new champion, a deceptively quick witch from Mahoutokoro got the drop on me by sneaking a body bind hex on me before I could cast a protective charm. There's no more humiliating to lose a bout than on your face. \n \n `` I may not be as fast as in my youth, but I am still one of the world's premiere duelists.'' Pride dripped into my voice. \n \n `` Ever heard of voodoo, Professor?'' Boudreaux asked casually. \n \n `` Of course.'' I nodded slowly, interested despite myself. \n \n `` Well, my pappy always told me the most important thing to remember about voodoo is preparation. See, the magic is done way before you actually do anything with it.'' His lips pursed as if trying to remember. `` You have to collect some kinda DNA, make a doll, perform the spell.'' his voice dropped so low I had to lean in to hear him. Our eyes were locked together as the background seemed far away. \n \n `` After that, it do n't matter when you do it. I could get some of your hair today to break your back on your eightieth birthday. I could slit your throat a thousand miles away.'' I could n't control the goosebumps spreading down my arms. The kid's voice was eerily deep and his confidence was terrifying. \n \n `` Well, thank you for the lesson, but you've wasted enough class today,'' I declared with confidence I did not feel. `` 200 points from Ravenclaw for the disruption.'' He bit back a remark and sat down with the urging of Ms. Henry. He slouched in his chair, arms crossed, for the remainder of class. I did not hold them for much longer. My back was covered in sweat and I wanted to go wash off. \n \n After class, he came up to me. I glanced up at him as I packed my stuff. \n \n `` Yes, Boudreaux?'' I asked professionally. \n \n `` I just wanted to apologize for my behavior today, professor,'' the young boy said with sincerity that failed to reach his inexpressive eyes. \n \n `` Quite all right. I understand our schools are differently structured than in the States,'' I offered. Boudreaux smiled. He turned to walk away, but knocked a paperweight off my desk in his haste. We both bent to pick it up with our heads colliding. As we started away from each other his hand darted into my hair where his head had collided with mine. \n \n `` Are you okay, Professor?'' he asked, with what sounded like genuine concern, `` I did n't mean to cause you no harm.'' \n \n `` Fine, Boudreaux, be on your way.'' I picked up my bag and walked out the room, determined to get a shower and get several drinks. I wound up meeting several other professors at Faust's, a dive bar off the beaten path in Hogsmeade. After imbibing more than my fair share of a variety of brews, I stumbled home. I removed my hat, and shrugged out of my robes. I fell into bed, deciding the I would clean my teeth in the morning with a spell. \n \n Pain. I screamed. Searing pain through my stomach. My hands flew to my stomach looking for a wound, but found nothing. My heart raced as the pain did not relent, but built upon itself. Every movement made me explode in new types of agony. I screamed as the same sensation began in my shoulder. \n \n In the girls' dormitory of Ravenclaw, a young, blonde girl was bent over her desk with a needle in one hand, a small doll in the other. \n \n A voice came from behind her, `` Good job, Clara. Now stick the needle in its heart.'' The young girl did. A grin spread on Boudreaux's face as the girl turned and looked at him. \n \n She put down the doll, now with a needle sticking through the heart, and the pair joined hands. Boudreaux looked at a hair in his free hand. Short and dark. \n \n `` You never did like herbology, much did you, Clara?''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] We 've seen epic fantasy worlds based on historical Europe ( i.e . LotR ) and historical East Asia ( i.e . Avatar ) . Write about an epic fantasy world based on historical Africa .\n","story":"There was a land that they world liked best. It was in the center, closer to the origins of life. It was the oldest land, where it all began. In the north deserts spread harsh and vast, covering the earth in endless sand. South came the jungles and the wetlands that gave life and water to the world. Even further were plains with lakes and hills, and a great mountain. It was sacred and old, and some said if you looked inside you would see the dawning of all life before it burned your eyes in your skull. Next to the mountain was a deep crater so wide it would take a day \u2019 s walk to go from one edge to the other. In the crater and around it they built a city, invisible to the untrained eye, but if you knew the path the sight of it was breathtaking. Tan stone rose from the ground, becoming an extension of the world and not an enemy. This was where the palace lay, ruled by its king. \n \n He was tall and strong, with skin as black as wet soil that was smooth and flawless. He was beautiful in his terrible power, so one with the elements that he controlled that he flitted in and out of the world, never quite there, and always out of focus when you looked upon him. The sides of his head were hairless and shined in the sun, but on top in a long strip thick black cords were woven rightly to his scalp and fell down his back in an inky river. There were feathers and bones tied into the hair, trinkets to show off his experiences. He was neither cruel nor kind, but his love for his people ran deep, a primal need to protect and serve. His people thrived. \n \n The capital city was vast and sprawling, tall thick trees created a natural barricade outside the crater and defined the edges of the city they were twisted and large, as old as the mountain with all the knowledge of the world. There was more wildlife there, the ground was saturated with magic and life bloomed with its ministrations. Trees and vines grew in any available space, on the side of buildings and huts reaching up towards the heavens. They held the magic of the world, and they practically glowed in the dark bringing the people power and peace. The market stretched lazily around the circular city offering foods, clothing, riches and a riot of color and noise. Children would play between the alleyways while the adults meandered, never in a hurry but always busy. \n \n Woman could be seen bartering for vegetables in their colorful pieces of fabric wrapped around their waists and draped over their shoulders. Their hair when not tied tightly in fabric had intricate braids that held the dark locks in place. They were mighty and strong, warriors in their own right. The men wore wraps and had no hair upon their heads, many carried knives made from bone to display their prowess. The city was alive in the day, and in that life there was magic. Potion shops dotted the market, promising love and wealth and anything else a person could want for. Elementals with pink eyes held green fire in their palms and watched it dance to the rhythm of the world. Shaman blew powder into the air that turned into sparks and colors, making pictures of the future or the past. \n \n Beasts would prowl, left alone and respected by the people. They were great and terrible beats, some huge and feline, they had gnashing teeth and thick armored skin, their eyes glowed orange like demon fire, but they left well enough alone if they weren \u2019 t disturbed. Some said the king controlled them as he did all things, they were all connected, and a part of each other, and the king would never bring harm to his people. Other creatures roamed the land outside the crater, spreading out in the flat plains. Huge furry monsters with long powerful legs like elephants but twice the size rose from the ground, they were scaly with long snouts and longer flitting purple tongues that would taste the air for their small slits for eyes brought no real awareness. They breathed fire on occasion when the moon was just right, and their cries were heartbreaking in their loveliness. There were strange birds with feathers as sharp as knives that filled the air in great numbers. Their cries were painful and their spit burned. With unpleasant temperaments they were often part of the stories parents told children to frighten them into behaving. \n \n The kingdom was vast, and not without violence, yet it was well established on the continent and usually on good terms with the neighboring lands. They were a mecca for animals that provided tasty meat, and the magical gemstones that lay under the earth made them profitable to trade with. The jungles to the west provided them with wood and plants when it was needed, and deserts brought strange power that was found need under the sand. Everyone provided a function, and often rulers would become jealous and greedy, starting wars for land and prestige. The king was always reluctant to send his people to battle without reason, but when they fought they were a sight to behold. Long legs and strong arms would deal devastating blows to opponents as they bathed in the bloodlust, destroying their enemies. They had no had war in a long while. \n On this day an emissary from north region traveled through the streets, down into the crater and into the palace. He looked upon the King and trembled at the sheer force of wild power that pressed into his skin, taking the breath from his lungs. \n \n \u201c There is trouble in the far north. \u201d He begins simply. These people were never ones for fanfare or unneeded formalities. He had been advised that the King did not enjoy wasting his time. \u201c They grow more aggressive, sending scouting parties into our lands. Their water leviathans attack our boats and dry up the rivers. \u201d His tone was slightly desperate as he thought of the people of in his land slowly wasting away from dehydration. \u201c Our Queen sends her love and asks for your warriors. Too long has this enemy coveted our lands, long ago our ancestors agreed they would have the far north, free to explore the new lands, and yet they move south. They pray to wicked gods of wrath and destruction and they will not stop until the world is theirs, even if it burns as they take it. \u201d \n \n The king sits upon his throne, made of ice and stone. His eyes are black and bottomless, overly wide and eerie. He sits in silence, only tapping his finger against the arm of his chair rhythmically to a beat only he could hear. Suddenly his eyes fall closed and his head tilts to the sky. He breathes in a deep breath and holds it in his lungs. The air around him vibrates and everyone in the vicinity clutches their heads as their skin grows too tight. It was an eternity in a moment before he opened his eyes and smiled a crooked dark smile that promised death and darkness. His calm spoke volumes and the emissary knew that this man, if he was even a man had just communicated with the earth itself. \n \n \u201c I know this enemy. We have aided your Queen before and our love runs deep and strong. \u201d He stands to an impossible height and his blood red wrap crosses his shoulder and trails onto the ground. His steps make the stone quake and the vines crawling over the throne reach out desperately towards him, beckoning their king back. \n \n He lays a hand on the emissary \u2019 s shoulder and forces him to rise. He looks into his eyes, still smiling a terrible smile, and the man was afraid. \u201c I have thought long of this even before your arrival. \u201d The king says softly, yet it seems his voice comes from all corners of the room. \u201c I am not rash. \u201d A murmur of arrogance rumbles from the other elders. \n \n \u201c Tell your queen we will go to war. \u201d \n\n"}

Colours had become so natural in life that no one noticed it at first. It didn \u2019 t happen till someone posted on the internet about the sea not seeming so dark blue anymore and seemed more\u2026grey. It was then people started to realize. Leaves became black. Tree trunks became white. The soil became grey. \n \n Then the lighter colors started disappearing and people started losing it. Yellow became black. Pink became black. Orange became black. \n \n Then finally the sun became black and everything was just colourless. \n \n Humans didn \u2019 t do so well with losing colours in their lives. Suicides and murders and violence rose dramatically and depression rates shot through the roof. Someone described it like going blind, but worse, because everything was still there. \n \n It was all gone. There was no more colours. Not unless you considered black, white and grey colours. But no one did. The colourless age was upon the world. \n \n - \n \n Daniel was six when the colours went out. He remembered waking up one day and not having any more coloured television to watch. He remembered it was a gloomy day for everyone, and he remembered the President coming onto the black and white screen to announce that it was going to be okay. \n \n Was it okay? Daniel guessed it was. He had lived through it till now, till he was twenty-four now. He couldn \u2019 t even remember how colours looked like anymore. \n \n Daniel pulled on his gloves and set out into the raging cold. One thing about colours not being there was that there was pretty much no difference in winter, where everything was still white. It looked beautiful to him and that was all that mattered. \n \n As he ran down the street for a quick jog, he spotted ahead someone moving boxes. Someone was moving into the neighbourhood, which was new. No one had moved here in a really long time, as this neighbourhood was an old one and Daniel knew everyone down the block. \n \n He couldn \u2019 t see the person behind the blocks, but he could see that the person was moving rather unsteadily.

Daniel smiled a comforting smile, \u201c No worries. \u201d \n \n She wore a beanie over her head, her long hair flowing out under it. Her fringe covered her forehead and she wore owl glasses, which captured her big round eyes within its lenses.

They were called tattoos in The Before- initially considered taboo, then art, then the norm. People chose them, designed them, and blazed them into their skin with needles. A choice. This concept is foreign in The After. \n \n When Jesus returned to us from Heaven ( once known as Gliese 581g ), everything changed. The marking of one's skin angered the Lord- he forbade it in The Book and his colonization disregarded the warning. It was the last straw in a wave of separation from the life dictated in The Book. A group known as Atheists convinced the colony that the Lord, Jesus and the rest of our mother-planet did not exist. The entire population lived as they desired, disregarding the warnings of the Lord. This angered our mother-colony and they ordered the return of Jesus to both educate and punish us all. \n \n As one of many consequences of our unlawfulness, Heaven disposed of free-will. The concept of anything being a choice, even the word choice, is foreign to me and my comrades. Our lives are completely charted out before we take our first breath.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are an alien explorer sent to make first contact with Earth . You never made it .\n","story":"Zerda stared at his holographic monitor and looked from his console, his four eyes blinking at me. We sat in the confined space of our command pod, aboard our interstellar scout ship the Drix'ridia. \n \n The pod was filled with glowing translucent holographic lights from our various panels, monitors and holo-graphic displays. I could sense he was rather serious by the scowl on his pale gray skin. \n \n `` We approach the primary planet of the Sol system.'' he pushed a holo button and the protective heat shield slid open above our command cockpit, revealing the darkness of space. I held my breath as a large grey orb suddenly appeared above us. \n \n Zerda nodded. `` It is the only moon of the primary planet, we should be clearing it's darkside in two pectars.'' \n \n I shook my head as I leaned back from my console, my eyes stinging. I had been watching transmissions from Earth for the last 1800 Pectars and I was tired, nearly exhausted. \n \n It had seemed exciting at first when I was summoned by the Zoraxian high command to help with the scouting mission. Like most young officers for the Zoraxian space fleet I had been excited beyond all measure of the word. It was why we all joined, to explore the unknown and reach out across the stars to meet alien species. \n \n The drama and transmissions of the Sol system had been well known. They had been generating low mega-watt energy transmissions for over eighty years and the Zoraxian high command knew it was soon time to make initial contact. \n \n You can imagine my shock when I and Zerda were chosen from thousands of Zoraxian fleet candidates. I had never been more proud in all my career. Of course there was a price to pay. \n \n It meant a long term journey across the Kitos sector, traveling across 16 light years to interact with a potentially backward or dangerous alien society. I had been thrilled and carried out my duties to the best of my ability. I dreamed what initial contact would be, what secrets we would discover. It all made me feel like a child again. I had been filled with awe with the idea of reaching across the vastness of space and making some meaningful contact with these species. It would n't just be a highlight of my fleet career, it would be a crowning achievement of my life as a officer and as a Zoraxian citizen. I would make history and bridge a gap that was 16 light years across. It could possibly change everything... forever. \n \n This excitment had fueled me like some limitless power source. All through my training, all throughout our long distance journey. Even as we deployed from our long range cruiser from beyond the solar system. This excitement had carried me so far..... until we arrived to the Sol system and started to receive transmissions from the primary planet. I studied them with abated horror. Even after 1800 Pectars I had said little to Zerda. \n \n I double checked my translator settings again, something had to be wrong but for the tenth time I found no error in our computer translation system. The images and videos I was seeing were correct and I shuddered in my seat. I cataloged them and recorded them, but I already knew exactly what I was looking at. It was barbarism. \n \n `` Whats wrong?'' Zerda asked, noticing my cranial tentacles were writhing, a sign of Zoraxian discomfort. \n \n `` The earthlings.... are...'' I held my breath. \n \n `` What? What is it Perdos?'' Zerda asked me, two of his eyes staring at me, his other two eyes staring at the navigation system. `` Do they have defensive orbital star fighters? Do they intend to intercept? Tell them we are peaceful'' he said with a worried expression on his brow. \n \n `` No. They might... Earthlings are far more dangerous than we were told.'' I stammered. \n \n `` What do you mean?'' He asked, his 4 eyes now staring at me. \n \n `` Our initial reports are incorrect. They are not a peaceful civilization on the cusp of interstellar travel Zerda.'' I stated plainly. I let out a sigh and I saw his cranial tentacles emerge from his gladial sacs on the side of his head. \n \n `` Explain Perdos.'' he said in a commanding tone. \n \n `` I have studied these earth transmissions in detail and have come to the logical conclusion that we are in grave danger.'' \n \n There was a moment of silence as our Zitranium engine roared as we crossed the darkside of the moon. Above us, we watched as a large blue orb fill the darkness of space. The planet earth in all of it's majesty was staring down at us with it's blue oceans and white clouds. \n \n Zerda checked the sensors. `` Multiple transmissions across the EM spectrum. They could be scanning us. What should we do?'' \n \n `` We turn around immediately and abort the mission. Perhaps recommend planetary sanitation.'' I retorted. \n \n `` Why? According to initial radio telescope scans, they have mastered energy transmission.'' \n \n `` No, they have not. They are a crude civilization that is war mongering and dangerous. I have come to learn they are ill suited for space travel and highly xenophobic. They may kill us on sight and steal our technology. The transmissions can not be interpreted any other way. They are barbaric.'' \n \n `` Explain Perdos.'' Zerda replied. `` I did n't come across the Kitos sector to fail.'' \n \n `` I told you, we are in imminent danger. Earthlings are extremely dangerous. They do not care for themselves. They imprison and segregate each other. They commit acts of crime and war with one another. They are exceedingly advanced in warfare. They are barbaric with one another and utilize prisons, torture, hoard food and resources from one another. They do n't even share planetary resources. They are filled with small minded hate, and just not a few. The masses Zerda.'' \n \n `` Barbaric.'' Zerda said as he turned his attention to our weapon systems. `` I'm powering up our photon carrier gun and our energy shields. We will protect ourselves!'' \n \n A red alarm started to flash and we both saw a high energy burst transmission from Earth orbit. \n \n Zerda's tentacles sucked back into his head. `` High output transmission detected at grid 034 mark 78. I'm isolating the focal point.'' \n \n A display suddenly showed a fork shaped metal building orbiting planet earth and we gasped. It appeared to be a military station in high orbit. I looked to Zerda. \n \n `` They may be charging a energy weapon. Or it could be a transmission.'' I said watching the strange building floating high above the planet. \n \n Zerda turned his four eyes to me. `` It may be a attempt to communicate.'' \n \n I turned back to my console and began isolating the primitive radio frequencies. I flipped the audio on and we heard a crackle followed by a alien voice speaking in some primitive language. I activated the voice translator and suddenly we could hear them. \n \n `` This is the International Space Station. To the unknown vessel approaching from the dark side of the moon. We mean you no harm. Can you please identify yourself?'' the message began to repeat and I turned off the audio. \n \n Zerda looked at me concerned. `` Should we reply? We have a chance to make initial contact.'' \n \n `` No Zerda. We will not.'' I stated boldly. `` We ca n't.'' \n \n `` Why not? We are in transmission range, we can make contact with them!'' he said angrily. \n \n `` No, I have studied the earthling transmissions. The one thing they excel at is deception. They are no doubt preparing orbital defenses to destroy us. Or worse yet, capture us for surgical experimentation.'' \n \n `` Understand this Zerda, if they are violent with one another, they will treat us no better. In my study of the earth broadcasts I have learned much. They are war mongers. They let children starve and excel in butchery.'' \n \n Zerda seemed to nod his head. `` I understand. It seems a shame to have traveled so far to realize this now. Perhaps we should send a message to our earthling neighbors. That we are not to be trifled with.'' \n \n I nodded my head. `` Agreed. Let us send one transmission to this... International Space Station. Let them know that we too are acquainted with war and will not tolerate enemy threats from such a backwards and pathetic race. Target this so called International Space Station.'' \n \n `` Affirmative'' Zerda said activating the weapons systems with his tentacled fingers. `` Locked in to the main super structure.'' \n \n We heard the Zitranium battery power our forward energy carrier and I scoffed. `` They do not want to communicate to advance themselves or share science. They are not on the path to enlightenment. They are monsters, parasites. We will communicate them in the only language they understand.'' \n \n Zerda nodded and in a bright green flash we sent the only transmission they would comprehend. \n\n"}

He has a big presentation to his boss' boss, Alicante, on a recent advertising campaign that went bad. The campaign had been led by the Paris headquarters and been a disaster and Leo expects the presentation to be fairly straightforward... ] * \n \n `` BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY DOLPHINS?'' yelled Alicante. \n \n `` I... I...'' I stammered. I had no idea what he was talking about. `` The numbers are bad all around. We completely underper-'' \n \n `` Stop!'' Alicante was completely red in the face. `` You're telling me you do n't know how we did with the baby dolphins? How the HELL do you want to convince me that this campaign was a failure?'' \n \n `` The baby dolphins...?'' I ventured. \n \n `` Why do you think we're doing this campaign with Facebook and Google and whatever?'' he yelled, `` Our whales do n't care. They're old and rich. It's a wonder if they use e-mail! We're doing it to get the younger ones, early, BEFORE they become whales.'' \n \n I had heard the term *'whales'* before. It was typically used to describe our wealthiest consumers. But this was the first time anyone had mentioned *'baby dolphins'*. And should n't it be *'baby whales'*? I thought. I bit back the retort. \n \n `` We probably did terrible with the baby dolphins too,'' I answered, `` We did terrible everywhere-'' \n \n `` You do n't have that data! How many did we sell to the baby dolphins? If we reached a ton of them, then the campaign was a success and that's it. The. Baby! DOLPHINS!'' he said, punctuating each word by bashing his fist against the table, `` When it comes to digital marketing, that's all that matters.'' \n \n He slammed his laptop closed, stood up and walked to the exit. Turning around, he looked at my boss, purposely ignoring me, and added: `` Next time do n't waste my time, Thierry. I'm waiting for the numbers by e-mail. If they're low we'll tell the Paris HQ to change agencies.'' He stormed out. \n \n Thierry looked at me with a mix of pity and guilt. \n \n `` Do n't worry. We'll get him the numbers and he'll see you're right. `` \n \n `` Yeah,'' I answered half-heartedly, fully aware that I had wasted my big chance. I had looked like an unprepared idiot in front of the big regional boss, and there was no coming back from that. Even if I was right and even if the concept of baby dolphins made absolutely no sense. \n \n I went back to my desk and e-mailed the regional headquarters asking for the numbers. Since Alicante's terminology seemed completely arbitrary, I decided to define baby dolphins as consumers under 35 with an annual income over 80,000 euros a year. That seemed fair. \n \n I got the numbers back just half an hour later - as expected, they were low: Only 215 of the 1,312 SCIPs we had sold since launch had been to baby dolphins, or only about 15 %. Meanwhile, our total sales target had been 25,000. We had n't even come close. Worse, our branch itself had only sold 32, against a target of 2,100, of which only 2 were to baby dolphins. I had been right, but it was too little, too late. I forwarded the numbers to Thierry, and left the office early. \n \n For once, I did n't enjoy the drive home. I went straight to my room without a word, collapsed on my bed and fell asleep. \n \n -- - \n \n I turned off my alarm at 8:00 a.m., stared at the ceiling, and went back to sleep. *Fuck today. I'll head in late, nobody cares anyways, * I thought. \n \n My phone started to ring. I woke up again and looked at the time: 10:47 a.m. Thierry was calling me. He's probably concerned I quit, I thought, and picked it up. \n \n `` Hey Thierry, I'm sorry I-'' \n \n `` WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?'' Thierry yelled into the phone. \n \n `` I'm at home, I-'' \n \n `` WELL GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE QUICK. Alicante is arriving in 3 hours for the presentation and we have n't had time to go over it yet! I'm expecting you in 30 minutes tops!'' yelled Thierry and hung up before I had a chance to answer. \n \n I sprung into action, powering through my confusion. I took the quickest shower of my life, jumped into the car and drove off. On the road I kept trying to understand. Was Alicante coming back for a second meeting now that we had the numbers? Maybe the numbers were so disastrous that Alicante wanted to understand the digital side more? Had the regional HQ messed up the data they sent over? I glanced at the time on my dashboard. 11:12. *I'm almost there, * I thought. \n I did a double take. Next to the time on the dashboard was the date. \n \n **17 Apr. 2019** \n \n April 17th? What? Alicante was supposed to come in on April 17th, that much I was sure of. But April 17th was yesterday. \n \n The date in my car was probably just set up wrong and I had n't noticed it until now. It was the only explanation. I calmed myself down, parked my car and ran into the building, straight into Thierry's office. \n \n `` Open your computer,'' he said hurriedly. I pulled out my HP laptop, and it immediately opened to the Powerpoint presentation. \n \n `` Go to slide 14,'' said Thierry. I did. But my eyes focused on the top right corner of my screen. On the date. A date which read: 17 Apr. 2019. \n \n This was getting weirder. No wonder I had been confused about the date two days ago. It seemed like every single one of my electronics was wrong. \n \n `` There's a typo here on SCIP, you spelled it SICP,'' said Thierry, `` Change it. And go to Slide 17.'' \n \n *That was the exact typo he pointed out yesterday, * I thought. I looked at him quizzically, but he was focused on the presentation. \n \n My mind was running through the situation. Both devices said it was April 17th. Thierry was doing the exact same changes as yesterday. Changes that should have been fixed yesterday but had miraculously re-appeared overnight. \n \n I could find a dozen explanations for what was going on: I had never realized the dates were off by a day. Thierry was suddenly struck with amnesia. Someone had hacked into my computer and car at exactly the same time. \n \n But the simplest of all explanations was also the weirdest one: *I was living yesterday all over again. * \n \n I sat, dumbfounded by the realization, but still mechanically going through the motions of fixing the typos. Was this really what was going on? It made no sense, but then again, strangely, it was the only explanation that made at least some sense. When the clock hit 1:30 p.m., Thierry told me we were done and to go back to my desk before Alicante came in. \n \n I walked to my cubicle like a zombie and sat down, staring into space. *What the hell was going on? Was it really April 17th again? Was yesterday a dream? * \n \n I loaded the homepage of the newspapers Le Figaro, Le Monde and Nice Matin. All said the same thing: April 17th. So much for my devices being wrong. I checked my calendar, and Alicante's meeting was scheduled for today. Nothing on it for yesterday. Nothing on it for tomorrow. \n \n I stared at my screen. If it's not a dream, then I'm about to re-live a terrible chewing out by the big boss. I checked the time: ten minutes until Alicante arrived. I quickly opened the presentation and inserted a slide at the front with the numbers I remembered from yesterday, complete with an accompanying visual. I finished polishing it up just as Alicante walked in through the door. I got up and walked into the meeting room. \n \n As soon as salutations and the casual small-talk expected in French meetings were done, I plugged in my laptop to the projector. The title slide'Review of SCIP Marketing Campaign - Results and Suggestions' appeared. I started talking. \n \n `` *Bonjour* Mr. Alicante, and thank you for being here today,'' I said, my voice slightly shaky with yesterday's memory, `` We will be going over the results for the SCIP campaign, which, as you will see, was definitely not a success. Before we go into the details however, it's important to remember the one metric at the core of this marketing effort...'' \n \n As I pressed the next button on my keyboard, loading the new slide I had just inserted, I saw Thierry react with horror and surprise. Next to the chart I had just created was a giant picture of Flipper the Dolphin. \n \n ``... what about the baby dolphins?'' I continued, `` The most important metric of all to judge success when it comes to digital campaigns. And we completely, totally, failed when it comes to the baby dolphins. They account for only 215 SCIPs out of 1,312 sold, for a total target of 25k. Only 2 baby dolphins for this agency. Now let's look at the reasons why...'' \n \n I looked at Alicante. He was captivated, nodding and taking notes on the numbers. \n \n `` Please go on,'' he said, `` Mr...?'' \n \n `` Leo,'' I answered, beaming, `` Leo Melikian.'' \n \n **~ End of Chapter 1 ~** \n \n Wow - you made it all the way here!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` For our safety as well as their own , you must never let these creatures form their own society , no matter how much they plead . ''\n","story":"`` So, Steve,'' Margarey clapped her hands together, ruffling the table linen like fabric around the cuffs of her church gown sleeves. `` Since this is your first day with the kids there are just a few- suggestions, that we like to make. Obviously, we do n't talk about anything adult with them, we are n't here to give the talk or discuss the reefer, if it comes up tell them how sinful it is and immediately inform the parents. Half of the parents only drag their kids here to keep them in line anyways. Let's see,'' she lowered her still clapped hands and leaned in. \n \n Steve had been teaching for years, these kids were nothing new. It was a little extra change in his pocket and after Virginia left him, it was n't like he did n't have the time. She swore he was n't religious enough, this ought to showcase how wrong she was. `` I think I can handle a few kids, I teach for a living and nothing compares to the first day of school. This certainly wo n't.'' Margaery shrugged. \n \n `` Well, just no adult talking, no handing out too many sugary snacks and for our safety as well as their own, you must never let these... creatures form their own society, no matter how much they plead. That's how the last church burned to the ground after all.'' Margaery wagged a finger at Steve. He was n't afraid of her, not physically, but he made sure to take down a mental note of her rules; he'd never heard of a group of kids taking power to that extreme. \n \n Steve pushed his tie straight and walked off towards the Sunday school room, grabbing a bible from the church's library as he went. The room had a giant wooden relief of a whale whose mouth surrounded the couch. Luckily it was n't painted realistically, that was probably more terrifying to the children than the responsibility of forming a society. Steve shook off the thought and turned to the passage the sermon had been over. He had to reference the handout from the service since he'd been running late and barely caught the end of it. \n \n Bells tolled below him. The kids would be here any minute, Steve could hear the stampeding crowd hustle down the hallway. The first duo pushed through the door like conjoined twins escaping the womb for the first time. `` Hello,'' he greeted them. They returned the favor, plopping down on the first part of the couch. Seven more kids arrived, each varying in the stereotype they fell into: the gothic girl who just wanted to please her mother with this, the rich boy who wanted to justify his sins on the football field, the musician who wanted new material- they fit perfectly in Steve's ideas of clicks. They'd never join up for power, not that kids even had that thought. \n \n `` Well, is this everyone?'' Some of them nodded,'' great we'll begin with what we heard in the sermon today about sharing-'' a hand flew up from the first arrivals. \n \n `` Can we talk about something....it's kind of related.'' \n \n `` Possibly... give me more specifics,'' Steve said, shutting the Bible on his finger as if it were a bookmark. \n \n `` I read this article about starving nations in Africa which we give weapons too. Why would n't we also give them food? It's probably in our best interest, right?'' the boy tucked his hands into his hoodie pouch and leaned back against his brother. \n \n `` Well, there are many considerations and just plain people involved in that. I'm sure we send them some food...'' Steve opened the book again, but was quickly interrupted by another member of the youth. \n \n `` It's because sharing is n't as important when you already have the power. Why would you sacrifice some of your power just to help someone else? There's no positive outcome, none guaranteed,'' this young lady was wearing a field hockey jersey and had her hair back in a ponytail from a morning run he was n't quite cleaned up enough for. \n \n `` Can we do a demonstration Mr...'' \n \n `` Steve, just Mr.Steve is fine. What kind of demonstration?'' Steve asked, setting the bible down. If his classes engaged him like this during the school year he would n't hate his job every Tuesday- this was what teaching is about. Reaching the kids and seeing what they can teach you. \n \n `` Well, let's use the goldfish, and we'll split into three teams. Team one will be the wealthy nation, they can have the whole box of goldfish.'' \n \n `` The classic classes course- very nice. Okay, second world gets a full bowl and third world gets two goldfish per person- and they need at least five to survive the entire session,'' Steve summarized. He grabbed the goldfish and the bowl and began to fill it up. He pushed the bowl to the middle of the couch, shook out two for the kids in the bean chairs and passed along the box. \n \n `` Thank you Mr.Steve- oh, now everyone appoint an ambassador to petition the other colonies,'' the other brother spoke this time. Steve, now catching on to what was happening was n't sure how he'd stop this train Margaery had warned him about. \n \n `` No, no ambassadors. I was told, quite forcefully, not to let you all form a society and that's what you're doing. You may eat the goldfish but, we're going back to the passage for the week. Nice try,'' Steve picked up the bible right when the youngest boy in the group started to cough. \n \n ``'cough' water,'' he coughed again, doubling over. Steve leaped over his seat and made for the water fountain. There was a cup just to the left of the fountain and he filled two, rushing back to the young man. It was too late, they'd already begun trading goldfish and had latched the door shut. They'd started their society. The boy who'd asked the first question pulled out his lighter- Steve would never get Virginia back at this rate, he'd have to find yet another church to teach at.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] During the apocalypse , you find out that Zombies are completely sentient and self aware . They know what they do is wrong . But they just ca n't stop themselves .\n","story":"My name is Frank Vitali and I am head of staff at one of the countries biggest addiction clinics. We are located near Los Angeles and have close to 300 beds. We celebrated our 20 year anniversary in 2016. I will now tell you how my clinic turned from an addiction clinic into something completely different. \n \n When the zombie apocalypse started in the fall of 2017 people did not turn up to work anymore. How would they, they could not leave their houses. So our inpatients were left alone. Some of the patients ran off, but some made a fort out of the clinic. There's lots of food, you can survive for a while. When one of our patients, Mark Theramus, was outside the clinic looking for a water source, he was approached by a zombie who tried to bite him. Mr. Theramus is an amazing man who made a fortune selling gameboys to nostalgic people in the late 2000s, so, after learning how to cope with cravings, he shared his knowledge with the zombie, who in turn did not bite him. Mr. Theramus took the zombie to the clinic with him and offered him help with the cravings. \n \n Therapy does not need words. Therapy works in many ways and the addicted patients took in more zombies and taught them what they knew about addiction and cravings. It was amazing, the clinic turned into the safest space in the area within 4 weeks. Zombies and men living in harmony. The first moments with zombies were held behind a piece of near-bulletproof glass and the people assessed the zombies motivation and only let in the ones that they thought suitable. \n \n After 11 weeks, a zombie relapsed. He could not help himself. He had been sweating and shaking horribly from withdrawal symptons and the patients did not chain him to the bed, like they usually would. He bit an old man just to turn him into a zombie. Mr. Theramus saw and killed the zombie with his bare hands. Nobody had been prepared for a situation like this. The other zombies cravings got stronger after word spread around and other zombies were scared for their life, so it took exactly three hours to turn the clinic into a madhouse. Zombies bit people. Some zombies tried to resist their urges for brains, but what are you gon na do when all others get a piece of the pie and the people are gon na be killed anyway? It was madness. I would never recommend you let zombies into your clinic. Addiction kills.\n"}

Once they run out of energy , they die .\n","story":"`` Doctor, there's a meeting on the third... floor?'' \n \n I entered Dr. Goodswin office, but he was nowhere to be seen. His chair was empty but it was clear he had simply left for somewhere. Perhaps the bathroom, or maybe he was visiting patients. I sighed and looked down at my energy organizer. I had been budgeting my daily energy so that I did n't burn it all up in my foolish young adult years. I knew that I would n't have enough energy to go searching for the missing doctor. I decided to leave him a memo. I borrowed some paper off his desk and wrote `` Meeting: 3rd floor, 13:00'' \n \n Suddenly my pen sank through the paper, ripping a hole in it to reveal a hidden button in Dr. Goodswin's desk. A door opened behind the filing cabinet and beyond, I could see a new hallway leading off to God-knows-where. It had a similar look as the hospital halls, expect for the scuff marks on the floor and the damp air coming from it. I was curious. Dare I enter? What secret did the doctor hide? \n \n The hallway was narrow, but by no means cramped. I was surprised by the sudden drop in gradient as the hallway led downwards. I stuck to the wall and continued on my way. \n \n Just before claustrophobia started to set in, the hallway opened up to a series of wider hallways and solid steel doors. Someone surely went to great lengths to make the place clean, as it was even more sterile than the hospital itself. What for, though? What was down here that needed such strict cleanliness? I suppose there's only one way to find out. I quietly pushed open the first door on my left and entered. \n \n And it was as if it was out of some science-fiction horror. \n \n Rows and rows and rows of tubes filled with fluid with babies of all shapes and sizes inside. And as I walked deeper and deeper into the room, I could see that the fluid was slowly decaying the body. Skin was missing, revealing burst blood vessels and muscles. The white of bone could be seen underneath. \n \n I could n't bear to stay any longer, but curiosity stopped my legs from going back. I forced down my stomach and tried to shield my eyes from the skeletons as I struggled on to the end on the room. \n \n And at the end was a giant machine that looked like some sort of boiler. In front of it stood a beaker full of glowing liquid. It radiated warmth and energy and I felt the heat on my skin like a cozy radiator. \n \n ``... ved one of the greatest problems...'' \n \n Voices! They came from somewhere behind the machine. I had to hide! In panic, I crouched under one of the pipes and watched as Dr Goodswin and some scientist person walked towards the beaker. The doctor looked frazzled, like he had n't slept for days, and yet he kept a calm demeanor. His scientist friend was excitedly jabbering at him. \n \n `` Dr. Goodswin, if what you are saying is true, you could be known as one of the greatest scientists to ever live. But...'' \n \n Dr. Goodswin spoke. `` You want to see if it truly works, yes?'' \n \n The doctor took a syringe out of his pocket. He sucked up a the tiniest amount of the glowing liquid and held it up for the scientist to see. The scientist was almost wetting himself in excitement. Dr. Goodswin then carefully injected himself with the liquid. The change was immediate. His receding hairline grew back to a full head of black hair. Wrinkles on his face smoothed out and he shrunk about 6 inches. Mr. Goodswin at 60-some years of age had the image of a person in their mid-20s. My heart raced ad I tried to comprehend what just happened. \n \n Just then my organizer rang to tell me I had just run over my budget energy. \n \n Mr. Goodwin and the scientist instantly saw my hiding figure as I tried to silence my chirping alarm. Silence hung in the air. \n \n Then I made a break for the door. Past the shouting men, past the glowing beaker, past the dissolving bodies. The door seemed a mile away and the footsteps behind me grew closer and closer. \n \n Finally the doctor tackled me to the ground. I squirmed and struggled to break free, but it was no use. I clearly was n't going anywhere. The last thing I felt were two hands on my neck pressing down far too hard as my brain slowly lost oxygen. My vision faded and I died, surrounded by hundreds of bodies full of energy.\n"}

What an elaborate prank, if it is. Ask a guy to help you move and direct him to an impossible-to-find, completely empty house. \n \n You're a bastard, Tim. What the hell is going on here? \n \n I walk into the middle of the large room and look around me 360 degrees, like I expect to find Tim behind me, or in the kitchen making tea or whatever in the hell it is that Tim does. He seems like a tea drinker, though, does n't he? Someone who would go to all this stupid, pointless effort to have already moved out of a house before asking for help moving is probably off somewhere with a hearty cuppa. Milk and sugar too! God I hate that guy! \n \n I'm furious and confused. It's a combination of emotions that do not play nicely together. I feel used -- betrayed, somehow. And foolish. Like I should have known it was all a set-up, a game, a trap. \n \n But of course I did n't know. How could I? It makes no sense! \n \n I did n't know anything, anyway. I never knew anything about *Tim: The Nice Guy. * I never tried to know. I did n't want to because I did n't care. Might as well admit it. Tim, you nice-guy son of a bitch -- *I never cared about you! * \n \n I set the beers down on the counter in the kitchen and turn to leave. I do n't want them. They're warm, anyway, after driving around so long. Such a wasted day. I was just trying to be friendly, too. To pretend to be friendly. \n \n I notice the box then. On the mantle of the fireplace. It was small enough I had n't seen it in first glance, and anyway, I was too angry and confused. I'm not, now. I decided it did n't matter. It was kind of funny, actually. A really elaborate, pointless practical joke. I wondered briefly if I was on a hidden camera. I decided to wave and smile, just in case, and that's when I saw the box. \n \n I guess this is for me, I decided, as I went to pick it up. \n \n It was about the size of a ring box from a jeweler. Is Tim proposing? I laughed out loud, hoping the hidden camera, if there was one, liked my reaction. Ha ha, Tim, very funny stuff. I'm already married, though! Two kids! Shitty suburban house with a broken door knob and ankle-high grass! \n \n This hysteria was n't like me. I felt suddenly sick. A sour feeling was growing in my stomach. \n \n I opened the envelope under the box first. Mom had taught me to always read the card first before tearing into the gift, it's a sign of respect and appreciation. \n \n The handwritten note was signed simply, `` Tim.'' I read it several times to try to make sense if it, but I still was n't sure I had. It probably was n't real, anyway, but it *might* be -- I just did n't know. I did n't know anything about this guy Tim, after all. \n \n Nothing. \n \n __________________________________________ \n \n If you're reading this, I'm sure you're already confused, so I'll try to clear things up if I can. \n \n First, I'm sorry I deceived you. I hope you will forgive me for that. It seemed like the right way to do things. The direct approach would have been even more unbelievable. \n \n Secondly, I want to thank you. For your kindness to me. You were the only one who ever took the time to try to be friendly. I appreciate it. It meant a lot to me. I'm sorry we never got to be friends, but that's how it is sometimes, I guess. \n \n The final thing I want to say is this: I'm going away. I know you knew that, since I asked for your help today, but the truth is, I wanted to help you. I'm going away and not ever coming back. It's what I do, sometimes. It does n't matter why so I wo n't explain, although I'm sure you're probably curious. \n \n I wanted to give you something, to thank you for being nice to me. I wanted your kindness to pay off. I think kindness should be rewarded. So that will explain what's in the box, I hope. The paperwork will be arriving shortly. Everything's sorted out, you wo n't have to do anything. \n \n I was n't lying when I said I needed your help moving. Just not for me. \n \n Best wishes to you and your family, \n Tim \n _____________________________________ \n \n After reading the note several times, still not fully understanding, I opened the lid of the box slowly. Inside was what I expected to find, and what I was most surprised to find, somehow. \n \n A house key. The key ring stated this address, Lincoln Avenue. I held the key for a long time before gaining the ability to put it to the test. \n \n I went to the front door I had left standing open only minutes before, and turned the lock until it clicked. I did n't know what to expect from the key, but I was somehow both vindicated and shocked when it turned in the lock easily. *Click. * Unlocked. *Click. * Locked again. *Click. * *Click. * *Click. * \n \n The sour feeling in my stomach was gone, replaced with a burning in my throat and behind my eyes. \n \n The key. The house. \n \n Tim. \n \n I had n't lied. I had n't really cared about Tim, not *really, * but he had cared about me. He thought I was kind to him, and I wished I had been. Kinder. I hoped he never found out what I had been thinking. I was afraid he would, somehow, and would know what a fraud I'd been -- *just trying to be friendly* -- and that this would n't be real. If it even was real. I just did n't know. Not really. \n \n I never really knew anything about the guy.\n"}

I had just slashed my roommates in half. More children, `` SHUT UP!'' as my arms moved violently around and around. My world was being shattered and everything I love destroyed, `` WHAT IS HAPPENING!'' my mind breaks, I reach out for people to help, unaware of this power I had just awoken to.

It was dark, but with just that thought light came on and it was just as I had dreamed, this is still a dream. I decide to break the box, I was surrounded. Flood lights encircled me, I heard voices telling me to freeze. `` What the fuck is happening?'' I did n't like any of it, I was confused, so I sent everyone around me and everything away.

No, not to you, not to me. \n \n So, it was while traveling on Dingleberry Lane that young Artemis Groo met Mr. Mootle McBain. \n \n It was the grandest of luck the two met that afternoon, for you see Mootle was a peddler, and we're not talking balloons. \n \n He sold everything contraband, of any shape, any size.

They gave us showers, then shaved our heads, we all got tattoos with weird numbers on our forearms, mine was 11345-J. And asked us all about our religion and family and personal beliefs, it had a very holocausty feel to it. I asked them why the numbers and the guy in the lab coat, Dr. Bright or something, said \u201c For body identification \u201d all serious like. We all laughed but something in his eyes made me a little uncomfortable. There were twelve of us in the first group that came in. They called us a squad and said we were only allowed to talk to people of our own \u201c class \u201d or below and were barred from leaving certain areas. It all struck me as something very military. We were all \u201c D \u201d class personel. The same doctor that processed us all joked the D stood for soon to be dead. It was less funny this time. \n \n The mess hall was normal enough with all of us D class people sitting together eating whatever mystery meat they fed us. The higher ups sat off to the side. They always seemed busy and stressed constantly looking over their shoulders and talking to each other in whispers. The D class were much louder and seemed genuinely happier. You could tell which group you were in by how many people were smiling is what we joked about. \n \n My job was mainly leg work I worked in what they called a \u201c Containment Area \u201d For god knows what, they never told us, the rumors were from drugs to a prostitution ring no one really knew. Personally I thought it had a more government feel. I thought it was secret weapons or something. I wasn \u2019 t far off looking back. \n \n The day it happened was really different. See some higher up gave an order and we did what they said. Mostly I just sat guarding this door. But today was different there were lots of labcoats and military looking guys outside the door. I went up and talked to one of the guns. \u201c Uhh what \u2019 s going on? \u201d I asked confused. Maybe I \u2019 d get the day off. \u201c That \u2019 s on a need to know basis. \u201d He said from his tone I couldn \u2019 t tell if he was pissed or bored and it didn \u2019 t help that he was wearing these weird goggles. \u201c Alright I need to know I guard this shithole and as far as I can see you \u2019 re where I \u2019 m supposed to be guarding. \u201d I said probably a little too rudely for my rank but what the hell. \u201c It \u2019 s standard maintenance. \u201d He said in his half bored half I \u2019 m gon na kill you voice. \u201c You can stand here if you want it \u2019 ll be over soon and you \u2019 ll hopefully be reassigned. \u201d \u201c Alright then I guess I will \u201d I replied beligerintly this guy was getting on my nerves. \n \n I went to go sit down in my chair and tried to look intimidating. The problem was that I mostly just surfed the internet on my phone or napped when I was \u201c guarding \u201d so my body wasn \u2019 t really used to being on high alert. I didn \u2019 t want the military faggot to see me sleeping on the job though so I really made an effort but the constant hub of talking and mechanical clinking had me drifting off within the hour. It didn \u2019 t help that we usually stayed up late blowing our money at the local \u201c D-Class \u201d strip clubs and last night was no exception. Soon I was full on nodding off. \n \n I guess that \u2019 s what saved me. The nodding off I mean. I \u2019 m not proud of it but when that shitstorm went down I \u2019 m glad my eyes were closed. See I was having this dream where there was an explosion and then all these people screaming in this hole in the ground filled with fire and bodies. Then there were gunshots and in my half asleep state I was like \u201c God damn who \u2019 s shooting at me again I \u2019 m SLEEPING? \u201d then I woke up for real with a start and it was terrible fucking terrible. \n \n The first thing I noticed was the arm on my lap. What the hell. It looked like a regular arm which is the scariest bit the hand was opening and closing quickly and blood was rushing out all over my pants. Then the screaming and yelling hit me. I turned and looked and saw this\u2026 mass it \u2019 s belly all swollen and it \u2019 s arms all spindly and long, it was kind of human I guess, but like it hadn \u2019 t eaten in days. Anyways it was leaping from man to man just I don \u2019 t know how to put it. Devouring? Decimating? It was disgusting. I didn \u2019 t know what was going on. Pieces of those labcoat guys were just everywhere the metal from the container must have been 4 ft thick was punched open like a rocket launcher hit it. I didn \u2019 t know what to do. This was way over my pay grade. \n \n I pulled out my regulation NG-01 and pulled the trigger at the thing out of instinct. It hit it but honestly nothing happened really. It \u2019 s skin didn \u2019 t look too thick but it didn \u2019 t go in. All the military guys who were left alive were yelling something about \u201c Keters \u201d and \u201c Special goggles not working \u201d or some shit. I noticed a few were shielding their eyes from the thing like it was the sun or something which was weird cause it wasn \u2019 t. Anyways it finished the guy it was destroying and jumped like no human I \u2019 ve seen jump towards the next guy who was looking at it. And oh god the screams. That \u2019 s when I lost it. I just kind of puked and fell into the guts of this guy next to me and cried and must \u2019 ve passed out. That \u2019 s all I really remember. When I came to everyone was in pieces. I don \u2019 t know what the fuck this place is but I don \u2019 t think I will ever be able to work here again. I mean there were intestines everywhere and the smell and I saw the guy with the glasses or what was left of him he had this look of horror on his face like he saw the most revolting thing in the world right before he died.

They may be the most amusing ones. Watching a video of a starry night in 4k he somehow gets the idea of googling the physics behind consciousness. After reading a fascinating article about the supposedly quantum correlated nature of axon-stimulations its time to make a sammich. \n \n I hop on to the next person. I used to browse internet a lit myself. But well you know, just like gaming gets tiresome after a while, so you find youself watching Twitch. Its mostly the same. Sometimes a friend joins me ob this. I call him Brobot, but he is somewhat of a troll, he likes messing with people's minds while reading them. Thats cheating. \n \n The next one is a guy commenting his own WP on reddit. Thats pretty low, dude.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] After death , you find yourself in a generic office cubicle with Todd , the case worker appointed to debrief you on your life and prepare you for your reincarnation .\n","story":"He introduced himself as Todd but did not offer a hand shake. I seemed unable to talk. Todd was wearing an ill fitting, 1970's, pea green leisure suit. His white shirt had the biggest collar I had ever seen, they looked like wings. He was short, fat, balding, and struggled to stand up from his desk. He used his sausage like finger to point at a chair and I sat. Todd's cube was comprised of two metal office chairs, a grey metal desk and a rather thick manila file folder stuffed with papers. The file was the only item on his desk. There were no photos, awards, diplomas, or bookshelves, absolutely nothing that could tell me anything more about Todd. Todd's thick hands snatched the folder off the desk and he started leafing through the documents as if each only had a few words. Todd was resting the bottom of the file on his ample stomach. I pushed myself up from the chair a little to try and get a look. Todd's eyes locked on mine, as if I had insulted his mother. This lasted for at least five seconds. He flapped his fat hand indicating I should sit back down and I did. \n \n After just a minute or two he finally spoke. Todd's voice boomed and echoed like we were in an empty warehouse, `` So I hope your transfer here was relatively painless.'' I nodded. He continued, `` Good, well I'm Todd and it's my job to find you your next assignment.'' I had a million questions but I could n't talk. Todd had onion breath that easily made the trip across his desk, his teeth were yellowed and his puffy, red, right eye may have been hit in the past 48 hours. I could faintly hear other conversations, but I could n't recall seeing anyone else on my way to Todd's desk. I was begging my mouth to form words, questions, but it refused. \n \n The story of my life could fill volumes. Over 19,000 days filled with all sorts of people, conversations, feelings and adventures. Sure there was a lot of soul grinding monotony, but my life was an epic story and I was the main character. Todd was able to sum it up in just a few sentences. Todd said, `` So it looks like you were a decent kid, and a respectable adult with a little booze problem. You made a few women happy and a wife somewhat miserable. You were a good friend to a few guys and took decent care of your folks as they aged. All and all not a bad trip, well done.'' There was so much I wanted to say, I thought words were going to burst from my chest and cover his walls with random letters. My life was so much more than that. I was screaming inside, NO, WAIT! Todd was nearly to the end of the file when he stopped, grimaced, growled and locked eyes with me again. He ripped a page from the file, slammed it on the desk and stabbed it hard, several times with his stubby finger. `` What is this?'' He bellowed. It was me, in my Chevy driving on the freeway. I wanted to say it but I could n't. He replied as if he read my thoughts, `` Yeah, it's you. Driving in the left lane. Do you know what the left lane is for?'' He asked. He was clearly agitated. I glanced at the photo again looking for a clue, but all I could think of was driving fast. Todd screamed, `` No. Asshole. The left lanes are for passing. Passing slower cars. Assholes like you think you can just cruise in the left lane as long as you're going fast''. He made air quotes and continued, `` Fast is subjective, passing is not. If everyone would just get the hell over after they pass, traffic would be so much better. What a jerk. You're going back as a snail. Have fun being slow you inconsiderate prick.'' Todd waved his fat hand and I was floating inside an egg. Probably a snail. I still had so many questions.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] One day after thinking `` Can Anyone Hear Me '' You hear an answer .\n","story":"\u201c Yes, I can hear you, \u201d came a soft voice much like my own. I looked around but found no one there. I brushed it off as hearing things. But as I took a few more steps I heard it again. \n & nbsp; \n \n \n \u201c I said I can hear you. \u201d Came the voice, louder this time, but still retaining it's gentle nature. I looked around once more. There was no one near me. The house was empty. I spoke into my own head, feeling slightly silly as I did. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Hi? \u201d I thought. I wondered what could be causing this? Had I finally gone off the deep end or was I about to find out I had an new allergy I never even knew about. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Hi, \u201d replied the voice a few moments later. I could n't deny it, it was coming from my head. I shook a little at the thought. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Who are you? \u201d I asked, before instantly feeling silly. Why I am asking myself who I am? \n & nbsp; \n \n \n \u201c I do n't know, \u201d the voice responded. I paused for a few moments, unsure of my next move. How do you react when you are talking to yourself but do n't seem to know the answers to the questions you are posing? \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Well this has never happened before, \u201d I thought to myself, only to be interrupted by the voice once more. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Well I have n't been around before. I just started. \u201d It replied. I was confused, to talk to yourself is one thing, but to interrupt yourself during the conversation is a whole new level of madness. After a few moments of silence, the voice spoke up again. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c I'm a part! \u201d It exclaimed. It's voice showing a solid emotion for the first time since it started talking. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c A part? \u201d I asked, slightly confused by what it meant and slightly distracted by trying to remember the number of my doctor. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Remember? We learned about it in psychology class, \u201d continued the voice, talking over my attempts to find the number. I thought about it for a moment and suddenly it flooded back into my head, like it was almost fresh. The boring classes on Richard Schwartz and his idea that people were made up of little bits. My train of thought was cut off by the voice speaking once more. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c But if I am a part, what part am I? \u201d It mused, leaving me unsure if it was asking a rhetorical question or not. \u201c Could I be an exile? Running away from something we did n't like? \u201d It rambled. I found myself trying not to think so as not to interrupt. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c No, I do n't feel like an exile, anyhow exiles do n't just walk back in. That never happens in any story, apart from that game we played that time. But that is because Alice forgot she was playing an exile. \u201d It finished. It was weird hearing this new voice talking about memories from years ago. But as it did, I felt the memory come to the forefront of my mind, like I was remembering it myself. I smiled at the memory, I had forgotten those silly games we used to play. I had forgotten Alice, work had gotten on top of me since I moved and I never found the time to call her. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Well, I doubt I can be a firefighter. I never really had the looks for it, \u201d the voice started again. \u201c I mean being a firefighter suggests I am good in a crisis. But, I would think a part that was good in a crisis would n't pop up and scare you half to death. \u201d \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c You did n't. Do n't worry. \u201d I thought, trying to reassure whatever this voice was. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c I can hear your thoughts you know. I heard you mentally rehearsing the call to the doctor. \u201d The voice replied. I shuffled awkwardly, realizing my thoughts about it had not been dramatically positive. \u201c It's okay, I would do the same if I was in your position. Because I am you, so I ca n't pretend like I would think differently. \u201d It said, a slight touch of humour coming into it's voice. I smiled and nodded. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Well I ca n't think what part you are, \u201d I thought. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Maybe we do n't need to know yet? Maybe I just popped out at random? \u201d The part replied. I nodded to myself and the self inside myself. It had a point, I mean psychology was never exact. I smiled, I remembered my professor saying that. I smiled some more as I remembered another friend dropping psych the second they could, they could n't handle the non-exact sciences. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Yeah. That could be it. \u201d \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Well then. I guess I should follow the model right? \u201d It said. And I quickly remembered the model. I had n't thought about it for years, but it felt like yesterday. I could almost smell the classroom, the memory was that fresh. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c Become part of the whole again, \u201d I recited, \u201c Until reality and your role clash once more. \u201d I sat down and smiled as I remembered a few more of my school buddies. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c That is exactly it. \u201d replied the voice. \u201c So I guess I'll be seeing you? Or hearing you at least. \u201d It said. I laughed a little and nodded. \n & nbsp; \n \n \u201c See you around, \u201d I thought. I sat there in silence for a little bit. My head quiet once more. I got up from the chair and smiled, still basking in the glow of the memories that had resurfaced. I moved to my computer, I had a few people I needed to catch up with.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Just for fun , you send away a small amount of money to an ad in the back of an old 1950 's science magazine claiming to send you a kit that could turn any car into a working airtight spaceship . To your surprise , you actually receive the kit - and after installing it , it works !\n","story":"MARCH 8th 2016 \n `` What the hell?'' I mutter under my breath as I noticed the radio screen starts displaying altitude rather than the station. The kit added a copilot steering wheel, like the ones in airplanes, an array of panels and buttons, whatever a *Reversed Oil and Fuel Converter* is, and many random looking parts into the engine. \n \n I need a copilot, so being 16, I send a text to my boyfriend telling him my parents are n't home and I needed some `` help'' with my car. So I continue inside to grab some snacks for the short trip to space we were going to have. Not 30 seconds later I hear the door burst open and see him standing there, he rips his pants off so fast it would n't even show up on a slo-mo video of the event. \n \n `` Slow down!'' I giggle as he starts to unbutton his shirt. \n \n `` What do you mean? This is what we always do when you need help with your car,'' he says with a puzzled look on his face. \n \n `` John, I actually need help with my car this time.'' \n \n His face turns into a disappointed confused one as he sighs `` Oh.'' \n \n He follows me out to the car and sees the very obvious upgrades to the exterior of the car and suggests my car is a time machine. I assure him it is n't but that it is a spacecraft that needs a copilot. `` So you're into roleplay?'' `` No, John this actually is a space ship, look at this box I found in the attic.'' I hand him the box to the kit and he laughs. `` Wan na'try' it?'' he asks in a sexy tone while raising his eyebrows. I get in the driver's seat and he gets in the passenger's seat. Still not cluing into the fact that we are n't having sex, he leans over to kiss me and bumps the airlock button, causing the rolled up windows to shatter and be filled in with very thick glass as a replacement in little time. \n \n `` What is going on!'' he yells. \n \n `` I told you this is a spaceship now!'' \n \n `` Huh?'' \n \n `` I press the big red button, we go into the sky, get it?'' \n \n `` This wo n't work Amanda, and your car looks like a beater with all these'Spaceship' parts attached to it.'' \n \n I continue to back it out of the garage and press a little green button reading, `` Pre-Launch''. The car stops, and tips upwards being supported by a *devolving compression strut* that basically looked like a hydraulic lift. \n \n `` Can you stop this, this is freaking me out, this is n't safe!'' \n \n `` Suck it up, you are the copilot.'' \n \n He yells, `` STOP!'' I hit launch, and I hear a clicking noise and the radio screen reads, *LAUNCH OVERRIDE*. The angle of the car changes slightly as the hydraulic tilt the car to a 75-degree angle. The rockets fire. \n \n I look at John and I see him passed out as a green gas is coming out of the glovebox. Not knowing what to do, I shake him. Nothing. I scream his name and all of the sudden I get dizzy. The gas has reached me, I begin to fade away. \n \n As the darkness fades away all I can see is whiteness, but my cramped and contorted body tell me I am in a small ball-shaped pod of some sorts and naked. I feel a sharp pain on my left forearm as text slowly appears letter by letter on my arm. \n \n INMATE RELEASE TIME: March 8, 2137, Earth Time Standard \n \n I scream as the pain intensifies.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The world is covered in sprawling skyscrapers with the richest living at the top and the poorest towards the bottom . One day the poor attack and take refuge higher up , claiming to be fleeing an unknown threat located on the ground and slowly moving up\n","story":"The towers were self-contained enclaves, shining monuments of man's brutalist urban designs, and vertical reminders\/enforcers of man's self-destructive need to socially stratify. \n \n James had grown up on the 22nd floor. It was a good middle class floor. A floor where teachers, police officers, fire fighters and middle managers were able to raise their kids in comfort and safety, 10 floors above the silter rabble ( as Jame's father called the denizens of the lower floors ) but almost 30 floors below the ostentatious `` creamers'' who lived isolated in the highest reaches of the tower. \n \n James, secure in the safety of his middle class banality, was employed as a system's analyst for the combined businesses housed in floors 20-33. He lived in a spacious apartment on 40, far above where his parents had raised him. He was headed down to 20 that morning to fix the systems at a bail-bond office. He hated going down to 20. It was a mixed use floor, part commerce, part business, and the highest floor that the `` silters'' from the lower floors were allowed reach. The floor had the feeling of a market on the edge of a slum, with peddlers selling legal and illegal wares with little concern. \n \n The tower news-feed was showing on the elevator's view panel walls as the elevator descended, the perfect faces of the digitally enhanced news anchors emitting Cheshire smiles while reading the dull daily news. The elevator stopped, the doors opened and James stepped out just as the anchors were warning residents about spreading silter unrest in the lowest floors. James, far above the rabble, paid no attention. \n \n The smell hit him at once, the intense mixture of openly cooked street food, human sweat, and various perfumes and colognes. The air seemed thicker than usual, and a terse tension hung in the recycled breeze. James fought his way though the midday shopping crowd to reach the bond office, but before he could reach his destination a shrill blast of noise boiled from the PA system. \n \n `` ALERT! Civil Unrest in the lower levels has intensified. All residents below 18 please report to your apartments immediately, a mandatory 23 hour curfew is now in place. All residents of floors 20 and above, please report to your local peace office as soon as possible. Schools, businesses and government offices on floors 1-45 are now closed.'' \n \n The crowd on 20 roiled and churned in response to the announcement. James fought his way through the crowd to the up elevator, finding himself in a large group of agitated and confused middle-floorers. There were well equipped guards by the up elevators, checking credentials to make sure no silters were going above their level. \n \n James made his way though the crowd, and faced no static from the guards when he handed them his ID and work-order. Stepping into the elevator, James found a place to stand and waited, watching the guards interrogating a shabbily dressed family who seemed very out of place. The patriarch, becoming frantically animated, was shouting and raving. James heard some of what the man was saying, but it made little sense. From what James put together, there was something big and violent happening in the lower floors and people were trying to flee up. \n \n James was n't too worried, he'd lived through at least 3 different attempted coups from the silters, and about 10 years ago a very organized gang had taken over all of the lower levels, until the full might of tower security was brought down on them anyway. \n \n Now filled with passengers, the elevator doors began to close. As they did, James heard a shout and saw the family arguing with the guards sprinting for the door. 3 kids made it in before the guards opened fire, bullets flying into and nearly ripping apart the rest of the family, some of the crowd, and a couple of unlucky elevator passengers. The doors closed with a clang, and the elevator began to rise, with the cries of the injured filling the small square space. \n \n James felt relief, the silter rabble wo n't make it to 40, there's no way they could get that far he thought. His optimistic daydream was stopped mid thought, as the elevator shuttered to a stop somewhere between 28 and 29. The lights suddenly flashed out, igniting fresh screams from the occupants of the elevator. Seconds later the red emergency lights turned on, and shortly after the vid screens flashed to life. \n \n.... To be continued?\n"}

Yes, I know this sounds absurd close your mouth you'll swallow an archon, He fears that his influence on the world has caused it to be less capable of standing on its own two feet and progressing beyond their primal natures, even with the benefits he has caused. Look at the humans: still on one planet, but technologically they could have had at least a moon colony by now. Yaweh... believes that his people, those that followed him and his teachings in his many forms have hindered the world. So, he has elected to be absent.'' \n \n `` Do you agree with him?'' \n \n Eyes were met, and a hard look came about Michael. \n \n `` Honestly, no. There is merit in that coddling a species prevents it from advancing, as my domain is Death, I understand that kind of decay well. But Yaweh.. Refuses to admit that he is being a negligent gardener, who abandons his yard in favour of an idealised fantasy of what a truly wild and free place is like.

So you do n't like the situation either?'' \n \n `` Well, I did n't say that. As I said, Death domain. Angel of Death. Riding out and causing entities to die for God's old Plan is more natural to me than this organised war business and all the paperwork needed nowadays.'' \n \n `` Huh.'' \n \n Oriel took the sword out from the desk. \n \n `` Welcome to the Outer Heaven patrols, Cherubim Oriel.

So let's hit those phones and see which lucky fan is getting a free trip to LA!'' \n \n Morning traffic is awful, if you work in the morning. I work the third shift, so I leave for work at about 11:20 at night when the road is empty and the air is still. At this point, I'm mildly skeptical that this is happening. It seems out of character for the world, that DJ giving away a major prize package when almost no one will be listening. \n \n I guess that is n't that crazy, giving away tickets on the third shift. I know the rock station late night DJ has his own prize book he gives tickets away out of, but it was the exuberance that really got my hackles up. Nobody working third shift is that happy. At least nobody I've ever met. \n \n I do n't know. Maybe he's new? \n \n `` Am I... am I the 93rd caller, Johnny Boy?'' I knew it was him before he spoke because I could smell him. He's bleeding all over my seat. Shitting on it too. That's the kind of thing you expect someone to say `` No one talks about that'' after, but that's not true. We're in the era of modern medicine, most people know you shit yourself when you die. There was even a Southpark episode about it. \n \n `` You sure are buddy! I'm going to put you on hold and we'll get your details, but first let me hear it, who's the radio station that made it all happen?!'' \n \n `` Wild 93 point fuckin' 3 Johnny Boy.'' His voice was raspy from the grave, it's been a while since he spoke, but still wet and gurgly - that's the blood. I do n't even know why I hear him talk, he damn sure did n't have much to say last time he was alive. He just grabbed at the sleeves of my shirt and stared through my eyes. He was losing alot of blood, probably was n't even seeing me. \n \n `` Hey, hey buddy, come on you ca n't say that on the radio, it violates the terms and conditions of the contest. I ca n't give you these tickets man.'' \n \n `` Oh, that's okay Johnny Boy, somethin' tells me I'll be busy that night...'' He burst into a cacophony of hot sticky laughter and chunks of tissue splattered against the passenger side of my windshield. Goddamnit, I'm going to have to get the whole damn car detailed by the time he's done. \n \n At least I'm not off my game. Nobody gives away tickets at night. I do n't have time for this shit, man. There's supposed to be an inspection tomorrow, big bosses coming through to make sure everything is on the up and up. I need to have my head in the game. \n \n I shut the radio off. I ca n't make John Tippit go back to the grave he's supposed to be laying in, but I can stop him from fucking with the third shift DJ. Guy's got a job, he does n't need that shit. \n \n He put his hand on my thigh and gave it a squeeze. \n \n `` How's you doing there, Johnny Boy? Long time... no see. No see, you get it Johnny?'' I let go of the wheel to take his hand off my leg and lost control of my car. We careened off the road and flipped twice, maybe three times down the hill. My name is n't even Johnny. I do n't know why he calls me that, I think it's just the way he talked. Maybe it is n't. I do n't know. I never talked to him. I fucking hated him. I thought he was stupid, I did n't think he was cut out to be there and I just did n't like him. \n \n I got out of the car and surveyed the damage. It looked alright. Definitely fucked up, but it might still drive if it were n't stuck at the bottom of a snowy hill. I pulled out my phone and fired off quick text to John, \n \n * Gon na be late, not too long* \n \n and put my phone back in my pocket to begin the trudge to work. I was only a few miles out. I just hope he does n't fucking follow me. I felt a little staccato of buzzing at my hip. Morse code for John. Did you know you can do that? You make your own custom vibrations for peoples ring tones, right there from the phone, no software or anything. I thought it was cool. Everybody is like that in my phone. Except people with really long names, those assholes just fuck everything up. \n \n *Whats up* \n \n *Slipped off the road, nbd* \n \n *Where ill get u* \n \n *Just a few miles away, nbd, I'll be there in a bit* \n \n *No come on man u cant take the points* \n \n *Just passed Riverside* \n \n `` We going for a ride Johnny? You know how I love to go for a ride. Maybe if you and me had gone for more rides, I'd still be alive. You ever think about that Johnny? They always said walking was safer than driving, but I died walking Johnny. I died fucking walking, you stupid prick mother fucker!'' He began to rail, striking me with a flurry of blows, and then we came tumbling down. \n \n Rolling in the snow, trying to gain leverage, but he's covered in blood still and hard to hold on to. He hits me again and again. I get a few shots of my own in, but they just strike the wet mass of tissue where his chest should have been. It was a mess down there. He did n't seem to notice. Makes sense though, he probably does n't go to many parties these days. \n \n Finally, my fist found bone. Most of his face was still pretty well together, and a good shot to the jaw got him up off of me. He shied sway from me after that, like a beaten dog. Maybe that's not right. He shied way like a fucking dingo or a jackle, waiting for me to fall over dead so he could eat my soft tissues before the predators who could kill their own food showed up. \n \n John pulled up and flashed his lights. I started walking over to the truck when he got out and came rushing over to me.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Whilst having a demon for a girlfriend is n't always the best , the benefits are well worth it\n","story":"`` Open the gate.'' \n \n & nbsp; \n \n Frederick stood alone in the small circle of yellow light cast by the covered lanterns hanging from oak posts either side of the castle gate. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Muh?'' the guard murmured as he awoke suddenly from half sleeping with his back against the huge, iron barred door, his brimmed helmet tilted forward over his eyes. He went through several states of formality in one second, from a sleeping baby to standing-to-attention-in-front-of-the-king, to a state of battle ready rage, and finally to a surly and unpleasant aloofness when he realised who woke him. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Here, you're that bard from The Blue Boar aint you? What do you want?'' \n \n & nbsp; \n \n `` I want you to open the gate for me'', Frederick replied, keeping his voice in the gregarious tone he used for his performances. He was far from being this man's friend but he had met him several times over the month he had spent in North Orchard, playing nightly at the inn where he stayed in lieu of paying for his board and meals. The guard's name was William. He had a narrow, bony face like a flint axe and a receding brown and grey hairline, he was some six feet tall, and wiry like a greyhound. Frederick had chosen him because he was the least religious of the guards, never coming to a single mass all month, so that would make things easier. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Why, what is your business? It is n't morning yet and no runners were sent you. What the devil is your business?'' \n \n & nbsp; \n \n Frederick could n't help but crack a smile at that, as regretful as he was, that was delightfully appropriate. He took a deep breath in, thought to himself, *go on then darling*, and exhaled slowly. It did n't feel as bad as he thought. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n William jerked suddenly as if a rock had fallen onto his helmet from the parapets high above. Every muscle in his body became as stiff as rigor mortis, and his breathing came in short, agonising gasps. Blood vessels bulged in his neck and forehead and his fists and eyes clenched shut. Finally with a great sigh of relief he relaxed and his eyes opened, vacant. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **I am here** \n \n & nbsp; \n \n He spoke. His voice was smooth like ashes and was as warm as woodsmoke, and it resounded in Frederick's head like a funeral bell. `` My love!'' he exclaimed joyfully, and ran to him, wrapping his arms around William's armoured body, looking up into his darkening eyes. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **He does not feel as good as you, sweet** \n \n & nbsp; \n \n Frederick blushed, and William slowly bent down and tenderly kissed him on the mouth. `` Bathsheba, my love'' Frederick whispered, and lay his head against the demon-host's chest. Frederick had become possessed three years ago. He was had been a wandering musician, living a simple life. He earned just enough by his wits to eat and survive until then next coin was given him. One night in thirty he would have enough to drink and laugh with some strangers, a rare a welcome taste of being without cares. But he had no close friends. He wandered to survive, for no inn would ever give him the security and happiness he craved. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n He had been singing and playing his mandolin in some small pub in Westmire when they came, the two most beautiful women he ever saw. One had eyes like emeralds and hair like flames, and the other had the sea of summer in her eyes, and her hair was a moon-shone night. They said their names were Bathsheba and Jezebel, and they had come to hear him play because they had heard tell from some travellers that a wonderful, handsome, and talented bard had come. They danced with him and laughed and talked and drank all night until Frederick confided in Bathsheba that he wanted to become rich and famous and never have to worry about anything again. Bathsheba pulled him close, so he could smell her shining hair, and whispered in his ear, `` I will make it so''. They lay together that night, and when Frederick awoke the next morning, neither of the beautiful strangers were to be found, and the landlord could not recall ever seeing such people. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n At first Frederick was upset at having lost this wonderful woman, and then he grew angry, and then he grew obsessed, raving night after night about the woman who stole his heart. He stopped playing, instead going from town to town searching every inn and every market, asking priests and fishwives, bakers and beggars if they had seen or heard of the beautiful Bathsheba. One cold winter night he ran out of silver to pay for a bed, and slept instead in a stable. And that is when he heard her. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **I am here, Frederick, and I love you. Now do as I say and you will have me and all that you desire** \n \n And so here he was, at the north-west gate of the King's castle. \n \n The demon-host William turned and strode to the wooden door. It raised Its mailed fist and slammed it three times against the planks, hard enough to raise splinters. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **Follow me and do as I say** \n \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Yes my love'', Frederick whispered again, his heart thumping in his chest. The port in the door snapped open, showing the face of Lewis, another patron of The Blue Boar. He looked out in puzzlement, with the same urgency and confusion William had experienced shortly before. In an instant Lewis threw the bar of the door and heaved it aside with strength Frederick had not expected from such an old man. He stood to the side holding the door open and raising a salute to the pair as the demon-host strode purposefully past with Frederick wandering like an acolyte behind. When he was past Frederick heard a noise like a pig biting a turnip. He turned his head and saw Lewis fall limply to the ground. Beneath his helmet was a stew of red meat and white bone. Lewis was a Godly man. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n The pair swept through the castle like the wind through the ribs of a rotten ship. The portcullis was raised, doors were opened, salutes were given and stains were left wherever guards were met who had been to church in the past month. They came to the door of the King and Queen's chamber. Outside of the door the Household Guard stood. All four, two either side of the arched door, all of a height at six and a half feet, all wearing polished steel breastplates etched with ornamentation and inlaid with the royal coat of arms in gold leaf, mother of pearl, onyx, jasper, and malachite, and in each of their hands they held a long fan flared partisan with a red tassel hanging from the head. When they heard the footsteps they stood smartly at the ready. From the shadows before them in the dark hallway a single silhouette emerged, and stopped. A second, shorter figure peered out from behind It. `` Who is this? What is your business? ``, one asked sternly. When no answer came he asked again, `` in the name of the Ki-'', his breath was cut short, and he fell with a clatter to the carpeted floor. The guardsman to his side placed a foot on his back and snatched his partisan from where it was buried in the nape of the other's neck. A third guardsman opened the door to the pitch darkness of the royal chamber. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **Wait here** \n \n & nbsp; \n \n Frederick waited, and waited, and waited in the spice smelling, carpet hushed darkness outside the King's chamber, with three iron giants breathing uneasily around him. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **Come in** \n \n & nbsp; \n \n One of them spoke. And gingerly he stepped forward into the obliterating blackness of the room, and the door closed behind him. A flame appeared in the darkness, suddenly illuminating a figure near the hearth. The hearth crackled to life and before him stood the beautiful Bathsheba, bathed in the radiant red light of the fire, and by her stood the King and Queen, both grey, both flabby, both vacant eyed, and stiff. Frederick's face twitched into an uncertain smile. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n **Now for your reward my love, that you have always desired** \n \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Bathsheba, my love, I am so happy to see you again, but I don't-'', his voice cut off, his mouth closed and his body jerked. The King, approached him and stiffly, went to one knee. \n \n & nbsp; \n \n In the bright, fresh morning the marketplace bustled with news. `` Hear yea, hear yea! ``, the red faced crier cried in the square, shaking his brass bell with a smile. `` The King's secret heir is returned, schooled abroad for safety he came in the night accompanied by his devilishly beautiful betrothed. The coronation of the new King shall be announced anon!'' \n \n\n"}

Now he tries desperately to replicate the event for someone else , so he wo n't end up alone for eternity .\n","story":"When he discovered he could n't die, he tried to imagine his wife aging. He thought he would be sad and lonely without her. He had imagined the histrionics, the keenly pained looks they would exchange, tears dripping off their faces to mingle on crisp white bedsheets. In reality he grew more and more disgusted with her. \n \n He sincerely tried not to be grossed out by her papery skin. He tried to sit with her in their rocking chairs on the porch, but could n't find anything new about the horizon to discuss after a couple decades. Her mind started to go, eventually, and all their shared history seemed to mean nothing, and soon all he could think about was how godawful boring it was to watch someone else age, even someone you had loved for so long. \n \n When her eyes finally closed forever, he was relieved. He was tired of pretending to be her grandson, and then her great-grandson. Glad to leave the town they'd settled in, where the old women admired him for his devotion before they succumbed to the same fate; all the while he had to see the young people all around him come into bloom, and not touch them. Now he was free to start over. \n \n In his new life, he watched an endless supply of young women's perfect bodies bloom into womanhood. They really are like flowers, he thought: their bodies were like plants whose entire life cycles were filmed and then sped up for his viewing. They grew and grew, their faces turned to the sun, and soon they erupted with life, pregnant with babies, possibilities. The seeds of life inside them were expelled and new flowers bloomed as they withered. Watching that process fascinated him, for a time. He fucked them, too, and for a time there was joy in that. \n \n But soon enough he wanted a companion. He watched a girl mature and then insinuated himself into her life. He liked her quite a bit, and he confided in her, and she married him with her eyes wide open. He had chosen a hearty mate this time, and they cavorted together for well over fifty years. He was kinder to her, in his mind, and forgave her slowing joints and the flab that eventually settled on her formerly taut body. Her mind and eyes were clear, and he cherished her as her body began to fail. But she eventually left him, too. She knew about his first wife, and the obligation he had felt to her, and she asked him to end her life. She would not fade away in the night like his first wife had - but he thought he would never forget the fear in her eyes, how she wrestled with it, as he held the gun under her chin. \n \n After he buried her, he did n't know what to do. This period of his life he devoted to exploration. First he saw everything he had n't seen yet: the poles, the jungle, peaks, caves, catacombs. He spent a few miserable years stuck in a claustrophobic hole in the ground, until he was finally found by a few curious spelunkers. They helped him out, but he had to kill them to keep his secret. Those deaths left an unpleasant taste in his mouth, and he decided not to kill again. It was then that he stopped eating. \n \n Then for a time he became obsessed with leaving Earth, but it was a futile effort unless he wanted to build his own ship, which was a complicated craft that he did n't have the patience for. He considered surrendering to some government or other, thinking that it might be nice to be understood, but he knew they would have questions he could n't answer. He did not often feel pain, but he thought if anyone could hurt him, it would be a bureaucrat. And anyway, his favorite government soon toppled, and lawlessness governed his homeland. \n \n He founded something like a commune, and came to think of the orphans who trickled into his care as something closer to pets than fellow people. He did n't hide his affliction from them, and they called him a god. Men and women infiltrated his borders and tried to slit his throat, and he laughed at the tickling of the knives. Once an enemy of his, whose name he would forget, bombed what he was fondly calling the Farm. The immortal man walked into his enemy's camp and killed them all, and this time he felt satisfied. \n \n He rebuilt the Farm with a more martial eye, and built an army. He expanded his territory by walking toward his enemies and dispatching them in whatever manner was available to him, only running into trouble when they restrained him, or if they managed to hole up where he could n't get to them. His army followed behind, and he allowed them to do whatever they liked. Eventually he met a force that he could n't overpower easily, and instead of leading his army into battle, he simply left. He heard later that most everyone died. \n \n He simply walked now. Planes and cars had fallen into disuse, and he disdained bicycles, preferring to move as slowly as possible. He sometimes met people, but did n't want their company. He made a movement suggesting he'd kill them, and they mostly chose to flee. \n \n Soon he came to the ocean. It was a lazy river to him, and he floated along the currents, leisurely, alone. He met no boats. When he finally ran aground on a new continent, he could n't find a soul. He wondered what had happened to his race, and went days and then months without setting eyes on another person. Eventually he grew frantic, and his dreamlessness felt like a new sort of madness. He began to see the people he had killed everywhere. His wives, the jolly explorers, his enemies, his armies of innocents. They looked back at him with accusing eyes, weeping eyes, with anger and sometimes forgiveness. He felt the most human he had ever felt. \n \n Finally, as he paced the equator, he found a little village of sickly humans. He called himself god, but could n't speak to them. He did n't know their language and desperately tried to pick it up \u2013 every day his heart pounded: he was afraid they were the last humans, and that they would die before he spoke to them. The men feared him and held their wives close. He did n't realize how he looked to them, with his tall thick body, born in a nutritious age. Only the children would have anything to do with him, and he learned their high-pitched tones and played with them, and felt happy again for a short while. \n \n But they were dying: poisoned, injured, deformed. The women tried to flower but their babies were too often born dead, and as often as not a man buried two thin bodies, with a little tiny baby nestled in the crook of the mother's still arm. It seemed that this would be humanity's final resting place. Sometimes at night he thought about his second wife, and he imagined pulling the trigger on this throat and burying these last humans, but when he saw the sun rise he forgot the bloody past and could n't see life without them. He imagined the histrionics, his pain, living without them. He imagined burying them, and watching the sun set without them. \n \n The last human was a little girl. After he buried the girl's father, she sickened, and he beat his chest and bashed his head against the wall of the mud hut, trying to remember how it had happened, what had changed, what was allowing him to survive them. He tore at his hair when she closed her eyes, and he wept when he returned to her, to listen to her ragged breathing. He held her close, trying to will his life into her lungs. He would die for her, if he could. He closed his eyes to the sunrise one more time, and he counted their breaths. He was grateful for every one of them.\n"}

Then the foundation begins to shake. \n \n At first we thought we were lucky to live on the bottom floor. That was until the floor above us collapsed, trapping us inside our apartment as the ground began to split. Dust filled the room and our lungs and clouded our vision. We looked for windows but the only thing guiding us was my cat Cheeto pawing at my legs. Maggie and her dog followed after us. \n \n I felt my feet upon a hidden stairwell made of stone leading us below our apartment. \n \n `` Where are we going?'' Maggie asked. \n \n `` Just trust me.'' I replied, squeezing onto her hand though even I was suspicious. \n \n Cheeto led us so far down that the earthquake disappeared like an after thought above us. \n \n `` Great, now we're trapped.'' Maggie said as we entered into a cave followed by a flood of rocks that buried the stairwell. \n \n Diesel stepped out from behind Maggie to sniff the cave wall and Cheeto did the same on the opposite side. A glowing blue line carved itself along the cave wall between them, and that blue line created an arch. A doorway. \n \n As Maggie and I stood in petrified shock Diesel barked for us to follow as he knocked open one side of the door with nose.\n"}

Despite you being normal , when she 's in danger she keeps summoning you first .\n","story":"The light that always blinded me when I was summoned faded away slowly. There was an equal amount of blinking and rubbing my eyes until the dark spots faded and I was able to look around at my new location. \n \n As always, I looked for Mira first. She was the only one who could summon me and only when she was in real danger. My eyes skipped over the smoke and the flames and the bodies and found her. Her arms, always so skinny, were wrapped around her legs. Her bony knees were scratched and bleeding and her clothing was torn and covered in soot. \n \n `` Mira!'' I stepped over some charred remains of what had once been a person and knelt before her, my hands scooping her and holding her close. She was so big now! I could have sworn it was just the other day that I could lift her up above my head and now she was looking like she was going to be taller than me some day. Where does the time go? What a strange thought to have at a time like this, but with a daughter, well... it's hard to forget the little girl with her chubby face smiling when daddy came home. \n \n `` Daddy!'' Mira cried into my shoulder. She had n't called me that for years. This must have been a bad one. I rubbed her back and told her over and over that I was here now, that she was going to be alright. \n \n `` I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I tried. I really did.'' Mira pushed against me and I let her go, she fell back onto the floor and I really looked into her face. Fire had scorched one of her eyebrows and the skin around it was red and raw. Seeing her hurt made tears well in my own eyes. \n \n `` I know you did, Mira. I know.'' I forced myself to smile at her, to let her know that I was n't mad... to show her that I was n't afraid. \n \n `` They...'' Mira looked toward the corner and I followed her gaze. Five corpses sat there, twisted and charred by fire. As I watched one of their hands, curled in anguish as they flailed in death, crumbled away into ash and fell to mix with the rest of the soot on the floor around them. \n \n `` They tried to kidnap me.'' Mira was looking down at the floor when I turned back toward her, `` They tried to cast a siphon-'' \n \n My heart ran cold inside my chest. I thought it had been long enough, I thought I'd done enough to erase her past. If one person knew, then... \n \n `` You did good, Mira.'' I wanted to hold her again. I wanted to steal her away again. She was n't a kid anymore though, she was growing up so fast. I had to tell myself that last part a few times as my hands shook, `` It's not your fault.'' \n \n `` I tried to warn them!'' Mira cried again, falling into me as I wrapped my arms back around her, `` I told them! I did!'' \n \n `` I know.'' \n \n `` The fuck?!?'' A gravelly voice broke into the moment. \n \n I turned to find a large man standing in the doorway on the other side of the room. I had n't even noticed the door there before, it had been partially obscured by a fallen support beam and the smoke from the still-burning fires. \n \n `` Who da fuck are you? Did you do this shit?'' The silhouette pushed forward, not even dodging around the fallen beam but instead pushing through it. I watched as the aged wood splintered and exploded as his chest touched it. It did n't even slow his walk for a second. \n \n `` Bastion.'' I said the magic group out loud so that Mira could hear me. I'd been teaching her about things like this. I had just hoped she'd never have to use the information. \n \n `` That's right.'' The Bastion Mage stalked forward, the world pushing away from him as he closed the gap, `` This idiots were supposed to lock that little shit down, I underestimated just how truly incompetent they were.'' \n \n `` You do n't know what you're messing with.'' I warned him as I stood up. Ash and debris fell from the ceiling onto my head but I tried to ignore it. A mage like this was one that required undivided attention. I had to keep every one of my normal human senses locked onto him, `` If you do anything to-'' \n \n `` Oh, shut up.'' \n \n I was on the floor before I realized he had even hit me. My ears rang and I was fairly certain there was blood covering one of my eyes. I tried to sit up and found that I could n't take a full breath. Broken rib? I looked down. A large chunk of the ceiling was on top of me as well as some of the furniture from the floor above us. I twisted around a bit more, looking for- \n \n Mira. \n \n She stood in the center of the room, standing right between myself and the Bastion Mage. He was a brute of a figure. He face was thick and scarred over a dozen times. He was casting. I could see it in his eyes. Magi like him always got that look when they were pulling magic. I tried to warn Mira. I tried to tell say something, anything... but I could n't. I did n't have enough in my lungs and I could n't pull in enough air either. \n \n `` Now sit down like a good little girl.'' Bastion showed his teeth, `` I've waited a long time for a meal like this. Kaasta Vonuska Di Siphon-'' \n \n The explosion ripped half of the building away. When I was able to look again all I could see was the open sky and the silhouette of my daughter. Standing there; shaking... crying. \n \n I had hoped so much... so hard that this would n't happen again. They did n't know how much power she held. They always underestimated it, they always planned to steal it without even thinking about how dangerous it was to unleash the seal on Mira's power. I could n't do much, but I did what I was able to do. I helped her be strong. I let her cry on my shoulder. I let her talk to me without showing fear in my eyes. She was my daughter, not a monster. I'd never look at her as anything but my little girl. \n \n `` Daddy!'' \n \n I sat back and closed my eyes as she summoned a stone golem to lift the debris off of me. She was amazing. She was so amazing. My little girl. \n \n\n"}

You realize that you 're actually controlling a real family .\n","story":"Ethan couldn \u2019 t wait to try out the game - from what he \u2019 d seen of the trailers, the graphics were eerily realistic. Though Sims 4 had been good, it had never been *quite* realistic enough for him. \n \n When he got home and popped in the CD, he began jotting out his plans for his first family. He couldn \u2019 t wait to get started. He built the house carefully: a pool surrounding them, a nice, roomy basement. A family of eight, six of them children. \n \n At first, it was the same as usual. His sims' needs plummeted as he deprived them of food and sleep. It was fun, but not exactly anything new. \n \n It was only when they started working together on their own, to escape the basement, that he begun to wonder. This wasn \u2019 t supposed to happen. One of the drawbacks of the game - they were just stupid, simulated people, doing exactly what he told them. Not like real people. *Real* people would act like this, would try to escape. \n \n His hands trembled with excitement as he tried to direct them. Some - like the smallest children - obeyed, while others appeared to be screaming directly at him. One of the parents refused to attack his own children like he \u2019 d ordered, instead breaking down in tears on the floor. \n \n There could only be one explanation. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re all real, aren \u2019 t you? You \u2019 re real, \u201d he whispered, leaning back from the computer as he considered the implications of this. \n \n If they were real, did that mean he was God? He \u2019 d always suspected, but this was surely a sign\u2026a signal. He turned his eyes on the sims again. Feverishly, lost in the dark world he had been afraid to imagine up to this point, he began to play in earnest. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ve got something, sir, \u201d agent Katherine Masters said, showing her supervisor the live feed of one of the webcams. \n \n A pale-faced young man \u2019 s eyes were lit with joy as he tortured a family of eight. \n \n \u201c Good job, Katherine, \u201d agent Daniel Simmons murmured, hastening over to check the feed for himself. \n \n As always, he felt slightly nauseous as he watched the man \u2019 s enraptured expression. \n \n Right from the start, the Sadism Identification Mechanism operation had been a massive pain in the ass to get approved and implemented. First there was the game \u2019 s development. It had been a long, tedious slog, to get the coding perfect - to make the sims behave as unpredictably as possible. \n \n Then the marketing - its number of sales were crucial to their operation \u2019 s success. And above all, getting approval to hack into the players \u2019 webcams. It would be a disaster if details of the operation became public, even though they abandoned most of the feeds after a week. Watching someone direct their sims to go to work and make pancakes was hardly a good use of their resources. \n \n But then there were others. \n \n The ones who made the red tape and headaches worth it. The ones who proved that the game could be a revolutionary tool to catch some perpetrators early. Those who would likely move on from torturing highly realistic, simulated people - to real people. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 ve got the address? \u201d he asked. \n \n \u201c All his details, \u201d Katherine confirmed. \n \n \u201c Keep watching him, \u201d Daniel said. \u201c We need more.'' \n \n Katherine started to reply, when they heard Ethan whisper something in a fervent tone, like he was praying. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re all real, aren \u2019 t you? You \u2019 re real, \u201d he said. Instead of seeming uneasy, the boy looked ecstatic. \n \n \u201c Delusions, \u201d Daniel noted. \u201c Interesting. Focus only on him for now, Katherine. \u201d \n \n She nodded, stifling a sigh. It was draining work, looking into these people \u2019 s eyes when they thought no-one was watching. It had already been a pain with the previous games. But somehow, the things she saw only got worse as the games got more realistic.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The lone plant you complain to about your day has had it . It has decided to take matters into it 's own hands .\n","story":"I grew. \n \n Slowly, yes, but I *do* grow. I can sense it as the tips of my leaves tingle, I know it when my roots dig deeper, I can feel the bud that is preparing to bloom. \n \n I feel vibrations through the ceramic of my pot. The creature, massive and moving, lumbers past, then stops. I ca n't see, but I can feel her presence, smell the air she breathes out. The sun that warms my leaves is blocked, briefly, as something is raised above me. A shower of water tumbles over my stem and soaking the soil. My roots seek the moisture out, and instantly, I feel invigorated. I give the tiniest of happy sighs. \n \n This creature that cares for me, gives me a place in the sun and gives me the water I need, she sits, heavily, in the chair that faces the window I am in. Many plants would not know this, would n't understand the names of the world around them. But there is a difference between me and the common potted petunia. \n \n `` Hey, pal. How's it going? Sorry that I nearly forgot to water you.'' \n \n The human that cares for me, *speaks* to me. \n \n She is the reason I know what the life giving liquid is called, the reason i know why my leaves grow cool at night. She tells me about her day, in a way that is almost poetic, describing the world around us. \n \n It started when she first got me. I did n't understand the vibrations that came from her mouth, not back then, but she had learned something about gardens growing better when you speak to them, giving them compliments and treating them well. Soon, her daily `` Hello, pal,'' turned into a sentence or two about what she enjoyed that day, or a description of the colors in the sunset, and now I'm the being she tells of her fears and joys, her confidant for secrets. \n \n I do n't think she knows I understand her, but I enjoy her ramblings. \n \n Today, she seems almost a bit more hesitant as she speaks, and I know she feels like crying. A huff of air ruffles me, a sigh. \n \n `` I'm sorry. Its just... Paul... Paul yelled again.'' \n \n I remember Paul. Her neighbor, a grouch, who spends his days mowing and keeping up his perfect yard. Bushes trimmed, grass green and perfectly mowed, even the trees get pruned on an almost daily basis. \n \n `` He hates how I keep my yard, and I can almost understand him. I just never seem to have the time to pluck weeds or mow. There's so many things I have to fit in my schedule, with the new job and taking care of you. I have to work late a lot, you know.'' \n \n She sighed again. `` Its just... I do n't see why he has to be so *mean* about it. Do n't tell anyone, but I think he assumes a yard is how to measure the worth of a person. He constantly holds his standards over my head, telling me that I'm an embarrassment to the neighborhood. I *try, * it just never seems good enough for him.'' Two thumps hit the windowsill next to me, and I know she's rested her elbows on it, to hold her head. `` I'm just not sure what to do about it.'' \n \n This is the third time in a week that she's had issues with Paul. I feel something, something different in me. I do n't like this Paul, and how he treats my friend. Surprised, I realise that... I'm *angry. * \n \n That in and of itself is unusual. Plants do n't get angry. \n \n ``... thanks for listening, pal. I've got some work to finish.'' Slowly, she stands, and walks away. \n \n As her footsteps fade, I ponder my new emotion. Why do I feel this way? What changed about me? I do n't like Paul. He's mean to her, and all I want is for her to be happy. \n \n And slowly, it dawns upon me that maybe, maybe I can do something about that. \n \n Slowly, I reach out with my roots. There's a crack in my pot at the bottom, and I've been tentatively exploring it for a couple days. But more important, just beyond that, is a gap in the windowsill, a way to the outside that the tips of my roots have barely managed to touch. \n \n There is a way to fix this. I set to work. \n \n After all, its the least I can do for her. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Over the next week and a half, I grow my roots. I take all the excess from my leaves and stem, and direct them down, instead of up. I wo n't grow taller, my bud wo n't bloom, but my roots... My roots spread like wildfire. \n \n Not that I like fire, mind you. \n \n They expanded put the window and through the wall, into the unadulterated dirt outside. Under the grasses and weeds, over the whole yard like a tangle of wires. \n \n And then I start by killing the weeds. \n \n Weeds, nasty, thoughtless things, that only exist to take up room where they are n't wanted. I have no qualms about destroying them. My roots easily encompass theirs, taking their nutrients and dragging them down. Their dead leaves act as a fertilizer to the grass, and I can feel it getting healthier, stronger. \n \n No more weeds, and grass as green as it could ever be. Paul has nothing to complain about now. \n \n But even the day I finished, she came in, sad again, and informed me that Paul had asked her if she even knew how to mow. `` I try to get around to it, really! But it takes so long, and I have no time. My boss keeps wanting me to work overtime, and I need the money.'' I could tell she was looking out the window, from the direction of her voice. Looking over at Paul, her oppressor. \n \n So I started killing the biggest blades of grass. I could tell, from the size of their roots, which ones were taller than the rest, and I treated them as I had the weeds. And soon after that, her yard was short, and, while if not even, did n't appear overgrown at all. \n \n But she came in another day, frustrated. `` He wo n't even tell me what's wrong with my yard anymore. Somehow, the grass got *shorter* without me doing anything, and he still thinks I'm a failure!'' While her voice was angry, I could hear the tears, the water that killed with its sadness and salt, threatening to burst through. I was beginning to suspect that she had problems at work as well, and that Paul was simply the reminder at the end of each day of her misery. \n \n I could still help, though. But with what? Her yard was as good as I could get it, and yet it would never compare to what Paul did, slaving away on his own side of the fence, cultivating the perfect gardens. \n \n So maybe I needed to try another tactic. \n\n"}

Molly found her roadhouse over-capacity and without nearly enough food to help the people that were now flooding through. She tried her best, but in the end had to hire guards from among some of the travelers to protect the old motel from attacks by caravans of people desperate for food and shelter. It had worked, but she regretted it now. Better that the place had gotten run down. \n \n She chewed on an old piece of straw and watched patches of fluffy clouds forming across the sky. Maybe they'd get some rain in the next few days. Lord knows they needed it. Molly was having to attach an old winch to the well to drag the water up. The wind had used to run the turbine above it bringing up fresh water every day, but the weather was n't as reliable as it used to be, and the ground was drier too. \n \n No one was at the roadhouse now. Sure, a few travelers came through every now and then chasing rumors of better futures to be found either East or West. Molly'd heard enough of them now to realize that they were n't true, but she never had the heart to pass that along to the people that rolled through. They'd be just as well off on one side of the country as the other and it would n't do any good to quell their already small hopes. \n \n A dust cloud forming on the eastern horizon signaled an oncoming traveler. She felt her gut tightening. Maybe they'd roll by but Molly doubted it. People seldom pass through here without stopping for at least one night to resupply. Her own supplies were meager, but she did well trading for rooms and food. Maybe they'd have enough gas to spare her some. Her tanks had run dry years ago, but people carried it these days in jerry cans to use for trade. \n \n It took the wagon almost half an hour to reach her after she caught her first glimpse of it. Sure enough, they turned in to one of the open spaces across the front of the building. She saw a man leading two mules as they pulled an overpacked wagon and a trailer, probably full of water. It was risky taking those thirsty animals across the plains with a limited supply, but she'd seen desperate people do stupider things. \n \n Molly hoped the man was the only one, but as a woman climbed between the mismatched curtains hanging across the door her heart sank. They were the fifth party to come through though and Molly had made a deal. Every fifth group was theirs. She hated every part of what she did, but she knew it was probably the only thing keeping the road open at all and she knew it saved more lives than it cost. Did n't make her any less bitter though. \n \n She stood and walked across the front of the dilapidated building where the couple were getting off the wagon. The paint had faded across the parking area and the `` E'' had almost fallen off the motel sign, but Molly made sure the rooms were kept in good repair and the sheets were clean. \n \n `` Howdy there!'' she said as she approached. `` Where're you folks headed?'' \n \n The man smiled at her as his partner blinked sleep out of her eyes. `` Out towards Cali, ma'am. Heard word of good farm work out thatta way.'' \n \n California had grown into a small nation and now covered most of the old Western US. Molly doubted there was any work there based on the talk she'd overheard from travelers coming from that direction, but who knows. Maybe something'd come up, she told herself. \n \n `` How long you planning on staying?'' she asked. \n \n `` We were hoping we could stay for a couple nights, and maybe refill our water if you have a well,'' he replied eyeing the old windmill. \n \n `` You're gon na have to say some prayers for rain tonight if you want any water. And you'll have to winch it yourself, but if it rains it's yours. What do you have to trade? Got any gas?'' \n \n The man looked a little crestfallen about the water. Evidently, they were running a little low. He perked up though when she asked about the gas. `` Sure do ma'am. Got a ten gallon drum in the back and I'm sure the mules will be happy to see it go,'' he said with a wink. \n \n `` Done,'' Molly said reaching out her hand and shaking his. The bartering would n't matter in a couple days, but they would expect it. No point in arousing suspicions. `` Room for two then? You're the only guests right now and I've got a lovely little space for ya.'' \n \n `` Actually-'' started the man, but he was cut off from a high pitched voice from the door of the wagon. \n \n `` Daddy, where are we?'' A little girl, no more than seven was looking out from the curtains, rubbing sleep away from her face. A little boy, probably four, shoved by her as she spoke and looked around. `` Yuck,'' he said. \n \n Molly's heart dropped. Not kids. Not now. Who would think it was okay to drag their kids across this wasteland? And in a wagon. She stared at them and tried to think of a solution, but nothing was coming to mind. \n \n `` -and drag the drum over to the shed if you'd like? Molly?'' The man's voice cut into her thoughts and she realized she'd missed the first half of what he'd said. \n \n `` What? Oh, yes, of course. The gas can go right to the shed. I'll roll it in and lock it later. So, a bigger room then. Let me see what I can do.'' Molly bustled back towards the motel, her mind racing. She knew she had to do something, but what?\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Much more rare , potentially powerful and dangerous than selling your soul to the Devil is selling your soul to God\n","story":"I had asked for amnesty repeatedly. I had asked for salvation when there was no one to give it to me, I had asked for a cool hand on my hot forehead, I had asked for a warm embrace when I shivered, I had asked for relief from split lips and thirst. \n \n \n \n I had also asked often for death. \n \n \n \n One might think an office cubicle to be a cage, but to be literally within a cage as a human creature stuffed tight against bars, that's another feeling. And we were slowly starting to overcrowd. The sullen teenager to my left was a new one, with freckles on her cheeks and bright blue eyes. She was shoved in roughly, her shock of pink dyed hair tangled up in dirt and leaves. \n \n \n \n He must have dragged her in the dirt. \n \n \n \n At first, we never know why we were taken. All we know is that he was cruel, and spent particular time to remind us that we had sinned, with ire, restriction of necessities, or worse. In this case, I was well aware of why I was here. The girl next to me had no verifiable idea; or perhaps she did not know yet. Perhaps her memories had been landscaped in apropos. \n \n \n \n `` You got ta figure it out, or he wo n't feed you,'' I offered. \n \n `` Fuck that! I'd rather starve!'' she spat. \n \n \n \n \n I had been like that too, once. Culled from my office job one night after drinking a fair bit too much. Barbara from accounting was flirting with me, and I, as any hedonistic worshipper of the flesh, had gone down that split path. My fiance did n't know. It was n't like I did n't love her, it was just that my longing for my own pleasures was immense. \n \n \n \n This was why I was here. And I had accepted it long ago. Now lean, no longer muscled, face gaunt and pale to match my own pale hair. I had wished often for death. But it would not come. \n \n \n \n \n And then I received a choice, in hushed words from the blank eyed man that kept us caged. On this day, the girl next to me named Olivia -- I had learned as she sobbed out her life story in gasps and tremors -- quaked once more. She found my hand through the bars and I held it. She was barely over sixteen. And she also heard the words, the choice. \n \n \n \n `` You are allowed one. Either the light and grace of Him, our Lord and savior, God almighty.'' \n `` Or, the darkness and deceit of the Liar's tongue -- Satan.'' \n \n \n `` Which do you choose?'' \n \n \n \n \n I did n't understand. \n \n `` W..what?'' \n \n `` You must pick one. You have suffered as a martyr for your sins. Do you wish to absolve yourself of sin, wash it clean away, or live in sin eternal?'' \n \n \n \n He was out of his fucking mind, and his hot breath on my face as he knelt was a reminder of how sick he was, inside, and out. His heavy mouth sucked his lips and teeth and asked again. \n \n \n `` What do you choose?'' \n \n \n \n ``... God. God, I guess.'' \n \n \n \n \n \n `` Are you sure?'' \n \n \n I tossed a look at Olive who held my hand tight and sobbed. The others began to flutter and cry and I stared up under heavy brows as I grasped her hand. This man must have spoken for God as he preached about sin relentlessly, and the cross upon his neck had caught my attention on more than one occassion. I'd play this game. \n \n \n \n `` No. I choose Satan.'' \n \n \n \n The man tossed a grin and waited for pale, fragile Olive's response. Her pink hair was matted and she had n't eaten in a week. \n \n \n \n \n ``...... God?'' \n \n `` Are you sure?'' \n \n ``.....yes....'' \n \n \n \n \n \n He ripped her cage open and tried to drag her out. My hand latched to her's and I scrambled to keep ahold as she cried and scratched to stay by my side, but he had taken her. She screamed out as he took her away and then slammed the door. My hand was empty but I still held it out. I still felt her grip and her weight. \n \n \n \n She was gone. \n \n \n \n \n When she returned later, she was not herself. Her eyes seemed dull, and a spit of blood trailed from her eye socket. A popped blood vessel. She sat outside of her cage. She sat in a plain wooden chair and stared into nothingness. \n \n \n \n `` She has been purified.'' \n \n `` What the fuck does that mean?'' \n \n ``....she is of God now.'' \n \n \n \n \n I stared, my mouth raw and blistered. \n \n \n \n \n `` She is of miracles now. Watch,'' he said simply, smacking his rough lips together. Olive stood gently and touched my face. Without emotion affect or words, she blessed my forehead and I felt full and happy....this was real. This was actually happening. \n \n \n \n ``....that's... amazing.'' \n \n \n `` Can she hear us?'' \n \n \n `` No.'' \n \n \n \n \n `` Never again will she talk as mortals do. She is an angel.'' \n \n \n \n \n \n God had given her the gift to fill the hungry, quench the thirsty, heal the wounded, and potentially raise the dead. But she was not herself. There was no life in that miracle. A strain of red fell from her eyesocket and she cried tears as the statues of Mary had. \n \n \n \n \n \n ``... what is my gift then?'' \n \n `` Excuse me?'' \n \n `` My gift. She has miracles, what do I have?'' \n \n \n `` Damnations. You judge the sinners, as I do now. And take them, as I have... you have a power they do not. It is to harm, as her's are to heal.'' \n \n \n \n \n \n I took it to mean I judged sinners. Every sinner. And with this, seeing her shallow form, waifish, pale, but glowing, pink hair alight with an internal goodness -- but knowing she was no longer sentient, but lobotomized by God's light, I judged... that this man here, was a sinner. \n \n \n \n \n The cage flew open without much thought and I pressed out of it, to finally stand, as I had n't been able to in weeks. \n \n \n \n ``... I will train you.'' \n \n \n \n `` No, you wo n't.'' \n \n \n \n \n With less than an intake of breath I had stabbed him through the chest with my fist. The others cried, some cheered, others wretched into their own cells. The rest of the cells split open with my pale blue gaze. He stood with my fist clutching his heart, perfectly still. \n \n \n ``..w... why have you forsaken me, Father?'' \n \n \n \n \n `` I can judge anyone as a sinner, right? If God does this, then he too, has sinned. Man was n't meant to live in a cage. Not in his own body, and certainly,'' I ripped. `` Not behind metal.'' \n \n \n \n \n \n He slammed into the ground as the others escaped and huddled, crying. Olive sat staring at me and dropped the man's dead meat onto the ground, bloodied hands now on her face. She said nothing, but I kissed her forehead and she managed to blink. \n \n \n \n `` Let's go, pepto.'' \n \n \n \n She complied, and we left. The authorities scooped up the others and I took off with my little miracle in the passenger seat of a car I lifted. It had been easy. The air whipped her pink hair and I glanced at her, bloody hands finding a cigarette. She saw nothing, really. But did she understand? \n \n \n \n \n ``... can you hear me?'' \n \n \n \n \n She passed a gentle hand to my shoulder and I felt a crack. She had fixed the pressure of the punch, pulled apart and reorganized tendons. We would do this ourselves. \n \n \n \n The way it was meant to be done. \n \n\n"}

I could barely make out the words through the drugs he used to knock me out. I was still regaining consciousness... I needed to bide my time. look for a way out. \n \n `` Yeah, okay, a secret. sure. Sit down. I need a minute.'' I knew it was n't going to buy me much time. but my mind was still reeling, and I had to take stock of my surroundings. a dingy old basement, an old boiler pipe sticking out of the wall, looks rusted. might be able to kick it loose? Oh, sees my hands are taped together. `` you have n't got long kid.'' he tells me. `` Or do you wan na join the others?'' \n \n I just smile and say `` What would be the fun in that? you would n't get to hear my secret. and mines the greatest secret there is. Better than even yours.'' He gives a short loud laugh, loud enough to tell me I ca n't yell for help. I'm on my own. My phone wo n't get reception down here... `` You think you know anything about me kid?'' \n \n `` You're a serial killer, one of the most vicious in years. I've watched the news. I've heard about what you did. You're messed up. You killed alot of innocent people.'' He stands up and brandishes his knife large and sharp. `` well they would n't share, so I had to take something from them. Looks like you're going to do the same thing.'' \n \n He begins to approach and I say. `` Oh I'll share... When you sit.'' He stops. `` Once you sit down, I promise greatest secret yet. If not, kill me. I wo n't even fight back.'' he sneers at me and says. `` I like it when they fight.'' \n \n `` then You'll love me. Sit.'' He grabs an old metal chair from the corner and sits down. He's a large guy, but despite it's shambled state and his size It holds. Excellent. now one final thing. I need a weakness... \n \n `` You're s serial killer...'' I say starting off. and he gets frustrated, getting up. ``... and so am I.'' this stops him cold in his track. unsure of what he heard. `` come again?'' \n \n `` I'm a serial killer.'' \n \n The words hang in the air like I had said'I'm from pluto.' `` Bullshit.'' he finally says after a moment. \n \n `` I... Am... A... serial... Killer...'' \n \n It's true, sort of... `` Then how come I have n't heard of you? Only bodies popping up in the media are mine.'' He says, with a confused inquiring tone of voice. I definitely have his interest. `` I could lie.'' I start explaining. `` and say that I hide my activities well, making my victims look like accidents. or do all my killing overseas on vacation. but the truth is, I have n't killed anyone. but the urge? the compulsion? It's there. that little voice at the back of our minds, That Demon screaming at us To kill. to see the blood of others running over our hands. to see the light go out in their eyes.'' \n \n My words have an effect on him. and frankly, on me too. I've always done well to fight that urge. For all I know I could be the one person strong enough to fight it. But then, he starts to pace. \n \n He considers what I'm saying. and scratches his face. and I watch as he walks. Preferring to stay on his right foot. as his left comes down his left knee seems to give way, just for an instant... YES! A weakness! \n \n `` alright, lets say I believe you, which I do n't. why have n't you killed anybody. you say you have that need... you some kind of pussy?'' \n \n I simply smile and say. `` ah, but that's my secret, I'm stronger than you. I'm strong enough to resist the urge to kill. every day my demon tells me'kill them, kill them all.' and I say No.'' He shakes his head and says `` Nope, not buying it kid. sorry, but times up.'' he raises His knife and I strike. \n \n he's given me to long, my head is clear. I charge suddenly. getting up from the floor and pouncing, tacking him and striking his left knee all at once. He falls to the floor in a heap and I go for the rusty pipe. His knife fly's across the basebent floor and He chases after it. \n \n I manage to get the pipe between the opening in the duct tapped hands. The tape which had been restraining me, now only helps me hold my make shift weapon. \n \n He turns to me just in time to see the pipe strike his face. I see some blood, and I do n't know if I've killed him, or Just knocked him unconscious. No time to worry about that, he's not moving. \n \n After a good ten minutes, I manage to get the tape off my hands. then I look at my would be killer. I notice his chest, still moving. He's alive? and helpless... \n \n No one would miss him, and he would n't get to hurt anyone else... oh to finally feed that monster in my soul. I was n't lying about that by the way.I roll him over and tape his hands behind his back. Then I spot a rope he hand in the corner near where I woke up. thank god I woke up before He could restrain me better. \n \n Once I'm sure he's not getting out I head upstairs and pull my cellphone out of my pocket. I dial 911 and let them know what happened. minus confessing about my urges of course. \n \n He's pulled out the basement, of course by now he's conscious again. He looks at me as they are hauling him away and he says `` I know you're secret! I know your secret!'' I'll never forget the look he gave me with those mad eyes. I imagine it was the same look he had on his face when they gave him the lethal injection. I was there for that. \n \n The police question me about my encounter with the serial killer, ask me how I escape They give me a funny look and say `` You have a knack for getting yourself in trouble do n't you?'' \n \n I feign innocence. `` what do you mean officer?'' he opens up my file and says to me. `` says here, you were involved in a gang shootout two years ago...'' Involved? I non-violently subdued two wanted fugitives single-evenhandedly. `` then you prevented a domestic disturbance.'' Of a man who had been involved in organized crime. had to skip town after that. `` Now you managed to find one of this cities worst serial killers.

And now, for the first time, I was sitting in the president's desk in the oval office. My desk. My office. Even then, I had trouble believing it was true, that I had n't snuck in past the Secret Service and illicitly planted my undeserving posterior on the president's chair. Yet here I was, and here I sat. \n \n The Resolute Desk. My desk. Made from the timbers of the sailing ship HMS Resolute and gifted by the British to us Yankees in the year 1890. First moved into the Oval Office during the Kennedy administration, at Jackie's urging. I knew everything there was to know about the White House; my mother had made sure of that. Her little boy was going to be president, she declared, and a president-to-be must know everything there was to know about presidents, even a little one at the tender age of four. I hope she's proud now, whichever world she's watching from. A shame it's not this one, but a president never cries, not even a little one. \n \n I spent some time going through its drawers, and the old timbers, worn and smoothed by time and use, began feeling familiar beneath my shaking hands. Welcoming, even. Somehow, this desk I had never sat in before began feeling like home. \n \n The only uncertainty left, of course, was the button. The big red one. The only one. The secret service men only mumbled and shrugged when I asked them about it; it must have not maimed or mangled any past presidents if that was their reaction, but they had no more words for me. \n \n Well, here goes nothing. \n \n *BWRP* \n \n The button sinks down with a solid clunk. \n \n *CHHNK* \n \n A trap door flaps open beneath my feet. \n \n I peer down. The two flaps have opened into a low platform. Beyond it, a flight of stairs leads into a long, scarcely-lit hallway. Only one way to find out where it leads. Carefully, I push the chair back and climb down the stairs, into the unknown. I creep down the hallway, my Italian leather shoes kicking up the thick dust that covers the ground. I grope blindly in the dim light; I make one turn, then another. The darkness denies any sense of time or distance. I stumble and nearly fall once, and then again. I feel with my foot; they find steps leading upward. Cautiously I work my way up; fumbling in the dark, my hands find a door, then a doorknob. My pulse pounding, my head throbbing, I close down and turn the knob. It opens. \n \n Dusty, sweaty, and completely exhausted, Marcus Li, President of the United States of America, stumbles into the light.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In the near future , games are fully immersive and almost indistinguishable from real life . Every year the top ranked player in each game is chosen for a `` Wonderful '' unknown prize . This year you are chosen .\n","story":"I do n't know how many thousands of hours it took to get to that spot. I do n't know how many thousands more it took to maintain it. Eyes glued to the clock, finally my phone buzzed. \n \n At first, my friends all told me that I was addicted. That these games were consuming me. Funny how they all shut up so quickly once they tried it for themselves. See, it's not an addiction. People do n't get addicted to these games. Well, not me at least. The way I see it, in a game that feels identical to life, but with so fewer limitations, are n't we missing out on life's possibilities if we choose not to experience what these games offer? Once we're free from the limitations of reality it would be a waste, a damn shame even, to squander that opportunity. \n \n \n It's the first time that they're running this event. `` The # 1 spot on the leaderboard will receive a special prize from the devs at the turn of the year''. Not that people really needed another incentive to play more. With the release of'Dream World', I took it upon myself to see this as a challenge. Something that I, and I alone, could experience above everyone else. \n \n \n The game was like Sim City plus Minecraft on steroids. You get to carve and build your world from every known material, and immerse yourself in a fantasy world of your own. The limitations are only set by your imagination. I was n't particularly interested in the logistics of it all, though. What this represented was n't a new pastime, but an opportunity to set foot on ground zero of this game and get a jump start ahead of everyone else. To be the first in history to feel something new. \n \n \n My empire put the Romans to shame. The cities I built, the mountains I raised, the forests I crew, the rivers I dug, and all the people I spawned. I'm sure taking the time to experience all that I had created would be amazing in itself, but there was n't any time to throw away doing all that. I could do that anytime. My home setup would be envied by the most die-hard of Korean eSports players. Automated food deliveries, efficient waste disposal. Everything I need to maximize my hours. I even trained my sleep schedule to be able to maintain smaller doses of rest each day. I knew it would all be worth it. \n \n \n I was proud of the world I had created. On December 31st, I knew I had secured my place at the top. It had been months since I hit # 1 on the leaderboard, and the gap between the next down and I was far too large to close in one day. Between the number of living things it housed, the quantity of materials used, and the stability of each system it encompassed, my world was unbeatable. \n \n At 11:45 PM I removed my headset. I should n't have been so tense! Why would I ever be worried? My victory was already guaranteed. Maybe I was afraid that this `` wonderful gift'' would underwhelm me? But even so, I would still be the first. All those thousands of hours of labor brought me to that moment. The clock turned. My phone vibrated with one new message. \n \n \n `` Dear player; from the developers of'Dream World', \n \n Congratulations! Your account has been confirmed as the number one spot on the overall leaderboard at end of the year! You have been chosen to receive a special prize at...........'' \n \n I did n't read the rest. I knew what it would say. All I saw was a green button that said `` click to receive''. I never clicked so hard in my life. The minute that the'processing' screen hung on my email felt like it dragged on for eternity. Then at last, the final message appeared on my screen. \n \n `` Your gift has been sent and should arrive in the next few minutes. Thank you for playing!'' \n \n \n \n Darkness. \n \n \n \n No phone reception, no internet, no lights working, nothing. What a hilarious time for a blackout. Everything was dead. I just had to sit and hope that the lights would come back on soon and I could get my reward. If not, what did I work all that time for? What did I build such a deep and complex world for? \n \n I could hear the fireworks coming from down the street. The green and blue bounced off my walls and off the my computer screen. As I waited for hours, I fell asleep on my computer chair. \n \n \n Waking up a few hours later, I hit the power button immediately. Still nothing. I swear I would've punched through my screen in my rage if I was n't so desperate for this reward. My desk has got a hefty dent on it now and my neighbors probably like me a little less. Now since my phone was n't working, I had to go outside, catch a bus downtown and get the mechanic yo my house in person. *This* is not how I imagined spending my New Year's Day. \n \n \n Still dark outside, I made my way onto the front porch. Hoping that maybe a letter or parcel would be lay there in wait. But to my discontent, there was nothing. I made my way out of my apartment and up to the top of the hill toward my bus stop. And there, on the peak of that summit, ever piece fell into place. I finally understood. \n \n \n And never since that day have I seen a brighter sunrise.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ OT ] Research : How and why do prompts help us ?\n","story":"There's really no way to define, objectively, what makes a good or bad prompt. That sort of thing is going to be different to each and every writer; what one writer could n't make a bedtime story out of, another might be able to weave a Homeric epic. Writers and their strengths are going to vary tremendously, and for those of us looking to maintain or even improve our skill with the written word, prompts act as the flint and stone to help get the fire going. \n \n That said, my personal idea of a good prompt? A solid concept is the most concise way I can put it; an idea that - while fully realized - is only exactly that. Very little about setting or characters or where the prompter implies the story *should* go, but the general idea behind the prompt itself illustrated clearly and explicitly enough so that writers know exactly what's being asked of them regardless. It's hard to strike that balance in a prompt, mostly because the line between not enough information and too much information is a very blurred line indeed. Generally speaking; the *less* a writer has on the specifics of a situation and the more a writer has on the *gist* of a situation, the better the story will turn out. Bad prompts generally go too far in the opposite directions. Either the idea is too nebulous to really latch onto or the prompt is so very specific that it's clear what the prompter is looking for without any real input from the writers. \n \n Now, why do prompts help us? Some of us like to write in a particular genre or to write characters with such and such traits ( I'm a repeat offender of this, just about every NaNoWriMo protagonist of mine has just been me in some form or another ) and dislike deviating from those patterns. But there's so much more to our individual abilities and imaginations that can be unlocked. A prompt helps writers get out of those comfort zones. A *good* prompt will intrigue the writer enough to say `` Yeah, sure, what the hell? ``.\n"}

He hit the mute button on the TV remote, picked up the phone, and watched the silent screen. \n \n \u201c Hello? \u201d \n \n He could see a new image on the screen.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Every night you must wind up your heart with a key on a necklace . After a one night stand , you wake to find the key missing and a note by your bed .\n","story":"It is difficult to move now. Each foot fall seems to take an eternity. Each twitch of a muscle bleeds a little more life out of me. I do it anyway. The window is at the end of the hallway and I must see the sun rise. Thirty paces away. \n \n I had a human heart once. I was a man like any other. I loved a woman named Sarah. Her lips were soft like freshly picked heather. and the sun danced golden rays in her hair. \n \n Twenty eight paces. \n \n After a long courtship she agreed to be my bride. We were wed in a little church overlooking the cliffs. The ocean sparkled like crushed diamonds and the birds sang merrily. When I held her hand in my that day I felt my heartbeat intertwine with hers. We were two beings forged incomplete in this world but, by change, we had found what made us whole. I, as a person, was nothing compared to what we were together. I thought I had reached the zenith of perfection then. The epoch of happiness. I could never feel more joy than this. Yet, being proved wrong did not wound me. \n \n Twenty two paces now. \n \n Her name was Emily and she was my darling Sarah reborn while, at the same time, more awe inspiring. This did not diminish the beauty nor the glory of her mother. On the contrary, coming even close is more than most could ever hope to obtain. I loved them. I know I did. I lived because of them. When little Emily could not sleep because the wind howled or the storms raged she would climb into bed between Sarah and me. I would lie awake and listen to their breathing settle and try to match my own breaths to theirs. When I knew they were asleep I would grasp their hands. Sarah's delicate hand in my left and Emily's tiny hand in my right. I would calm myself and feel their faint pulses interlocking with the beating of my heart. \n \n Twenty paces. \n \n The world turned to gray three years ago. I remember colors before then but, now, do they still exist? When others gaze out upon the ocean do they see a gray desert of water that can never slake one's thirst? Do other see a colorless sun scorching the grounds beneath us? An empty void above and unfulfilled promises below. Do others see this? Or is it just me? Maybe the entire world lost color the day I received that phone call and was told of the accident. \n \n Fifteen paces. Halfway there. \n \n I rushed to St. James Hospital. A gray nurse stood outside the door and would not let me in. They were in surgery, she said. The doctor's were doing all they could to save their lives. Those gray doors set deep within the gray frame of an even darker gray wall. I could n't make the nurse understand. My heart was in there! It was under those gray lamps where gray men with their gray knives gathered round. That was my heart they were being careless with! If I did not feel their heartbeats again how would my heart know to beat? \n \n Twelve paces. \n \n Sarah and Emily died two days later. Mother and daughter died within an hour of each other. I sometimes think Sarah let go first so she could go ahead and be there for our daughter on the other side. To hold her hand, to lock their hearts together once more, and wait for my hands to complete the circle. Maybe they are still there waiting for me. \n \n Ten paces. Please. I must go on. My heart beats are weaker now. Slow sluggish beats that barely give me the strength to lift my foot off the floor. My steps are slow and halting now. Just ten more beats, heart. Please. You owe that to me. \n \n I took to winding my heart up after that. I kept the key around my neck on a chain. A chain that belonged to my wife. A plastic key that belonged to my daughter. Every night, just before I would call for the sleep to end another gray day, I would insert the key in the hole in my chest left behind with their passing. A hole that had been carved by an automobile accident I had not been in. I would then twist the key over and over again, tightening the mainspring inside myself, and reminding my heart how to go on. \n \n Eight paces. My left foot feels as if it has been nailed to the floor. I no longer have the strength to lift it. In desperation, I push. It resists momentarily. The varnished wooden floor seems to offer too much resistance. Then, slowly, it moves forward. I shift my weight to my left foot and push the right foot forward. \n \n Gray day after gray day with my mechanical heart ticking away inside me. Some days the skies poured gray rain. Other days gray snowflakes drifted down upon my head. I moved. I breathed. My heart ticked. I existed. But I did not live. I could not. How could I? Without a heart, I was just an automaton parodying human movements. That was until the woman with the red dress stepped into the coffee shop. \n \n Three more paces. I could do this. My joints were freezing as if sand were trapped in their workings. My eye lids creaked with the effort to blink. My heart ticked, but softer now. Each tick a shadow of the one that proceeded it. If I tripped here I could fall the last few paces but I needed to be upright to see through the window. I bid my legs to carry me just a bit further. My feet were numb and leaden things that no longer belonged to me. But my legs. Surely they could still obey my final request. My hips flexed and dragged one of my useless feet forward. \n \n Two paces! \n \n Coffee was one of the few bits of color in my gray world. It was still black. I drank it without pleasure nor did it give me relief from the chains of sleep. I drifted through life feeling nothing and I visited the coffee shop out of habit from my time before. A time when colors still ran and hearts still beat. I was turning to exit the shop when I found myself almost blinded. A woman entered and she was wearing red. The first color I seen since that gray day with they even grayer phone call. How did this color arrive? \n \n One pace and my legs refused to give me any more. My body was frozen. My heart had almost wound down. To come so far and now to fail with my goal right before me. \n \n I felt something for the first time when I saw her. Wonder mixed with outrage, I suppose. How dare this color intrude on my world of gray? Yet, at the same time, I marveled at it. The nostalgia of a world of color, of sensations, and of life. For years my life had been played out with clockwork precision. My feet carried me from work to home on the same tracks every day. For the first time in years I felt the urge to leave these tracks. I stepped over to the girl and introduced myself. \n \n We drank coffee together. I forced a unfamiliar smile to my frozen lips. She laughed and I feigned laughter in return. She talked and I listened. I did what I could to pretend not to be a hollow shell in the guise of a man. Somehow we ended up at my apartment later on. I never even knew her name. \n \n *Tick^tick^tick* It was fading. Only a few more ticks before my heart is completely wound down. From below I feel something warm that fills my hollow body. Something I have n't felt in years. This raw emotion burns with a heat that my cold shell has all but forgotten. The heat of desperation. My legs no longer obey me. My arms no longer obey me. My head just barely does. I let it go. I let my neck bow to the weight that has been pressing down on it for years. I let the gray world knock me off my feet. But I am now falling forward. \n \n I awoke just awhile ago and remembered that I had forgotten to wind my heart the night before. I groped about the night stand in the cold gray light of pre-dawn for the key. It was missing. As was the girl in red. All I found was a note waiting for me. A note I could just barely make out in the light of a new day. \n \n *Dear Paul, * the note read. Only then did it occur to me that I never told the woman my name either. \n \n *I'm sorry. I was not honest with you last night and find it difficult to be honest with you now. I am a coward, I know. I left today while you were still sleeping. But, I know that if anyone could understand why I do this now, it would be you. * \n *Days have been gray since the day I lost my husband. You should know the day well, Paul. It has left its mark on both of us. Two cars, Paul, and three lives lost. Five if you could us. Do we count, Paul? Are we survivors or not? * \n *I loved Mark. Maybe I should have told him that more often than he did. Was it my fault he was on that road? We had just had a fight earlier in the day and he had stormed out of the door. Angry at me. Angry at himself too, I suppose. Was he still angry when his car struck the other? Or had he forgiven me by then? I know it should n't matter, but it does. Will he be waiting for me with open arms or will the pain still drive him away from me? * \n *I ca n't face him until I know, Paul. I just ca n't. When I lost my own key I felt something for the first time. Fear. I was afraid to face my missing heart without knowing if it had been lost or if it had abandoned me. * \n *I am selfish and I am a coward, Paul. I stole your key. I know this is wrong and I am taking your life away from you twice. Why does everything I do seem to damage you, Paul? I would ask for your forgiveness, but I deserve none. I would ask for you not to curse me because I curse myself. All I ask is that if you see Mark do not tell him what I have done. If these years have been as unkind to you as they have been to me, would you spare me that one small kindness? * \n *Love, June* \n \n My head struck the glass of the window. The ticking in my chest fluttered. It would fail soon enough. In the meantime I watched a golden ball of light rise above the horizon bathing the fields in green and causing the waters to dance once more. The shadows that had grown long during the night were now in retreat and the song of a birds filled the day. And, if I closed my eyes and concentrated, I thought I could feel two ghostly hands gripping my own with their faint heartbeats seeking out my own.\n"}

As quickly as he had stamped down on me, he dropped to his knees and pinned me to the floor, his hands tight around my throat.

{"prompt":"[ TT ] Dragons are real , they 've been dormant in the deep for thousands of years and now they began to emerge\n","story":"Now that he was unemployed, Mr. Robbin had no time for fun, or pranks, which is what he called the horse that appeared on their back stoop one gray October morning. He hadn \u2019 t put his glasses on yet. But he could tell by the blurry brownness of the thing, and the whinnying grunts, that it was clearly a horse. The creature was somehow shoved between the two iron railings of the back porch concrete steps, his broad flat head facing the door. \n \n There was just enough room for Mr. Robbin to open the back door, which swung directly into the horse \u2019 s nose. He stepped outside. The horse wheezed as the door hit its face. Mr. Robbins stared up at it ( its head was just above his ) in disbelief and his broad cheeks turned an angry pink. \n \n \u201c What -- what? Is this a joke? A joke, it must be a joke. And I don \u2019 t have time for this. \u201d \n \n Nell Robbin, Mr. Robbin \u2019 s daughter, peered out from the window, her eyes wide. The creature on the porch wobbled gently back and forth and then sighed in frustration. She could tell the horse wasn \u2019 t going to go anywhere, although that didn \u2019 t prevent her dad from shouting at it. \n \n She could also tell that it wasn \u2019 t a horse. \n \n \u201c Get out of here. Shoo! Go on, get out of here! \u201d Mr. Robbins stepped back inside, grumpily slamming the screen door behind him, \u201c Ugh. \u201d \n \n \u201c Dad, that \u2019 s no horse, \u201d Nell said quietly. Nell was a tall, gangly eleven-year-old child with a cowlick in her hair that made her bangs stick up on the side. Her father helped her do her hair in the morning. He did as best as he could, but lacking any hair himself he hadn \u2019 t very much practice. Nell was dressed for school in leggings and a long baggy dress. \n \n Her father continued shouting, so Nell grabbed his shoulder. \n \n \u201c Dad! It \u2019 s not a horse! \u201d Nell said loudly, \u201c Put on your glasses! \u201d \n \n She ran to his desk, plucked his horn-rimmed spectacles from the mess of papers, and shoved them at him. Walter grimaced and put them on. He was dressed in a raggedy t-shirt and sweatpants, but with his glasses on he looked a little like a proper teacher again. In fact, he looked more intelligent with his glasses on. \n \n \u201c It's-it \u2019 s-buh....wuh.... \u201d Her father stammered, ruining the effect, `` What is THAT?'' \n \n \u201c It looks like a dragon, \u201d Nell replied. \n \n The creature, whatever it was, was a dull sort of coppery colored reptile, with wings tucked tightly against its back. And it had human-like eyes, except that the irises were fluorescent yellow. It blinked at Nell through the screen door and grunted in frustration. \n \n \u201c Whatever you are, get off my porch! \u201d Mr. Robbins yelled at it. \n \n In response to her father \u2019 s sputtering, the dragon hung its head low across the metal railing, and its long neck wilted like a thirsty flower stem. It began to struggle, jerking from side to side. The porch railings creaked but held steady. \n \n Nell \u2019 s father \u2019 s hands dropped to his sides, hanging loosely. His eyes looked dull and sad. Unemployment did not suit him. When he \u2019 d still been a teacher, his eyes were bright and he \u2019 d been quick to smile. But after the town \u2019 s grade school closed and consolidated with the city school, the light seemed to fade from her father \u2019 s eyes more each day. Even his anger at the dragon didn \u2019 t have much of a spark. \n \n \u201c Where did this\u2026 creature come from? Who did this? \u201d Mr. Robbins said, his voice cracking. He glanced in the direction of the Gusky boys \u2019 yard. The Gusky \u2019 s were notorious troublemakers who lived next door. Of course, this thing looked like a dragon, but it surely was n't real. Maybe this was one of their tricks. \n \n Nell stuck her head out the back door, although she did n't step out. She just stuck her long pointed nose out, one dark eye peering down like a raven \u2019 s. \n \n \u201c Dad, I think he \u2019 s too stuck to move himself. He \u2019 s huge! I don \u2019 t know how he could have fit himself in there without help. And he \u2019 s not going to get out of there without us helping him. \u201d She said. Someone must have pushed, pulled, and shimmied the dragon forward between the two metal railings. He was as snug as a pillow in a too-tight pillowcase. The railings bulged out a bit, following the curves of the creature \u2019 s broad rib-cage. He appeared strong, even frightening, but the dragon must have been quite weak. Throughout his struggles, the black metal railings hardly shook at all. \n \n Mr. Robbins wagged his hands in frustration, and then went back inside. He walked to the front of their house, out the front door and went around. Now that he was gone, there was enough room for Nell to stand on the porch, and she stood there and looked at the dragon. She nervously put a hand against his forehead and pushed. To her surprise, the scales were n't slimy. They were warm, and rough like sandpaper. \n \n On the other side, Mr. Robbins nodded at his daughter and grabbed the creature \u2019 s large and scaly tail, and pulled. \n \n Their combined efforts made the dragon come unstuck with a great PLOP, like the sound of a cork escaping a bottle. The impact shook the dragon enough that he fell heavily on his bottom, huffing as it landed. He flapped his wings, but they did n't seem to do any good other than stirring up a lot of dust. \n \n Mr. Robbins fell backwards, scrambling out of the way. The dragon regained his balance, stood up, and promptly deposited a pile of manure on Mr. Robbin \u2019 s shoes. \n \n \u201c Ergh, \u201d Mr. Robbins said, staring at the steaming mess on his shoes. \n \n \u201c I apologize, \u201d the dragon said, \u201c Thank you for your help. \u201d \n \n Its voice was deep and sort of throaty. There was also an atonal two-tone quality about it that was grating on the ears. \n \n Mr. Robbins gave a cry, like a wounded animal, and turned pale. He stared up at the dragon in awe and then scrambled to his feet, wiping his dirty shoes on the grass. \n \n \u201c I woke up this morning, \u201d the dragon continued, \u201c We were asleep for a long time\u2026too long. And the caverns where we heaped together for safety were too crowded, so I tried a transportation spell back to my home. But it's been too long. How long? I do n't know. And\u2026 apparently, things have changed quite a bit, because my cave is gone. And your cave entrapped me with its iron claws. \u201d \n \n He pointed a single claw at the porch railings, and curled a lip. \n \n Mr. Robbins sidled towards the other entrance of the house. \n \n \u201c Nell -- get back in the house. I \u2019 m going to call Animal Control, \u201d Mr. Robbins stammered. He fled back across the yard, going through the door on the other side of the house. The door slammed behind him, reverberating the porch railings. Nell decided to ignore her father \u2019 s command, and stepped a little closer. She hadn \u2019 t put her shoes on yet, and the sidewalk felt rough and cool against her bare feet. \n \n The dragon turned around. It surveyed their small fenced in yard, and then strolled over to the garage. Nell's father had pulled the car out into the driveway to fill the tires earlier this morning.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] November , 1965 : Moscow has lost radio contact with a secret research facility in Siberia , and the last broadcast from the facility was `` It ... is awake . ''\n","story":"*Hey guys, just wanted to say this is my first post in this subreddit ( and on reddit for that matter ), anyway here is my story let me know what you think: \n \n In a secret bunker underneath the city of Moscow, the bitter smell of a cigar lingers in the air. The smoke from the cigar slowly dances around an incandescent bulb. A row of these old and discolored bulbs give off a warm yellow light in a plush and lightly furnished office. Six important men sit in a row, in cushioned theater style chairs. Another man sits behind a desk facing them with a microphone and radio resting in front of him on old oak desk. They all sit in silence waiting for the radio to begin receiving transmissions from the research facility in Siberia. \n \n Suddenly the radio comes to life and cuts the silence in the room with the crunching sound of static, startling a couple of the men. The tinny voice of a man comes in through the static, `` Come in Moscow, do you read?'' \n \n The man behind the desk sits upright and responds into the microphone, `` We read you loud and clear Siberia.'' \n \n `` Good,'' the man on the radio continues, `` good evening gentlemen, I just wanted to let you know that testing has had some complications, it seems our test subject is more resilient than we thought. It began showing signs of consciousness early this morning.'' \n \n One of the men from the room quickly sits up and nervously asks, `` It's not conscious now, is it?'' \n \n The man on the radio gives a smug laugh, `` Of course not, only a fool would allow such a thing. We immediately gave it a stronger sedative to induce a deeper sleep.'' \n \n `` Is that the'complication' you were speaking of doctor?'' Another man from the room asks. \n \n `` Not quite,'' The man on the radio let out a quick sigh, `` the complication is we found that we ca n't get too close to the test subject at this time. The last two men who entered the room to interact with it died a mere six hours later. We're not quite sure on the cause of death, although we speculate it was due to radiation poisoning. Once the autopsy comes back we will confirm or deny this theory, and if it is true we should be able to proceed as long as we wear containment suits from now on.'' \n \n One of the men from the room put his cigar in the ashtray and leaned forward towards the radio, `` Doctor, are you positive there's anything to learn from this...'thing'. It seems to be more dangerous than it's worth, and there's no point to keep it around if there's no benefit.'' The rest of the men in the room began to mumble amongst themselves, either for or against the argument. \n \n `` Gentlemen please,'' the man on the radio began, `` you need to understand that we are dealing with something here that no one has ever encountered before. We have a rare opportunity here to take a glimpse into the future and learn things that nobody knows yet. Our test subject is an unbelievably vast well of untapped knowledge, technology we have never even fathomed is simple and archaic to what it knows. Imagine the spoils mother Russia could obtain from this knowledge. Unfortunately, we are learning as we go, but I assure you we have everything under control. The safety of our test subject and the safety of our staff here are my number one concerns. I assure you the test subject is as harmless as a small kitten in the current state that it is in, and we will do everyth-''. \n \n The man on the radio was interrupted by a faint voice on the radio in the background. No one in the room could quite make out what he was saying. The faint voice quit talking and the man on the radio came back on, `` Excuse me gentlemen, it seems a small occurence has commanded my attention. I will only be gone a minute, it's nothing to worry about.'' \n \n The men in the room silently sat around the radio as they worriedly glanced around at one another. They realized they had all leaned forward to try to hear the faint voice from earlier and they all slowly leaned back into their chairs. Everyone was too nervous to say anything, and none of them knew what to say anyway. The silence was thick and as it continued the tension built in the room, and everyone became more increasingly uncomfortable. Once again the crackling of static shattered the silence and all the men in the room turned their heads towards the radio. The sound of an alarm began to grow in volume over the radio accompanied with the sound of various men shouting in the background. \n \n The man behind the desk began shouting into the microphone, `` Hello, hello, Siberia, please come in, can anybody hear us? What is your current situation?'' \n \n There was no response. Only the continuation of the alarm as it slowly reverberated down the spines of everyone in the room. Suddenly, running footsteps were heard on the radio as the voice of the man from earlier screamed from the radio over the alarms, `` It seems I was horribly wrong gentlemen, we seriously miscalculated the will power of our test subject and he is awake and loose, Oh god what have we unleashed onto this worl-.'' The man on the radio was cut off as a huge explosion resonated through the radio, making the men in the room jump in their seats. The lights in the office flickered off and sent the room into complete darkness as the radio went dead silent. Everyone was too afraid to move or make a noise, they silently sat as still as possible in the eerily quite darkness. Slowly, the sound of rough, laborious breathing began to rise from the radio, the last breathes of a dying man. The man from earlier whispered through the radio `` It... is awake.'' A loud thud is heard, and then a sickening sound of something being torn apart and the smacking of lips. A gut-wrenching inhuman scream is heard over the radio as the sound burn-outs the transistors on the radio. The sound slowly echos through the room and disappears. \n \n The lights flicker back on, and there is nothing but sheer terror and regret on all of the faces of the men in the room. As the men sit in silence, certain of their doom, the smoke of the long forgotten cigar slowly rises from the ashtray to carelessly dance around the yellow incandescent lights once again.\n"}

The automated chime sounded. `` Please tell me your member ID?'' \n \n `` Fucking really? 48755421.'' I rattled off. You learned to memorize that. Getting lost in Space-Time travel was n't uncommon. It was always an inconvenience, and I had a busy work day. \n \n `` I'm... sorry, I could n't find that. Please repeat your number.'' I almost screamed. \n \n `` Agent.'' The voice requested it again. `` AGENT!'' I screamed. It echoed in the crisp desert air. Finally, they forwarded me to a human. \n \n `` I'll transfer you to an agent in our call center. Please be aware that due to unusual call volume, you may be placed on hold for a moment longer than usual. When we transfer your call, we may record it for future training.'' I paced in the desert for a few minutes. It was usually pretty easy to fix mis-jumps like this. I just had to calm down and be patient. \n \n `` Hello, Mr. Lee. My name is Guthrie in the Sirius system. How are you doing today?'' \n \n `` I'm okay.'' \n \n `` Glad to hear that. How can I help you?'' \n \n `` I got mixed up in a jump.'' \n \n `` Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Well, we'll help you out. I'm going to track your device right now. Just one minute.'' I heard him typing. `` How's the weather where you are?'' He tried to offer a human touch. I was not feeling it. \n \n `` Good. Dry. It's a desert.'' \n \n `` That makes sense. You are actually in Roswell, New Mexico.'' \n \n `` Oh! I guess I did n't win first place.'' He chuckled at my joke. \n \n `` Hmm.'' He said. `` You are actually in 1947, local time.'' \n \n `` You mean the year?'' \n \n `` Yeah! Weird, right? I've never seen someone go so far back.'' \n \n `` Is that a problem?'' \n \n `` Nah, we'll send an agent your way right now. He'll help you out. Just hold for a moment.'' \n \n I did.

It looked like a ship, and it was flying towards me. \n \n `` Oh shit.'' \n \n `` Is something wrong?'' \n \n `` I see your guy, but he is coming in *way* to fast. I do n't think he can stop.'' I waited, and he collided with the ground. The crash was loud and bright. If anyone was nearby, they heard it for sure. `` Holy shit! He crashed.'' \n \n `` Stay away from the wreckage! No one can see you from that time!'' I disconnected the comms unit, and I ran towards the ship. It was a mess. I cracked the door open, and it was hot to the touch. Inside, the warped body of the man to rescue me languishing in pain. His head was bulbous and large. His eyes were two black saucers, almond shaped. His body was frail and thin. He had a grey sheen all over him. I knew what it was instantly: warp body. He came in too fast out of warp, and his eyes would n't reduce size fast enough. He was driving blind when he crashed. \n \n `` Hughanenhgha'' He muttered to me. It was hard to hear over the people talking. This got really bad. \n \n `` What's that, boy?'' The main with the rifle pointed at my chest said. He saw my face and his teeth set on edge. I am sure he assumed I was Japanese. I looked at my suit. It was so black it was a void. I looked enough like military. I had an idea. \n \n `` This is federal property. This weather balloon crashed off course. We are reclaiming it now. Please, go about your way. You are trespassing on federal property.'' None moved, and they stared at me like cattle. \n \n `` He's right. Everyone clear out or we will be making arrests.'' A man in a black suit said to the crowd. His voice was like a slithering whisper. It was unsettling. \n As they backed off, confused, he leaned to me. `` Impersonating a federal agent is a lot of jail time, Mr. Lee. We need to talk.'' My blood became glaciers. `` I liked the weather balloon angle though.'' He smirked at me. \n \n I knew I was fucked.\n"}

Soon enough, the snow flurried in, and with it, Imperial soldiers. The cracking of guns echoed across the train, and men died, screaming, on both sides. \n Suddenly, Ratimir bounded off, and in the direction of the battle, no less. Lev chased after. Little did he know that Ratimir had turned into a side chamber, and a man with wild hair was tying a roll of paper around the dog \u2019 s massive neck. \n Lev wandered the train despondently as bullets whizzed through the air. Suddenly, Ratimir sprang at him from around a corner. The huge dog barked triumphantly, then dashed back the way he came, leaving Lev to chase after.

One such creature stood... well, really laid before him. It caught his eye that the orange reptilian's body had stopped oozing a dark liquid. Bang. The `` corpse'' gave a yelp as the.50 Action Express sent a chunk of its head flying. It was incredible what a Desert Eagle could do to flesh. \n `` Play dead all you want... nothing's gon na stop the can of whoopass.'' \n Having made his point, he moved on, taking special care to step on the dead alien's corpse. With a little aid from his steel tipped boots, the strip club's barred door smashed open. Alien apocalypse or not, there was always time for the ladies.

His eye crept open barely enough to let some light in, letting his fingers find their mark and cutting off the DJs shrilling tones. Five more minutes\u2026 \n \n The sound of a vacuum in the hall sent Andrew up with a jolt. `` Shit'', he stammered as he looked at his phone, `` Eleven thirty four!'' One foot caught the edge of the sheets, trapping his ankle in it's hungry jaws and Andrew found himself on the ground with the room spinning. Kicking back and twisting away his legs were freed as he stepped to his feet. \n \n Jeans sat on the back of his chair, keys and wallet still inside the pockets. Ripping open the curtains Andrew squinted for a moment to adjust to the new found brightness. Dust and cat fur streamed lazily in the streaks of light, dancing stars floating throughout the room. \n \n `` Goddamn I hate New Years.''

I ca n't cover for you, they're gon na notice.'' \n He knew she was right but what other option did he have? `` Just say I'm around, Ally you're the best!'' The phone was off and he was bounding the stairs in twos. Eight flights down is better than right flights up, but that did n't stop him from losing his breath. At the bottom of the stairs he slowed and took breath before stepping into the lobby. \n Immediately he remembered why he hated this night so much. The lobby of the Miami Crown Regal Hotel was packed. Not even noon and the drunks were taking over already. The doors to the outside world were twenty feet away but might as well have been fifty. \n'' Are there any side exits?'' \n `` Ok Andrew, there is a second exit on the north wall.'' \n He looked behind a pillar and saw the glowing EXIT sign which he quickly stepped towards. \n Outside the traffic had already started to back up. Taking a car would be pointless and Andrew quickened his pace as he glanced at the time. The minutes were ticking away too fast. Ally might be ready to hit him by the time he got there. \n `` What's the fastest way to walk to my 1130 appointment?'' \n `` Ok Andrew, checking the map. Here is your fastest route.'' And Andrew was off, hoping he still had a job when this was all over. \n \n Ally always stood out in a crowd. Especially when surrounded by tech nerds. Tall thin and gorgeous, when you met her you knew she belonged on TV. She stared through him but pretended not to notice. He grabbed the camera from the back of the news truck and framed a shot on Ally. \n `` OK let's get some B-roll.'' She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, opening them as she looked up into the lens. `` I'm Ally Hernandez from Tech Online News, and we're\u2026'' But she cut herself short as the lights dimmed down. \n Andrew reframed the shot onto the stage, just as the man walked out to give the presentation. \n \n A brisk pace brought the man to center stage and the lights dimmed. The crowd noise simmered and silence filled the room as the man surveyed the room. \n `` Today I bring to you something extraordinary. I wo n't bore you for you long.'' He reached into his pocket and pulled out the device he was here to show, `` This new iPhone is faster, thinner better battery, all the things you expect to be.

Cars sat stationary in every lane for as far as the eye could see, and I was already an hour late for work due to a malfunctioning wake-up alarm system. I frantically barked a command at Navigator,'NAVIGATOR REROUTE. REROUTE. ABORT CURRENT ROUTE'. An artificial woman's voice seeped curtly through the front speakers,'I am sorry, I can not re-route from this point.' I slammed my fists against the dash, muttering an expletive under my breathe and leaning back into my chair, accepting my fate in a sulk.'I ca n't believe this shit' I hissed through gritted teeth. My car had pulled to a dead stop in the left lane, and I looked across to a man in the car next to me, who seemed to be angrily shouting at his Navigator. I could see him slamming his dash, and when I caught his eye he just kind of shrugged and shook his head in tired exasperation. Sitting back in my chair I let out a big sigh and pulled my iphone 53-slim lite from my pocket.'Read mail' I said, and listened as my phone rattled off spam emails regarding performance enhancing drugs and new models of'adult' androids.'Read News' I interrupted, and the pretty news lady with the short black hair from North West Today appeared in front of me, projected on to the front window of my car. \n \n'... the mysterious Object that has been hovering above the Nevada desert for two and a half years now.'

America and the'Object' had held the attention of the World Community ever since the day It had appeared mysteriously.

The news lady continued. \n \n'As you all know, the Object appeared sometime around June of 2061, and despite our best efforts we have never since been able to determine its purpose or origin. Spanning a massive 20 mile area, the spherical object has hovered 100 feet above the desert for over two years now. Despite the rigorous analysis of the World Community's top scientists and intellects the Object has remained a complete mystery. Until today.' I looked across to the man in the car beside me who had been shouting at his Navigator earlier, and it appeared that he, too, had decided to turn on the news; I could see the news lady projected on his cars front screen, his face hanging agape in an expression probably not very different from my own. I turned my own attention back to my screen, where the news lady continued, \n \n'The Object, which up until now has shown no sign of life or movement, today began to open.' The picture changed from the news lady to an image of the Object, which then slowly began to peel open quite like the sections of an orange might open, with each section peeling out from the middle. Suddenly from the middle of the newly opened Object a great explosion of light, like from some kind of quazar, erupted out toward the sky in a continuous and violent beam.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A man with above average intelligence wishes for the world to be smarter . He is delighted to find that his wish has come true , until he realizes that he is now the least intelligent man in the world .\n","story":"Theory and Practice \n \n Dr. Christianson was the most distinguished panelist at the debate. He'd spent his entire professional career ( adult life ) studying the psychology of the human mind from an evolutionary perspective. He held a PhD from Harvard, and was a highly paid consultant for the Advertising Industry. He used his above average intelligence to persuade the average Mark to buy things ( whether the Mark needed them or not ). \n \n After 40 years of manipulating the masses, he woke up one morning with pangs of guilt. To ease his guilt, he convinced himself that the problem was not him or his work ( the 2nd best psychologist was always waiting in the wings, ready to take his place - and the money that came with it ). No, the problem was not him ( he told himself ), but rather the masses themselves. They were simply too stupid ( on average ). He convinced himself that if only the masses ( the rest of the world ) became smarter, they would posses the ability to be aware of his manipulations and thus make them mute and ineffective. \n \n Those fearful ads intended to persuade the average Mark to perform some action ( to vote - or not vote - for certain political campaigns, to ask their doctor for specific prescription pharmaceutical drugs, to buy that car that would make them feel love, to buy that dress that would make them feel loved, etc ) would surely not work on the masses if they were only smarter. \n \n So, for an entire year, every morning and every evening, he prayed for the masses. He prayed that they would become smarter and cease to fall for his psychological manipulations. Of course, being an intellectual, he did not believe in the power of prayer. But, being an intellectual, he understood it's evolutionary roots. Thus, he understood why his prayers would ease his guilt. In a way, he was manipulating himself. \n \n After a year of prayer, he woke one morning to find out that his prayers were answered. It was the morning of Thanksgiving day, and his children and grandchildren were visiting. While sitting around the TV, watching the Cowboys game, one of his most recent commercials came on the air. It was intended to get young children to nag their parents to buy them an implant for the latest 8-G droid chip. It was a well crafted commercial, playing on the fears of the out-group and the love of the in-group. Words ca n't do it justice. \n \n However, the words of Dr. Christianson's youngest grandchild were the answers to his prayers. Little Jerry, just four years old at the time, simply turned to his grandfather and asked, `` Who made you do that?''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You live in Gemini , one of the 12 flying cities , beneath you are the ruins of the old world . One day your ICARUS system fails as you travel to Cancer and you fall to the world below .\n","story":"I was flying over to Cancer when it happened. My systems were working perfectly well, and then, just a minute later, they failed. I do n't know why my systems failed, just that they did. I was scared. I knew that I would be crash landing on the surface. Nobody has ever been to the surface in years. Now, everyone lives in one of the twelve flying cities. There is old world mythology about people living in underground structures after the Great Destruction, but very few people believe that. My systems failed, and I fell. I landed on the surface, and I was surprised by what I saw. I had heard tales of great monsters on the surface, but they had not prepared me for what I saw. These beasts looked like our dogs and cats, but much bigger and meaner. There were other monsters that looked completely different. When I crash landed on to the surface, I did not know what to do about these beasts. They were coming for my car, and I was scared. Then, I saw an arrow hit one of them, and they ran away. \n \n The arrow was shot by a human being who must have already crash landed on the surface. He looked strange, like he had been living on the surface for a long time. He had a bow. I have no idea how he knew to bring a bow with him when he crash landed on the surface. I had nothing to defend myself with because I did not know that I would be crash landing onto the surface. I got out of my car to talk to him. \n \n I said, `` Hello, stranger. I am from Gemini.'' At this, he nocked an arrow in his bow and pointed it at me. `` I come in peace,'' I said. \n \n He said, `` Are you an alien or something? What do you mean,'I come from Gemini'?'' \n \n I said, `` I'm from Gemini, the flying city. What flying city do you come from? And by the way, what is your name?'' \n \n `` Flying city? What are you talking about? My name's Elijah. I never heard of no flying city.'' \n \n `` What do you mean, Elijah? You've never heard of the flying cities? The twelve flying cities. You're from one of them, right? Sagittarius? Maybe Capricorn? How did you get down to the surface? Did your car's systems fail too?'' \n \n `` What are you talking about, how did I get down the surface? I've always lived on the surface.'' At this point, I realized that he was a surface dweller, a descendant of one of the people who must have chosen to live in caves rather than relocate to one of the flying cities. I had heard of these people before, but I never believed that they actually existed. I mean, who would n't want to live in a flying city? We had flying cities, flying cars, flying ships. It was awesome. It was strange, learning that there were still people who chose to live underground. But here was Elijah, living on the surface. I thought about how to explain to him about the flying cities. \n \n I said, `` Your ancestors chose to live underground, in caves, when this world was destroyed. My ancestors chose to live in flying cities, instead. There are twelve flying cities, and each one has its own Mayor. There is a central government based in Pisces, that controls the money and has the federal executives and representatives. There is one representative from each city. The representatives are separate from the mayors.'' \n \n `` What about the Queen?'' \n \n `` There is n't a queen. We have a democracy. Do you have a queen?'' \n \n `` I've heard stories of the Queen. She was in charge of the operations of the world, I think, before it was destroyed.'' Elijah was talking about the Queen of the World, who was the symbolic head of the world before it was destroyed. The Queen was on all of the old world money. The Queen was clearly not really in charge of the operations of the old world, she just was a symbol. There was, however, a plot to overthrow her. It was unsuccessful, but it was part of what led up to the Destruction of the old world. \n \n Then Elijah took me to meet his family. He introduced me to his wife, Matilda, and their children, Daniel and Hannah. He told them that I had the most amazing tale of flying cities. They asked me questions about them. I answered most of their questions. Then Daniel asked, `` Do they have a President in these flying cities?'' \n \n `` Yes,'' I said. \n \n `` Then, do they have a queen? Because if they have a president, then they should also have a queen? Who is the queen of the flying cities?'' \n \n `` There's not a queen. It's a democracy.'' \n\n"}

There, walking in the door, was a man and his son. However, the son was in a wheelchair and did not have arms or legs, and not much of a torso, either. Joe blinked to make sure he was seeing things correctly. The man sat his son on a stool at the bar, then took a seat next to him. \n \n `` Two beers please.''

His son chugged this beer faster than Joe has seen anyone knock back any before. Even before Joe could be astonished at that feat, something amazing happened. From nowhere, an arm popped out of the son's small torso. Joe gasped. \n \n `` Oh, my -- Barkeep, another beer!'' The dad exclaimed. Joe quickly obliged, slamming another beer on the bar top. The son grabbed this beer and drank it down. *POOF*, out popped another arm. `` ANOTHER!'' the dad yelled. Joe already had another beer in his hand and quickly handed it to the son. This one went down even faster than the others. *POOF*, out popped a leg. \n \n `` This is amazing.'' Joe said. \n \n `` How is this even possible?'' The dad was ecstatic, with tears gleaming in his eyes. `` Please, another beer!'' \n \n Joe dropped another beer on the bar, and watched in anticipation as the son slammed it back.

His knuckles hurt from the incessant rapping he'd kept up these past few hours. Hours? Yes, it must be hours by now. What light there had been coming in around the locker door and through the slits at his eye level had faded now, and it was dark. He was hungry, and, he really had to pee. \n \n \u201c I will not piss myself, \u201d he said, resting his head against the cool metal of the locker. My god he was uncomfortable. The pain in his back and neck had surpassed excruciating now and he'd ceased to feel his right leg, screwed up behind him. He rapped again on the door. \n \n \u201c Is anyone out there? Anyone? \u201d he called again, \u201c Please. I'm stuck, \u201d he said, \u201c I'm stuck in here. \u201d He felt tears prick his eyes again. God damn it not again. He thought he'd cried it all out already. Would he be in here all night? Hopeless, he let the sobs wreak his body. He slammed his fist into the door over and again saying, \n \u201c Why! Am! I! Such! A! Fuck! U -- ahhhhh! \u201d he fell forward as the locker door opened all of the sudden and he went sprawling. \n \n Breathing heavily and still wiping tears from his eyes he became aware of a figure standing over him, broom help aloft, prepared to strike. \n \n \u201c What manner of beast are you? \u201d the figure demanded. He was tall and stood lightly, as if accustomed to battle. For such an old man, he had a commanding presence, and Roger felt himself instantly forgetting the hopelessness of the last few hours. What manner of beast was he? He thought to himself still sprawled on the floor. It was important that he answer this question to the absolute best of his ability. \n \n \u201c I am a boy! \u201d he said finally, excited to have gotten to the root of it. He looked up again at the shadowed face of the old man. \n \n \u201c Stand. \u201d the figure said as he lowered the broom from over his head, and instead rested it in front of him, one hand gripping the top of the handle as if it were a staff. \n Roger began to stand immediately, and then fell again, finding that his right leg still was asleep \n \n \u201c What's wrong with you? \u201d the voice asked him. Roger, kneeling, massaged his right leg. \n \n \u201c I will stand sir, it's just that I ca n't feel my leg. \u201d He looked up into the face, not an unkindly face, \n \n Roger could see now, and the eyes were alight, he saw, a bright gold color that immediately left one with the impression of a cunning mind. Compassion replaced the concerned look, and the man closed his eyes quickly, said something low under his breath. Roger stopped trying to get up, and instead felt a warmth emanating up his leg and into his stomach and chest. He felt at peace, and he found he could stand now, easily, and without the daggers in his leg, back or neck. \n \n \u201c Is that piss? \u201d the man said, pointing with his free hand. \n \n Roger looked down still in his peaceful stupor, to find that in fact he had pissed himself. Surprisingly, he found he did n't mind. \n \n \u201c Yes, \u201d he said cheerfully, looking back at the man. The man let out a sigh, \u201c Come with me, \u201d he said and led the way down the hall. \n Roger stepped out of his puddle of pee and merrily walked behind the man. \n \n \u201c I'll leave you to your own mind, shortly, my friend.... er, what is your name young man? \u201d \n \n \u201c Roger, \u201d Roger said happily. \n \n \u201c Roger, \u201d the man repeated politely, \u201c I feel that the'pleasant feelings' spell may still be needed for you, however, at least until we can find you a clean pair of pants. What do you think? \u201d \n \n \u201c I think that sounds lovely! \u201d Roger said. \n \n \u201c I thought you might. My fault, of course, should have remembered that the spell's relaxing affect can easily create bathroom mishaps! \u201d the man seemed vexed, \u201c but no matter. This is part of the reason retirement was a good idea, \u201d he said, conspiratorially to Roger, \u201c You are n't the first that's had the pleasant feelings spell result in an embarrassing scenario, either, mind you. No, no. And you just a boy. A very nasty evening resulted when the'pleasant feelings' spell was used on Master Irollio at a feast. The poor mistress dropped a jug of wine on his pants, and so we thought it prudent to help him enjoy himself by casting a little spell, harmless! We thought. Later, when we found him with the cook in the kitchen pantry, you would n't believe the shock! And him, over thirty five hundred! Pleasant feelings indeed! How old are you, pray tell? \u201d the man asked. He walked, broom in hand, like a wizened member of parliament, rather than a janitor, Roger pleasantly noted, based on his uniform and the embroidered name, \u201c Bob \u201d on the man's breast. \n \n \u201c I am 14, \u201d Roger said, \u201c 15 in December. \u201d \n \n \u201c 15 in December, my my, we may share a birthday! \u201d \n \n \u201c Wonderful! \u201d Roger said. \n \n \u201c But I'm a might older, as you may be able to tell, \u201d the man said again, his gold eyes twinkling, and winked at Roger. The man stopped. They were in front of the men's locker room. \n \n \u201c Now Roger, almost 15, if you go in there, you will find that there is a wonderful hot shower already going for you, with soap, and a fluffy white towel for you to dry off with. Then you will find that, amazingly, your clothes have been cleansed and lay for you dry and warm, and patched I daresay, \u201d he said, taking a look at Roger's ripped sleeve. \u201c All will be lovely, and when you come back out, we can discuss the proceedings which have brought you into the locker in which I found you. Off you go! \u201d he said, and he gestured with his hand towards the door. \n \n After his shower, where everything had been exactly as Bob had said, Roger dressed in his newly mended clothes ( was his sweater a different material? That's odd, he thought. ) He came back out of the locker room. The hallway was much colder than the locker room had been, and it smelt of bleach. He found the old man back by his locker, his? Not his, but the one he'd been in. He did n't want to lay claim to the locker, lest Blaine and his buddies thought to have him set up permanent residence there. The man had cleaned the floor where Roger had peed. Roger felt himself redden as he walked up behind the man as he mopped. \n \n \u201c I'm er, sorry about that, \u201d he said, \u201c I would have cleaned it up myself. \u201d \n \n The man did n't turn, but scoffed, and said, \u201c Och think nothing of it Roger, it was a cinch. Feeling better? \u201d \n \n \u201c I am. Look, thanks so much, I suppose I should be getting home before my Mom gets worried for me. \u201d \n \n \u201c Is she worried do you think? \u201d the man asked, still mopping. Roger was taken aback a bit. Roger's mother probably was n't home, and would n't be. She had n't been home in three days. He said nothing. \n \n \u201c Tell me, \u201d the man said turning now, and placing his hand atop the mop handle in the same manner as he had done to the broom, \u201c what exactly did you plan on eating tonight? Mm? Ramen noodles again? And where did that rip in your sleeve come from? I daresay, Blaine and his cronies are n't to blame, are they Roger? \u201d the man spoke softly, kindly, but Roger felt heat rise up his stomach in anger and disbelief. \n \n \u201c Look old man, I do n't know how you know that, but it's none of your damn business. \u201d \n \n \u201c It's not, you are right. I have given up meddling in things that are n't my business, to be honest. \u201d the man seemed contrite, embarrassed, yet he went on, \u201c It's only just that, well, I've just started this job, and I suppose I could use some help here. You know, it's a big school. And well, I've made a few concessions, to be sure. I mean, please, no amount of bleach would have that locker room smelling like anything but a pig sty for per-pubescent boys, gods save us, but I have made a serious commitment to doing things the, er, normal way where reasonable. So, perhaps, if you like, you could help me with my work? I'm not near as fast as I once was, and in return for your assistance, I will teach you a bit of what I know. What do you say to that? \u201d \n \n He looked expectantly at Roger with his yellow cat eyes. His face was long and angular. He had a well cared for mustache and a small pointed beard, straight as an arrow. His hair was long, it seemed, but was pulled back in a pony tail. Roger could see in his forearms the memory of strength. The man was tall and willowy, and graceful yet there was a curve to his spine that looked unnatural, and a bit of a limp when he walked. He would likely need help to finish cleaning the school, if Roger was being realistic. \n \n \u201c Roger, \u201d he said, \u201c I imagine you have other things to be doing with your time, but I have a feeling we might help each other. I learned long ago to see into a man's heart, and you, though a young man, have a strong, true heart, but you've had hardship. This is merely a helping hand to you, who I can see could use that which I am no longer willing to wield, to do good in the world, and to carry the torch, as it was passed to me. \u201d \n \n Roger hesitated. He had only just met this man, yet he trusted him. Bob had been kind to him, more so than anyone else in this blasted school. There was no reason to not help him that he could think of. He'd nowhere to be, and nothing to do after school... Certainly no one waiting for him. Yet this talk of the passing of the torch? He was confused. \n \n \u201c What torch is that? \u201d Roger asked hesitantly. \n \n The man smiled warmly, and held up his hand. \n \n \u201c This one, \u201d he said. In his hand, a bright blue flame appeared, and began to dance.\n"}

He looked exhausted. \n \n `` We are all level NINTEEN,'' continued the rogue, and the orc fighter sitting beside him nodded in agreement. `` and you wrote this donkey-dick campaign that we've been questing in for weeks only to have us be killed off? What the fuck happened to starting a religion? I thought we talked about that, Mark!'' \n \n The dungeon master tensely flipped through his binder of character sheets. `` I'm not Mark right now, I'm the leader of the cult you're trying to eliminate. If you forgot his name I can write it down on a Post-It note.'' \n \n `` We do n't have to die,'' offered the cleric, pushing up his glasses. `` I mean, he gave us a choice.'' \n \n `` Then what was the point of even doing this side quest? To loot the dungeon for some shitty gauntlets, Erica? \n \n The sorcerer looked down guiltily, tapping her pencil on the table. `` I thought they were really cool. +3 dex modifier.'' \n \n `` Yeah, okay. Whatever.'' The halfing stood up from the kitchen table, jostling the players' pieces again as he stomped to the fridge to grab another soda. He snapped open the lid with a sort of ferocity that only a man who had been in a dungeon for roughly a week could muster. `` You know what? Just fucking kill my guy, I do n't give a fuck. I'll write a whole new backstory and re-roll a paladin or some shit and then we can just move the fuck on from this.'' \n \n Mark rose as the offending rogue sat back down at the table, removing the paper divider between him and the rest of the table. `` You know what?'' He threw a d20 down with precision anger. `` Yeah, great! A natural 20. You decide you want to learn the truth and you fucking die, and you know what the truth is, Jake? You're a fucking asshole! Now no one else has to start over. Way to take one for the team.'' \n \n `` Fuck you,'' Jake scowled, taking a long drink. `` Okay fuck you, fuck everyone else, and fuck this campaign! I'm done!'' His chair was pushed out and he stood, slamming the soda down and spraying blots of Mountain Dew across the table. Angrily, he grabbed his bag of dice, a fistful of his tokens and miniatures and his coat. `` If you decide to cast a resurrection spell on me, do n't expect me to come back from the dead! You'd have to roll a nat 100 if you wanted me to ever come back to this dump!'' \n \n The front door slammed shut, and the rest of the party members blinked, still a bit numb from the whole siutation. After a pause, Ericka turned to Mark inquisitively. \n \n `` So... if we leave, I still keep the gauntlets, right?''\n"}

Today is your first ever day off .\n","story":"Death poked at the olives floating lazily in his martini, drifting slow circles through the drink. He imagined they felt much like he did right now, mostly useless, washed up and not doing much more than imagining what it might feel like to be an inanimate fruit, and with that full circle stream of thoughts he sighed and slumped lower in his barstool. His first day off and he'd ended up at a bar, a location with which he was very familiar ( the shadier ones were hotspots for souls needing to be reaped ), and he understood why they so frequently carried an atmosphere of heavy depression, hanging like a weight on their patrons' shoulders. Bars were depressing places for depressed people. \n \n \n He'd tried to call planet Xenor's reaper. Demise, her real name was, but a coworker told him that she insisted on being called Denise, which he thought was the most adorable thing he'd heard all decade. Unfortunately, their conversation had gone like this: \n \n `` Hey, Denise.'' \n \n *Muffled giggles. * `` Stop, stop it!'' *Shuffling noises. * `` Hello, who is this?'' \n \n `` It's Death.'' \n \n `` Oh, hey, Death. Hold on a sec...'' *More laughing. * `` Could you stop, I'm on the phone! Hey, Death, sorry. What's up?'' \n \n `` Um... are you busy today? It's my day off and I guess I was wondering if you wanted to...'' \n \n `` Death, I'm so sorry, I have to cut you off, I've got company and work is on the other line, I'm on call. I'll catch you later!'' \n \n `` Right, that's fine.'' But Denise had already hung up, and Death could've sworn he'd heard her shout, `` I'll be there in a sec, babe!'' before the line went dead. \n \n He'd wandered Earth's streets for a while after that, New York City, to be exact. Then he'd checked into a hotel and taken a nap. Now he was here. It felt like the epitome of a wasted day. Not that that surprised him; he was the reaper of souls, after all, a decidedly morbid job. It was fitting that even his days off would be lackluster at best, right? \n \n `` Right.'' Death confirmed to himself, and then glanced around nervously as he realized that he was talking to himself. He wanted to order another drink, but he could hardly afford groceries as it was. \n \n Just as he was about to throw in the towel ( literally, he had moved to toss down the cocktail napkin he'd been toying with ), a petite looking thing slipped into the seat next to him. She was thin and pretty with long, incredibly pale blonde hair, so pale it almost appeared to be a glowing white, and skin that was oddly radiant. \n \n `` I'll have whatever he just finished. And get him another!'' She turned her big brown eyes towards Death with a lopsided smile. He absentmindedly dropped the cocktail napkin to the floor. The woman's features were quirky and not traditionally beautiful, but something about her automatically made Death feel simultaneously soothed and nervous to be in her presence. He also felt incredibly out of place sitting next to her, so clearly out of her league. \n \n `` Uh. Hi. Do I know you?'' Death spoke in his usual deadpan voice. He was already figuring out excuses to decline the drink she'd ordered for him and book it out of there before he had to fabricate an identity to this human. She was strangely ethereal, though, and something kept him there. For just a minute longer, he told himself. He'd see what she wanted. \n \n `` Nope, but I know you. You're Death, right? Why are n't you reaping?'' \n \n Death startled upon hearing his own name, too shocked to ask her how the hell she knew who he was. Well, at least she was n't human, then, but he was n't aware that another unearthly being was scheduled to be on Earth at this time. An Angel out of place, perhaps? \n \n `` It's... it's my uh, day off.'' \n \n `` Oh, man, what did you do? Anything cool?'' She seemed so engaged, like nothing existed except for Death. Her eyes were full of more hope than Death had seen in ages. \n \n He decided to lie to impress her. \n \n `` Yeah, I hung out with a friend. A few friends. For a couple hours. They just left here, actually.'' He attempted a jovial smile. It probably looked more serial killer than anything else, which was fitting. It did n't phase the woman. \n \n `` That's definitely a believable story you told there. But I'm an optimist, I'll choose to believe you.'' Her laugh was like a thousand delicate wind chimes. Her demeanor was so open and pleasing, so warm, that Death managed to laugh with her, not even that embarrassed that she'd called him out, *almost* forgetting how cute she was. \n \n `` Well, thanks for the drink, uh... what did you say your name was?'' \n \n `` I did n't.'' The woman shifted her body towards him and extended a hand, smiling softly. `` It's my pleasure. They call me Afterwards.''\n"}

I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she did n't want to. \n \n The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: \n \n > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she could n't seem to form an argument.

There is a lot of this in this piece. You might be doing this in order to underline the weary sameness of what Hana is doing, which makes sense, but I think using it so frequently makes it difficult to engage with the story and distances the reader. \n \n You might try actually showing the dialogue at some points, e.g: \n \n *I'm the one who's armed*, Hana thought. *And you're demanding that* I *surrender? * She tried the say the words, but what came out instead, as she hefted her katana, was, `` Sorry.

He did n't know if it was the way the setting sun lit the house, the white tile turned gold, or the way it reminded him of the *siheyuan* in the fields where he met his in-laws for the first time, and it was up in the air who was more surprised; them at the *waiguoren* who landed in their laps or him at the sudden crowd that turned up to block the only escape.

Then back to the house, to watch the shadows crawl across the courtyard. \n \n *I seriously got nothing. * \n \n He sighed again, and closed the lid of his laptop. He had thought that this time, *this time* he'd find enough of a spark to light the dark and write again. Not tonight, it seemed.

A woman just coming out recoiled a bit and raised a questioning eyebrow; *Do I know you? * Still grinning, he shook his head and stood. *Then get out of here. Perv* her stance seemed to say. Stowing his laptop, he shouldered his bag, waved to the slightly offended woman, and started for home.\n"}

The TV shows a weary man in his sixties. `` As you may already know,'' he says, `` we have been withholding images from our Curiosity rover mission for some time. Some of you may believe that we have been doing it for years, but that's wrong. We have been doing it for sixteen days. But now we are sure that there is no mistake and that it's pointless to conceal our discovery.'' \n \n I sip the remains of the cold tea I had left on my table before going to bed early, wondering if I'm still dreaming. If it was real, I should already be hearing screams of joy of numerous conspiracy theorists, dancing and throwing their foil hats into the air. \n \n `` Sixteen days ago we found an artificial object on Mars. It is very unlikely to have been delivered by any unmanned mission we are aware about. There are no known landing sites in its vicinity.

Perhaps we will have to send another rover equipped specifically for this mission now that we know what to look for.'' \n \n `` Anyway, we have found an artifact, it took us sixteen days to get to it and inspect it.

We do n't know of any mission that was capable of delivering it. The Soviet rovers from missions Mars-2 and Mars-3 could n't carry it for sure, and Mars-4NM and Mars-5NM were canceled due to lack of a sufficiently powerful heavy carrier rocket.'' \n \n `` Curiosity is equipped with the ChemCam instrument, which allows to vaporise a cubic millimeter of matter with a laser burst and inspect its composition via spectrography. Unfortunately we ca n't examine the flag itself as it is too high, all that's available is the pole.'' \n \n `` And so we did it. We analyzed the pole.

I am beyond the edge of the known world, into the unknown. The hot, dry wind blows and howls against my clean-shaven face, and I look over the bare stones and stands of hardy, dwarfed pines clinging stubbornly to the steep cliffs. How long will it be until I am able to shave again, I wonder. I sit atop an old, clumsy mule, my faithful steed, with a small pack of supplies \u2013 a day \u2019 s rations, perhaps - of flatbread and salt pork, and a flagon of wine. As I ride, very slowly, down the embankment, gazing onto the bleak horizon, splashed gold and purple and red as the sun sinks in the distance, I begin to realize the enormity of my situation. My thoughts no longer dwell on how I will return and reclaim the throne that has been taken from me; instead, I begin to realize that I will be dead - food for vultures within two days - unless I find additional sustenance. Suddenly, I begin to laugh, bitterly, despite myself. I haven \u2019 t hunted since I was a boy.

These men, who have fought and bled and died for me during my long exile, would do anything to see me take the crown that belongs to me, and now is our time. I love them, and know them, like my sons and brothers. When I see myself in the mirror, I am no longer the fresh, young face that ran from my kingdom like a dog with a tail between my legs.

My face is lined with care from the nights spent beneath the stars and sleeping in the saddle, in the service of kings and princes, fighting their little wars. It has been hard, and I have lost much.

So, if any of you would be so kind to criticize this piece, I'd be really glad. ] ** \n \n -- -- -- -- - \n \n I stared at the screen in disbelief. \n \n The sun was shining through the small windows above my head and tinted the room in the orange morning light. I could hear the birds chirping right outside of it. It was a peaceful Wednesday morning, but I could n't fell any of this peace. Right now, I was horrified. \n \n My legs still shaking, I stood up from my computer and searched my way into the kitchen. My vision was blurry and I could n't tell walls from the floor any longer, when I suddenly collapsed, like the rug was pulled from underneath my feet. \n \n There I was, lying on the floor, still in shock because of what I saw, the vision of this horrible video playing again and again in my head, in full detail every time. His screams, his guts, his torn-off limbs... And amidst that massacre, an innocent stuffed animal, smiling like all the horror does n't happen around it, while its name-tag gets coated in blood. *Charlie*, the name I gave the little bunny that was John's present for our 1-year anniversary. It had gone missing the day the letter arrived, and now I knew why. \n \n The realization hit me out of nowhere. I just became a witness to the murder of the man I shared my life with for 3 years. He was... gone. Forever. \n \n Tears rolled down my numb cheeks like a small stream of water, and then the stream became a river and then the river became a waterfall. I could n't control myself, I was just there, on the ground, uncomfortable slumped over my knees, sobbing. I did n't want to do anything. In that moment, I only wanted to cry. \n \n In that moment, I only wanted to die. \n \n And so, I cried, alone, one the cold floor. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n I lost track of time, but when I managed to rise to my feet again, my tears had long dried out, and the light of sun had disappeared. Even the cars on the road outside were silent, almost as if the whole world decided to grieve with me. \n \n Once again, I tried to walk towards the kitchen door, this time with more success. As I opened the door, I expected the familiar smell of his favorite pancakes to fill my nose, I expected all my worries to be shaken off in an instant. \n \n The kitchen was empty. \n \n My eyes fell on the black letter on the kitchen counter. The letter I received three days ago. The letter that started this. The letter that took the love of my life away from me. \n \n I grabbed the letter in a hectic motion and stuffed it into the next-best pot I could find. After that, I took the pot, put it in the sink, and filled it with water until it was filled completely. Then, I violently put the water-filled pot on the stove, water splashing across the entire counter. I turned the stove on and set it on the highest setting. The next minutes, I spent looking at the letter inside the pot, as the water slowly began boiling just like I was. The letter dissolved more and more, until it was only a small, dirty lump. \n \n Without turning the stove off, I slammed the handle of the pot and sent it flying through the air. The water hit my left hand, but it did n't matter to me anymore. The tiny, black lump landed on the counter, right next to the sharpest knife in the whole kitchen. I took it into my hand, and rammed it into the former letter. Then I did it again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And... And again. And... again. \n \n I was panting heavily. The whole ordeal left me exhausted. I covered my face with my hands and leaned against the counter. The taste of blood in my mouth was an alien feeling to me that I barely noticed. I must have slipped with the knife a few times without noticing. \n \n After standing like this for a while, I decided to wash the blood off my face, so I entered the bathroom. It was small and white, quite perfect in a way. The two toothbrushes were standing at the sink, not knowing that one of them will never be used again. I took the pink one, threw it into the toilet and flushed it down. No one needed it anymore, anyway. \n \n My eyes fell on the mirror above the sink, and a stranger looked back at me. My hair was still black, my eyes still brown and my face still unshaven, but the me in the mirror was n't me. My hair lost it's shine, my eyes were tired and red from me crying, and my whole face was covered in blood. I turned the water on and began washing my face. I only then noticed the cuts and burns on my left hand, but I put it under the water anyway. \n \n The pain felt refreshing, in a way. I finally felt something again, after being numb for almost half a day. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n I was still dripping with water when I left the bathroom. There was no time to use a towel now. I had to do something. \n \n After making a coffee, I was sitting at my computer again. The video was still open, fixated on the smile of *Charlie*. I pressed Play again and began watching the video for the second time, this time, however, looking for clues. I examined every frame of torture, every shot of John's wounded body, but could barely find anything, until I noticed a peculiar moment. Whoever made this video, appeared to have known about John's ring and our engagement. It was displayed on a small pedestal in the background with a large white sheet setting it apart from the warehouse setting of the rest of the video. \n \n Whoever killed John, knew about him and me, and that were not a lot of people. I remember him saying that he told his sister and his brother, but would any of those two kill him? Gary was in another country right now, and Sarah is busy with the daycare. Neither would've had the time to do this. \n \n I pulled out my phone to see if his messages from yesterday had any clues in them. \n \n **sent Monday, 19:36** \n \n *sorry i culdnt mk it babe* \n \n *had 2 run erands for my boss* \n \n **sent Monday, 20:21** \n \n *btw i wont mk it 2 te aprtmnt 2night* \n \n *go 2 bed w\/o me k? * \n \n *i love u* \n \n *c ya* \n \n Yes, he disappeared during Monday night. And he appeared to had something to do that night, too. Did he meet up with a friend, a co-worker, or some gangsters? What did he do on Monday? Either way, I need to know who else he told about us. Or I'll never know who is responsible for this. \n \n Knowing that I would n't get any answers from staring at my phone like an idiot, I rose and walked towards the door. As I reached for the handle, my eyes fell on the picture on the table. It was the picture I took with John when we were skiing in the mountains. \n \n The picture stand was quickly opened, and I put the picture into my chest pocket. I wanted the good memories of John to be close to me, now that he was gone. \n \n I packed the handle of the door, opened it, and with a few swift steps, I left the apartment.\n"}

The knife felt oddly warm in his clenched hand as though it were a part of his body. \n \n The whispers continued, cutting through his thoughts. `` Kill the child. It's the right thing to do.'' \n \n It was three months ago when Phil started to hear them. He had started to see a shrink who said he had to have Schizophrenia. The plan was to give Phil Crass prescription pills that would make them stop. \n \n They never did. If anything, they became louder. 2:00 this morning, Phil was awoken with the voices saying something different. \n \n `` In the forest where she died.'' \n \n When he had come here, Phil did not really believe he would find anything. It was really just to get out of the house and keep his mind occupied. He had not been here since Mary died about a year ago. Both he and the doctor believed his girlfriend's death had caused these delusions. \n \n `` So what happens if I go looking for her?'' Phil asked himself, yet, he could not stop himself from going. \n \n When he arrived, there was some barely audible chanting in the distance, followed by a scream. The first thought was for Phil to drive to the screaming, but there were too many trees. He had to run. \n \n As he got closer, the chanting became louder as the screaming became quieter. Eventually, the lights of his car went out, leaving him in complete darkness. Why had n't he at least leave the door open?! \n \n Suddenly, he could see a small fire in the distance. Then, slowly, he could make out two people, a man and a woman, lying around it. They were all dead, with blood leaking out of their eyes, noses, and mouths. \n \n Then he heard it. \n \n There was the sound of someone giggling. Quiet at first, but quickly getting louder, Phil knew that it belonged to a child. Seeing a knife near one of the bodies, Phil picked it up and began marching toward the giggling. \n \n He could barely feel himself move, as though he was being controlled by something else. He allowed the giggling to guide him to where he needed to go. He suddenly tripped over something and felt a cool, ice cold liquid engulf his torso. He screamed as he ripped himself out of the lake and jumped out. \n \n Suddenly, the laughter stopped. \n \n `` This is where she died is n't it?'' Phil heard in a small girl's voice. \n \n `` Yes, it is.'' Phil said barely keeping himself from crying at the thought. \n \n `` How?'' \n \n `` She drowned.'' Phil told the creature. \n \n `` This is where I died too.'' He heard before a light suddenly lit the area. Phil had to cover his eyes for a second before they became adjusted and he could see where the light came from. \n \n He saw a girl at around the age of twelve with long black hair and piercing blue eyes. She had a fresh wound in her left cheek which bled profusely and dripped down her face onto the dead, yellow grass beneath her. \n \n There was a gaping hole in her chest, where Phil could see bone and he could hear a small pumping that he knew to be her heart beating. In her left hand, she held the flashlight she used to illuminate the area. \n \n `` I did n't drown.'' She said. \n \n `` How are you... back?'' Phil asked, keeping his eyes away from the girl's chest wound. \n \n `` My parents always did this sort of thing.'' The girl said before chuckling. `` You should have seen their faces.'' \n \n `` You killed them.'' \n \n `` They MURDERED ME! Left me in a lake with a knife sticking out.'' She pointed at Phil's hand, `` THAT KNIFE!'' She paused for a second, staring Phil. `` You wan na kill me too.'' \n \n `` Can you bring her back.'' Phil asked. The girl looked at him confused before sputtering, \n \n `` Yes, of course I can.'' But Phil knew she was lying. He charged at her. \n \n An hour later, Phil was driving back home.

There was a door marked Power, a heavy, iron thing with shiny brass hinges. There was a door marked Truth, plain and unadorned like I think truth ought to be. There was one that read Peace, and it looked like the white door to my grandmother's farmhouse. There was one for honor, a copper door that shone in the light of my flashlight. And there was fortune, a glittering gold door that made the copper of Honor pale in comparison. \n \n I had power. It lay in the rifle I'd discarded, in the knife and pistol strapped around my waist and in my own body. I had fortune, thanks to a generous grandfather who had passed away six months ago, two months after I'd been shipped out. I had truth, or at least a pretty solid understanding of how the world worked. I had honor. God, I hoped I had honor. \n \n But what I did n't have, and what the world did n't have, was peace. On my third tour here, to this land of sandstorms and a thousand years of warfare, the steady popping of the mortars was only noticeable when the militants stopped to re-load and the background noise stopped. Every day I'd watched a stream of refugees trod along a winding road with laden pick-up trucks choking on the dust and donkey carts packed to the brim with the most precious things they could carry. Behind them lay the smoking ruins of a village their ancestors had been driven out of ten times before throughout history and before them was just a U.N. camp without nearly enough resources to accommodate them all. It wore a body down to pick through one of those burned-out villages and see the corpses laid out in a line. I'd watched a good buddy take a bullet to the back and he's never going to walk again. And it kept going. Day after day of gunfire and the dead, of maneuvers and orders and rockets and bombs with no end in sight. \n \n So you bet your ass I walked through that peace door. \n \n Things looked different on the other side. There was just the one door, instead of the five, and the entrance that had been blocked on the other side of the door lay wide open and clear on this side. \n \n Outside, it looked the same as the landscape I'd just left, except the village in the distance was standing. I squinted. Scratch that \u2013 it was standing and it was bustling. Even from here I could see people moving in and out of its walls. Their voices carried over the sand and I was startled to realize the reason I could hear them so clearly was because there was no mortar fire covering it up. \n \n Up close, the buildings were taller. The streets were wider. I nearly got run over by a car \u2013 a nice car, not a beat-up pick-up but a silver sedan \u2013 when I stopped in the street to look at the Muslim Mosque and the Jewish temple side by side. Down the street I could see the spire of a Christian church. \n I walked around dazedly, feeling drunk. There were no raised voices, just smiles everywhere. I watched humanity press together, but there were no thrown elbows, no high-pitched protests one someone bumped into another. The walls were smooth. Not a bullet-hole or a shell pockmark to be found. \n \n \u201c Are you lost? \u201d someone asked behind me, speaking \u2013 it sounded like Arabic, but there was a strange accent to it \u2013 almost a Yiddish undercurrent. I turned around. There was a woman standing there, smiling beneath her hijab. Her smile widened when she saw my pale skin. \n \n \u201c American? \u201d she asked. I nodded. \n \n \u201c Five doors? \u201d \n \n I nodded again, feeling overwhelmed. She stepped forward to take my hand. \n \n \u201c You have questions, \u201d she said in stilted English. \u201c We will talk. \u201d \n \n I followed her to a sidewalk cafe and we had tea together. Her name was Farah and she'd gone through the door herself five years ago after her husband had been executed by extremists. \n \n Peace sounded \u2013 amazing, when she told me about it. No conflicts, no skirmishes. No World Wars. No atom bombs. No thousands of years of conflict in the Middle East. No murderous gangs in Central America, no conquering by conquest of Africa or South America. No slave trade. Apparently the American West was still predominately populated by Native Americans. \n \n And because of that, there was trade. Cultures grew and flourished. Greek, Chinese, and Arabic were \n the dominant languages, though each of those had mingled with other languages through trade and intermarriage. That explained Farah's accent. \n \n There were discoveries through science, though there was a lot I was used to seeing in my world that had never been thought of here. War drives innovation, after all. But joint-space exploration and worldwide collaboration had more than made up for it in other areas. \n There were still disagreements between people \u2013 there were still hurt feelings and arguments \u2013 but very rarely did they rise above a raised voice. \n \n \u201c Why? \u201d I asked, my voice cracking just a bit. \u201c What convinces people to react like that? \u201d \n \n Farah shrugged. \u201c They realized there was n't a need, I think, \u201d she said. \n \n I asked about religious conflicts. She showed me a Bible and a Koran. Every mention of war was gone. In Genesis, Cain killed Abel. God saw that there was wickedness in the hearts of men and so He strove to teach them a peaceful path so that the Cains of the world would learn to stay their hands and not harm the Abels. No story of Noah, no flood. No Samson and the Philistines. No Joshua and Jericho. \n \n It was hard to adjust. Farah helped. Waking up next to her every day helped. It had taken her awhile to get used to things here too, but she was so much happier than she'd ever been back in our world, where she worried every day that some harm would befall her family until the day that it did. \n \n The weeks turned to months, and still I could n't believe it. It was all just too \u2013 perfect. Every dystopian movie and novel I'd ever read or seen floated through my head each night. The Giver. Brave New World. 1984. Serenity. Even those stupid Divergent books my niece used to read. \n \n And I remembered the lesson from each. Human beings are incapable of peace unless the thing that makes them human is removed. Peace does not come without a cost that is greater than the reward of peace. \n \n So I purified my water as it flowed from the tap. I would eat only foods that I or Farah grew in her rooftop garden. I switched the soils out too, just in case there was something in those. I could n't guard against the air, though. I do n't know if they put anything in that. Farah humored me, even though I could tell my paranoia worried and irritated her. I could n't help the feeling, though. Something was wrong about the place. It was fundamentally off and I could n't even say why. \n \n A year to the day I had stepped through the door, I went back to the cave where I had emerged. Farah did n't want me to go but she did n't stop me. She had sadly said goodbye and watched me walk out the door in the direction I'd come. \n \n \u201c You can never come back, if you go through, \u201d she warned me quietly. \u201c We're only allowed once chance at peace. \u201d \n \n \u201c Come with me, \u201d I begged. \u201c There's something wrong about this place. \u201d \n \n She raised an eyebrow at me. \u201c There's something wrong about the place where we came from, \u201d she countered. \u201c My husband should never have died at the hands of another because he believed something different than they did. \u201d \n \n And so I left alone. I went back to the cave and back into the room. I did n't even hesitate when I walked back through the door. \n \n The room on the other side was the same, but the Peace door had disappeared. I did n't expect it, but I felt a sense of loss when I'd looked at the place where it had been. I was n't in love with Farah, but her presence had been a comfort to me, and I'd been the same to her. \n \n This time, I opened the Truth Door. I wanted it, simple and unadorned. \n \n It opened into a quiet bar. I'd been expecting another cave, but this looked like a bar in London or New York, some place I'd go with my buddies after a long day and we were tired of army bullshit and we just wanted to talk. \n \n \u201c Come on in, \u201d the bartender said. \u201c You ai n't the first person to walk through that door and you wo n't be the last. \u201d \n \n I shuffled in, taking in the neon sign in the window and the dark night beyond the pub doors. \n \n \u201c Is this where I find truth? \u201d I asked quietly. \n \n The bartender shrugged and put a glass down in front of me. \u201c Truth is subjective, \u201d he said. \u201c That's your first truth right there. But we get as objective as we can. \u201d \n \n \u201c Tell me about the Peace door, \u201d I said. \u201c What was the secret? They had to be putting something in the water or the air, right? Something in the soil? Soylent Green is people? What were they doing? \u201d \n \n The bartender looked surprised, and then he turned around to grab a bottle of bourbon \u2013 the real good stuff. He turned back and poured me way more than the two fingers you're supposed to. \n \n \u201c Son, \u201d he said finally, \u201c you walk through that door and you waste questions on a question like that? \u201d \n \n \u201c Tell me, \u201d I insisted. \u201c Something about it was n't right. \u201d \n \n The bartender poured himself a glass and nodded at mine. \u201c Drink up, son, \u201d he said. \u201c They did n't do a goddamn thing to make people peaceful, except decide that everyone would be happier if they did n't fight. The only thing wrong about peace is in your own goddamn head because you do n't think people are capable of it. Drink up, idiot. You just left the only peace you'll ever find behind. \u201d\n"}

That's when I heard the whispers.. \n \n `` She rises from her bed and surveys her surroundings, sisters are a territorial creature, I think now might be the best time to make our exit.'' I heard a familiar clapping sound and realized what he'd taken. My video camera. The little rat was recording me! \n \n `` RYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAN! YOU'RE SO DEAD!'' I leaped out of my bed towards the door, and pulled it open to see him running around the corner towards the stairs.

He thought it was funny! \n \n `` GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT!'' I stomped down the stairs following after the sound of his screams as if he was being chased by a fair haired rhino.

We better get out of here quick! The door dad!'' \n \n As I ran through the garage I saw dad pressing the garage door key as Ryan ran towards the opposite end of the room. Both of his hands holding onto the fedora which plopped up and down with every step his stubby little legs took him. I ran after him, trying to grab the camera from him. For some reason there was a massive safety mat that mum used for yoga laid out under the garage door which was halfway to closing.. \n \n Ryan turned to look at me with a cheeky smile before he gave me a wink, slid on the safety mat and under the closing garage door. He looked back at me, threw the fedora at my face and then laughed as the door got stuck on the safety mat. \n \n `` RYAN! GIVE ME BACK MY CAMERA!'' I screamed, wondering why neither mum nor dad did anything to help me. I turned around remembering dad closed the door for him. \n \n Dad smiled cheerily at me, as I stomped up to him glaring he pulled out the camera from behind his back and pointed towards the screen.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're from Earth ? What 's it like ?\n","story":"`` Bigger than you'd believe.'' Rebecca hoped that would be hint enough to get the group of teenagers to leave her alone. To her complete lack of surprise, it was not. \n \n `` Is it true that on Earth everybody owns a Leopard?'' \n \n `` No, not everyone on Earth owns a sports car.'' Rebecca reached into a pocket for a cigarette. \n \n `` I heard that there's dogs roaming the street levels and eating homeless people!'' \n \n `` No, the homeless *feed* their goddamn dogs, and not on each other.'' She put the cigarette into her mouth and pulled her lighter to her face. Where the fuck was Jacob and why had he abandoned her to these tiny monsters? \n \n `` Do all Earthlings drink vodka?'' \n \n `` No, that shit's awful,'' Becca sighed. \n \n `` Do n't you all eat *fish eggs*?'' \n \n `` It's caviar, and it's fucking expensive.'' Also she hated it. \n \n `` I heard there are n't any trees!'' \n \n `` None outside the pots, anyway.'' That shut them up for a moment. She could see them pondering a world without free-range flora and fauna. Welcoming the moment of silence, she spent it blowing a smoke cloud into the air. \n \n `` That sounds lame,'' a girl decided at last. \n \n `` Extremely,'' Rebecca replied, hope filling her chest. \n \n One of the teenagers, silent to this point, finally raised his voice. `` You're just saying that to get rid of us. Do n't blame you though. Pretty dumb questions.'' \n \n Becca rolled her cigarette between her teeth. `` For the most part, yes.'' The kids were somewhere between disappointed and offended, but they stayed quiet, which made Becca happy. \n \n `` We're just bothering you'cuz we do n't see Earth folk or UNASA officers out this far all that often.'' \n \n `` *Retired* UNASA officer,'' Becca corrected. `` Note the lack of rank on my sleeve.'' \n \n `` Well, I learned something,'' the boy observed, smiling. `` I'm satisfied. C'mon, guys, let's leave her alone.'' The group started to turn towards their little town, obviously headed home. \n \n `` Well...'' Becca hemmed and hawed for a moment, before making up her mind. Jacob had apparently gotten lost anyway. `` How'bout I just tell you kids from the top? That way you get a clear picture.'' The teens stopped, looked back at her, and then almost in unison sat on the grass. Becca took a deep breath, wondering exactly what she had signed herself up for. \n \n Jacob did not expect, returning thirty minutes later, to find his sister talking - lecturing? - a group of local kids. She was obviously pretty enthusiastic about it; she even occasionally unfolded her arms to talk with her hands. He was loath to break it up, but they were on a time table and Jacob had lost a lot of it arguing prices, so he had to get her away. `` C'mon, Becca,'' he shouted, `` we've got ta go.'' \n \n `` Ah, shit,'' Becca replied reflexively. `` Well, fuck, guys, I guess I got ta run. Uh. You have a good idea, anyway. Do some research if you care. Hell, get a job there, it's good fuckin' work for the most part.'' She stood and pivoted on a heel. `` Sorry to run so damn fast, but uh, I got shit to do, so - have a good day, nice meetin' you!'' They all responded in kind; she did n't have time to parse any of it, and she set off at a sprint to catch up to Jacob. \n \n `` I did n't know you were so good with kids, Becca,'' he told her, grinning as she pulled up beside him. She instantly began to glare. `` Hey, you were doin' great! I'm proud of you! Coming out of your shell!'' He reached over and patted her on the shoulder, grinning like an idiot. \n \n `` Shut up,'' she replied, struggling to find a way to sound cool about it. `` It was just a way to pass the fuckin' time you were off doin' whatever the fuck you think you were doin'.'' \n \n `` Coming out of your shell!'' he repeated, smiling broadly. She tried to punch him; he dodged and set off at a sprint, prompting her to chase at the same pace. \n \n Back on the hill, the kids watched. They watched the two earthlings chase each other all the way to their ship, and straight up the ramp. Finally, the quiet boy came to their final verdict about the whole thing. `` Man, Earthlings are weird.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] There was an angel caught in the power lines .\n","story":"It was my first day on the job, and the first time I ever smelled burning angel wings. I was shadowing Mike Fenwick, an old hand at wildlife and pest control and one of the best in the business. After twenty years working municipal, he'd gone independent with his own company, Fenwick Animal Control, and soon scored a corporate contract to supply animal control services to General Electric. His job was to patrol their southern Illinois facilities looking for evidence of vermin and pests, respond to calls regarding nuisance animals, set traps and remove captured animals, that sort of thing. Business was good, and he'd taken on several technicians to help him manage an expanding workload. I was the latest. \n \n I was fresh out of a Wildlife Biology degree, and expecting to spend my days wrangling possums, raccoons, mice and the like. The one thing I had n't expected to be wrangling was angels, but we got the call at 11:20am, an angel trapped in the power-lines south of Pittsburg, and Mike set me straight on the way over there. \n \n `` Most sixty percent of our work right now is angels,'' he told me. `` Clients like to keep it on the down low, so you do n't hear about it so much. Not good PR to have pictures of an angel getting cooked in your UHV line on the the six o'clock news, or smeared on the grille of one of your fleet trucks. But it's a real problem, for them anyway. For us it's gravy.'' \n \n `` But where do they come from?'' \n \n `` There's a big nest down Shawnee way, somewhere in the national forest they reckon but they have n't figured out where. Sometimes you get whole flocks of them coming out at once. Quite a sight if you get to see it.'' \n \n `` Yeah, but where do they *come* from,'' I said. `` Do you know? Everyone tells a different story.'' \n \n `` Well,'' Mike said, `` All I can say is I know a story too. Ca n't say it's for true for sure, but I've discussed the matter with some important folks over the years, and they've said the same thing.'' \n \n `` What's the story?'' \n \n `` Well, just a moment, we're here.'' \n \n Here was a spot a indistinguishable from any other in the endless, flat landscape of cornfields through which we'd driven. Only Mike's GPS could tell us we were in the right spot. The power-lines were a ways off from the highway, so we'd have to walk a bit. \n \n `` I hope it did't get stuck up there,'' said Mike, `` I do n't fancy doing live-line work.'' He grabbed a large bag of gear from the back of the truck, which he then handed to me, and we started walking. \n \n `` The story I heard,'' I said, after a minute or two, `` is that it was some evangelical pastor, who was also a genetics genius. Thought he'd create his own army of angels to help bring God's kingdom to Earth.'' Mike just let out a chuckle at that. `` Kid, I met a few pastors in my time, and not one of them was a genius in any sort of science. No, that story's mostly horseshit, I'm afraid. There's a grain of truth to it, but just a grain.'' \n \n By then we'd reached the base of the transmission tower. Scattered around there was a welter of white feathers, but no sign of the angel itself. Looking up, we could just about make out the shape of something, lodged into the tower's girders. \n `` God damn it,'' said Mike, `` Do n't suppose you've got any experience climbing these things?'' \n \n `` None.'' \n \n `` Well, we'll have to do something about that, but not today. Guess I'm going up there.'' He started rooting around in the pack for various pieces of protective equipment, and donning them. \n \n `` Angels are genetic splices, that much is right,'' he said, as he was getting prepared. `` But it was n't some crazy pastor or lone genius, it was Apple.'' \n \n `` Apple?'' I said. `` The computer company?'' \n \n `` That's right.'' \n \n Without explaining further he clipped a hot stick to his back and began climbing. I watched him for a while, then began sweeping up some of the stray feathers into a duffel bag. After five minutes, I looked up again to see he'd reached the object trapped in the tower. I could just about make out him poking and shoving it with the hot stick. Suddenly, something dislodged from the tower and fell. For a moment, my heart was in my mouth, thinking it was Mike. But it was n't. \n \n Eighty pounds of charred and smouldering angel carcass crashed to the floor beside me in an explosion of dust, blood and feathers. I let out an involuntary cry and leapt backwards. From up above, I could hear Mike laughing. Once I got my nerve back, I approached the thing. I'd never seen an angel this close before, dead or alive. Besides the stench of the burnt wings and flesh, what I noticed was how *weird* it looked. From a distance, angels looked the part, with smooth pink flesh, white-clad bodies, and great feathered wings. Up close, you could see how freakish they were. Like a strange cross between humans, birds and pigs, with big wide eyes and strange puckered mouths half way between beaks and lips. \n \n Mike got down quicker than he'd gone up. `` What are you gawking at,'' he said when he saw me examining the angel. `` Get it bagged up.'' It took us a good twenty minutes to collect all the feathers and pieces of the carcass into sanitary containers, then we hauled it back to the truck. Once we were done, Mike lit a cigarette and we stood watching the corn waving over the endless fields. \n `` Get a good look at it then?'' Mike asked. \n \n `` Yeah,'' I said, `` I did n't realise how fucked up they were.'' \n \n `` That's the DNA splicing. About ten different animals in there: birds, pigs, mice, you name it.'' \n \n `` Humans?'' \n \n `` Nope, that'd be illegal. And believe it or not that thing was created legally.'' \n \n `` By Apple.'' \n \n `` By Apple. It was for a product launch. Their iHolocube, about twelve years back, remember it? Well they wanted to make a big splash at the reveal, and it just so happened they had a skunkworks gene splicing lab. I mean, all the big companies did back then, before the government cracked down. Someone had the bright idea of making angels, actual angels, by splicing bird and mammal DNA.'' \n \n `` See the idea was to only create a few. Maybe a dozen or so. They'd be released into the air at the event, where they fly around like they were trained to do. Nobody would get a really good look at them, enough to see the seams, so to speak, and then they'd be put back into captivity. I guess they'd be kept as pets for a while, or just disposed of. Except they never even made it to the launch. There was an accident at the lab, and the whole flock escaped. What's more, they were n't sterile, like they were supposed to be. They bred. And bred. And now they've spread all over the country, but particularly in the midwest. For whatever reason, the climate here suits them.'' \n \n `` That's a crazy story,'' I said. \n \n `` It is,'' Mike replied. `` But it's what I've been told. In a way there's a kind of poetry to it.'' \n \n `` How so?'' \n \n `` Well, scripture says God in heaven created the angels, and then created man. Then the first species we create all on our own is an angel. Makes you wonder what those tech boys might cook up next.'' With that, he finished his cigarette and we climbed back into the truck. \n \n `` It's about time for lunch,'' Mike said. `` I know a decent diner not too far from here. Say, you ever eaten one of these things?''\n"}

I broke off the feathered end of the two arrows, leaving the metal ends inside my body. \n \n I looked up, dark clouds covered the sky, an invisible barrier created a dome across the grave of swords, a tomb for the fallen knights of the kingdom, stopping each droplet of water from falling anywhere near my princess. \n \n I looked ahead at the challenge that faced me, three Tridats, warriors forged through the earths core, mighty warriors capable of magic that could topple mountains and strength that could sunder earths. \n \n Their swords created from the hearts of dragons and their armors from their scales. \n \n Each put on their helmet in silence, grotesque obsidian metal with three jagged tips at the top. \n \n I clenched the hilt of my greatsword with brutish force, preparing myself for the challenge that lay ahead, my eyes widened, time began to slow to a snails pace, once more two of the Tridat pulled on their bows with monstrous strength, the wood made from mountain oak, the arrow head was made from a dragons teeth. \n \n With extreme coordination both arrows released from their quivers, its power so mighty, it rended a path through the earth beneath it, pushing against the sound barrier. I cheated a small glance to Karien behind me, her dress already dirty with mud, she held her hands together in hope and in prayer, I turn back towards the enemy ahead, determination filled me to my core. \n \n A one handed swing of my dragons heart greatsword stops the arrows in their tracks, my arms goes numb from the impact, but I would not dare show it, as the arrows begin to fall from the air like feathers. \n \n `` You dare attack she who I have sworn to protect?'' I mutter. \n \n Once more my eyes widened, once more time moved ever slowly, I lifted the heel of my foot, power surged through me, disappearing and appearing before one the Tridat, my blade fell upon him like an executioners sword, his reaction slow, his body cleaved in half. \n \n Already my eyes fell onto my next target, he dropped his bow and arrow and raised his sword - too slow - his sword shattered into pieces, his body too was split in half, I could feel the dragons rage steer inside me, boiling my blood, turning me into a beast. \n \n The final Tridat jumped backwards, his reaction a little faster than the others, he drew on his bow, his aim steady, he waited, as if his fall would take him a lifetime, I pounced like a beast, reason turning dark in my mind, at this range, I was in his range, not even I could stop it, it would be a life for a life. \n \n I caught a tiny smirk in the Tridats fall, panic rose from within me, dragging my sanity back from the deepest abyss. \n \n A silent `` no'' is all I could muster, the Tridat turned to his side, in a moment the arrow released from his bow, *I was too late* I thought, already before the arrow even pierced Karien, I saw her death before my eyes a million times over, her face, her face as I failed her. \n \n *No* screamed a consciousness inside of me, I stepped upon the gravel ground, my step shattering it, creating a little crater, *I need more* the crater grew ever so slighty, *I do n't care if my bones turn to ash and my blood boils out of my veins, * ***more***; power like never before surged through me, the tiny crater upon my step grew monstrous, an explosion helped me leap towards Karien, desperation, honour, duty, *love* beckoned me forward, I ran, I ran until I ran along side the arrow. \n \n I could not pass it, until I saw Kariens face, tears ran down her eyes, that was the motivation I needed, in a single moment of explosive power I burst through the sound barrier. \n \n Blood splattered her face, and horror painted it. I coughed out blood onto her dress, `` I got your dress all dirty, silly me, sorry, m'lady,'' her hands once more shook in terror, the words she was looking for got stuck in her throat. \n \n A gaping twisting hole pierced through my chest, the arrow I caught with both my hands as it pierced through me, blood from catching it and from the hole in my chest dripped down from the arrow and my gauntlets, smoke lifting from where I caught it. \n \n I looked at her, her eyes filled with pity, her tears continued to come down, `` you know,'' I said, `` what is the point in me stopping the rain, if you end up soaking yourself anyway.'' I said, wiping her tear away with my gauntlet, a chuckled sob escaped her lips. \n \n The Tridat flashed towards us in a second, my sword moved like it was swatting a fly, the final Tridat was down. \n \n I fell upon my knees, the glow of my armor was fading, I felt... smaller, the barrier above me flickered, I tried to stay awake, `` I... promised,'' I murmured, the barrier fails, the rain began to fall down, again I formed another barrier, smaller in size, holding the rain up, an igloo, that cut off the rest of the world from this very moment. \n \n `` Looks like, I wo n't even be able to do this much, Karien.'' I said, half to myself. \n \n `` Its ok, you do n't have to do this anymore, I relieve you of your duty for tonight, but I better see you in the morning.'' She said, in half sobs. \n \n *For royalty she was always such a mess, * I thought. \n \n `` See you tomorrow, m'lady,'' I replied. \n \n `` See you tomorrow,'' she said softly, slightly hopeful. \n \n I stepped up and stumbled forward, the final barrier broke apart, my last breath escaping me, my sword plunged into the sand, supporting my body, the light faded from my eyes, as my towering corpse, loomed over Karien, even in death, I held back the rain.\n"}

Something about the happy, dreamy music or the rides they came from brought out the child that was all-too-often dormant. \n \n Whenever I could I would take her there, with the roller coasters she would never be tall enough to ride and the candy floss which somehow ended up in her blonde hair. I'd take her to the park. For all of those afternoons, she forgot about the cancer. And when she forgot, I forgot, and we could both sleep well the following night. \n \n Our house was on the other side of town, not a 20 minute drive from Dreamland. Of course, with the traffic waiting to get in it could take longer, but not so much that it was a hassle for us. I could bring her there whenever she wanted, and when the cancer got worse the trips came more often. Then they came less often. Three days before she turned 11, we stopped going altogether. No dream lasts forever. \n \n The park is still alive and well. In the three years since we lost her, they've added a few more rides, which has lead to more lines of people going to get in.

{"prompt":"[ TT ] You 're stopped at a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere . You go into the bathroom , and look along the wall , seeing phone numbers . One catches your eye , your own ...\n","story":"Every summer in my life that I can remember, my parents had dragged our family out to Crater Lake for our annual `` Danielson weekend of fun'' as my Mom called it. Except it was n't fun, it was bullshit. If you've ever been to Crater Lake, or any lake for that matter, you would know that lakes are incredibly boring. I'm sure there are some things you can do for fun on a lake, like intertubing or jetskiing; however our outings mostly revolved around `` soaking up the sun'', whatever that means. \n \n One summer though, was certainly more interesting than the others. This summer was between my eight and ninth grade year, so as you could imagine, I was spanking the monkey A LOT that summer. The story begins on our drive up from the small town of Talent, Oregon, which was a cool 7 hours away from the lake. This drive mostly consisted of me and my siblings fighting and my mom playing Elton John CDs nobody liked. \n \n Amidst the chaos that is a packed minivan, I managed to take a subtle glance at the gas meter, and realized it was almost empty, only about 4 hours into the drive. I decided to alert the driver, my father, \n \n `` Um, Dad, we're running out of gas'' \n \n My Dad turned around and gave me the evil eye glance, this kind of confused me because I was n't entirely sure what triggered him. \n \n `` Aright, Steve, why do n't you pay for this next fillup, HUH TOUGH GUY? We'll make it, I'll just put it in Neutral when we are going downhill.'' \n \n I said nothing but I was really thinking, `` Holy shit dad that's the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.'' Sure enough we pull into a trashy gas station one hour later because the engine was starting to cough like my dog does before it throws up. \n \n As I mentioned earlier, this was a particularly `` high hormone'' time in my life, so my much ill trained 14 year old mind somehow convinced itself it would be good idea to go relieve some stress in the bathroom. I walked into the restroom and, holy shit, the smell. I seriously had no idea if I could even do the deed with such a smell, but eventually I resolved that I would just hold my breath and finish off before I needed to gasp for air. \n \n Unfortunately, this was possible. \n \n So I walk into the stall and pull down my pants, but before I can even get started, I glance up at the massive amounts of graffiti on the wall, mostly phone numbers written such as `` call xxx-xxxx for a good time!!!'' I initially shrugged it off and started my business. \n \n Whilst I proceeded I decided to look up one last time, and look at the graffiti on the wall, because well, It was the better option to gaze at. That's when I saw it. A bit lower than where my eyes met the wall, was inscribed a phone number that seemed all too familiar. In fact, it was my phone number. \n \n `` Holy Shit!'' I exclaimed, and I stopped my business right at that moment. A brigade of questions came into my mind. Was this one of my friends? Perhaps a family member from years past? I do n't think we had ever stopped at this gas station before. \n \n I began to panic, and at that moment I gasped for air after not being able to hold my breath any longer. I began to hyperventilate, no doubt breathing in massive amounts of shit particles. \n \n Then I became less concerned with discovering how the number had appeared there and more so with how to erase it, and so I frantically scrubbed it with my finger, with no success. I paused for a second and thought of how to solve this problem, how could I erase the number? At this moment I came up with what I will forever remember as the most paradoxical solution to a problem I have ever conceived. \n \n The solution was simultaneously the greatest and worst idea I've ever had. \n \n In a moment of desperation, I dipped my finger into the not-so-clean gas station toilet bowl, and used the wet finger to frantically scrub the number off the wall. After finishing my quest, I felt relieved. I pulled up my pants, left the stall, and began my journey back to the car. \n \n However as I left one last thing caught my eye. As I walked out I glanced briefly at the sink, a tool made specifically for dispensing sanitary water onto the hands. \n \n `` Fuck.'' I uttered under my breath.\n"}

Not that sleeping was better, mind you. \n \n He'd had that nightmare again. The same one he'd been having practically every night, ever since he'd got back from his tour of duty. The one where the events of said tour endlessly replayed themselves in hellish detail. \n \n He was n't a violent person by nature, but times were hard and the economy harder. He'd needed the money. So had his family, for that matter. So when those adverts had begun to spring up, from those enterprising private security firms itching to put recent cybernetic advances to use, he'd gone for it. It was a way out, if nothing else. \n \n At first, it was pretty cool. Scratch that, it was incredible. He could outrun a motorbike, lift a car with ease, and leap single-story buildings in one jump. His eyes could highlight and share targets with his squad mates and his body could shut down his very nerves if he was injured. He'd felt invincible. \n \n But some of those blessings had just as easily turned out to be curses. The monotony of endless patrols was that much worse when your brain's glucose levels were automatically filtered, keeping it at peak efficiency. Super-hearing was fine when you're listening at doors, but when an IED goes off next to your vehicle it could overwhelmed you and left you catatonic for hours, if not days. The constant stares of mistrustful wariness ( if not outright fear ) from the locals didn \u2019 t help either. \n \n And then there were the reaction times. The reaction times were the worst. \n \n He'd been jumpy, that day. Twitchy. His whole squad has been. Attacks had been on the increase in their area, with more bombs and more casualties practically every day. So when his sensors had picked up a small, roughly grenade-sized object hurtling towards them, they did n't think. They did n't have time to think. They simply reacted. In seconds they'd all turned, picked their targets and fired, each shot hitting precisely where they were targeted. \n \n The problem was that the object was n't a grenade, nor were the assailants they'd expertly shot insurgents out for blood.

And I was a prime volunteer. \n \n The combination of street performers, open drinking laws, magical Mardi Gras beads, and bourbon street almost guaranteed a blackout whenever I took a vacation there- and if they did n't, they the buddies I brought along with me would help push me over the edge. Hell, the last time we went I remember boarding the plane to get there, and I remember getting on the plane to leave. But absolutely nothing in between. \n \n Which was why I was surprised unpacking my bags by a small case tossed into a side pocket, with a disk inside. And stapled to the front, almost in a gruesome manner, was a receipt from *Vick's VooDoo*, made out by scrawling handwriting, with a row of symbols along the bottom. \n \n I'd stayed home from work that day, the hangover from the trip still pounding in my head, my stomach releasing smells long since declared illegal by the Geneva convention. And with nothing better to do, I popped the game in my computer, and I began to play. \n \n I'd never played the Sims, but I'd seen it done, and I knew how it worked. It would be best to start with something easy, a family I could model without much trouble. \n \n So I settled on the neighbors, Jim and Martha. Late thirties, boring people actually- for the past six weeks, Jim had been trying to put together an apartment complex wide barnecue for the forth of July, and I was certain he would consider it one of his top achievements. Maybe even make a spot of his resume. \n \n So in the game, I had him buy a grill and party supplies, easily outstripping their measly budget. And as I yawned, and prepared for bed, I found him a new job so his barbecue could have additional funding, and not be as lame as real life. Two times his current income- still nothing amazing, but for a man like Jim, he had struck gold. \n \n And walking to my car the next morning, Jim bumped into me at the bottom of the stairs as we excited the building, and walked over to a car parked in between two spaces, straddling the white line to provide more space. \n \n `` You're looking!,'' he said proudly, slapping the hood, `` Of a proud owner of a new Honda Civic! Drives like a champ, and let me tell you that those Chinese Engineers really know how to drive up those MPG's!'' \n \n He grinned, and waited for my acknowledgment, his eyes searching. Only Jim would need his neighbor's approval for buying a new car, especially a civic. \n \n `` Cool stuff, Jim'', I answered as I stepped into my own car, `` how'd you swing that?'' \n \n `` New job at the plant!'' He shouted back, `` And whewee, did it come with extra green!'' \n \n `` Congrats,'' I muttered, and started to close the door, cutting off his words. \n \n `` And do n't forget this next weekend is the barbecue- I bought a new grill and-'' \n \n But the door was shut, and I was already on my morning grind. And it was n't until the second stoplight that the realization hit me. The thought pulled at me all day at work until I clocked out that day, and I fired up The Sims. And I put my theory to the test. \n \n The walls between out apartment were thin- so thin, I could often hear snippets of speech. And I experimented. \n \n I clicked *argue*, and Jim's voice would float over about how his wife should make potato salad instead of mashed potatoes for the barbecue, and he *did not give s damn* whether she had won blue ribbon ten years before at the fair for her Tater Tornado. \n \n Then I could make them high five in the heat of it, the stands coming through the drywall. \n \n And I heard the make up sex I commanded, probably their first in years, the sounds cringeworthy as I decided never to select that option again. But I smiled, looking at the receipt from Vick's Voodoo on the ground, and reading the text for the first time. \n \n `` *You may not remember me, but I'll remember you, Mr. Tim. Take this, as a parting gift. A way of giving you what you have earned. * \n \n And on the computer, I selected *New Game*, buying my lip in thought of who I should choose next.

I was 15, no idea what I wanted to do with my life. How could I? My mother worked two jobs, my brothers had to work at the lumber yard to provide for himself and his family, and my father decided when I was 2 months old that he would go to the store for diapers. That was 15 years ago. I hated him for what he had done to my family, specifically to my mom. She was such a good women and he just left her with a 6 year old kid and a small child. \n \n To keep myself preoccupied and because I had no friends to talk and sit with at the bus stop like all of the other children awaiting the bus, I would remember the day I found some of my dad's old things. They were mainly old clothes and what not. One day however, I found a photo of him when he was around my age. He looked nothing like me, almost as if he was n't my father. My mom told me that I had the same ears as him, almost to reassure me that he was and always will be my father. On that day I vowed to hate him, not only hate him, but wish his death. \n \n I found that photo today. My mom wanted me to stay home from school because she knew something was wrong with me when I did n't eat or talk before she left. I knew if I stayed home that he had won. I could n't allow to happen. I reassured her I was fine, that nothing was wrong with me. I left for the bus stop. \n \n Anger had taken over me. I was poor, overweight, and without guidance from a father that looked nothing like me. My eyes began tearing up as a few of the football players began walking up after they walked down from the West Hills residential area. A place my mother dreamed of living, a place I even dreamed of living. I shot a glance towards one of them, hoping I could possibly get a conversation with some of the coolest kids in school, maybe they could even comfort me in a time I needed someone. That was not the case. \n \n `` What are you looking at fattie?'' The one I glanced at screamed. The other that was with him seemed not want to engage in the altercation, because he just stood there. Kyle was the boys name that screamed at me and he was walking towards me. `` Look everyone, chubs here is crying, like a fat baby!'' he yelled to the other kids. I was stood up, hoping to be able to run back home before I was beat like all of the other times however, when I stood from the bench, I felt someone jump onto my back, I realized Kyle had jumped onto my back, I rolled to try and get up but he began to hit me. My stomach, chest, and face were being pummeled. I tried to pull him away, but I could n't move him. I began to cry, I wanted my dad to be there to stop them, to protect me. `` Dad!'' I began to scream. \n \n `` Dominique?'' Mr. Larson asked. I awoke from my motionless state and realized I was back in the real world. I realized everyone was staring at me. I must have been daydreaming for around 30 minutes. `` You know Dominique, if you applied just a little bit of energy into your studies as you do daydreaming, you would be an A+ student. Allison, can you please explain to Dominique how to do the problem on the board?'' Mr. Larson turned away from Dominique. Dominique stared around the class as everyone stared at Allison as she stood at the board working the math problem. Dominique looked down to see if he had any notes on the lesson they were on. When he noticed that he must have been drawing while he was daydreaming. The drawing was a kid sitting on the bench with a caption that read `` I miss my dad.'' Dominique sat back and chuckled at himself, and wrote on the top of the page, `` I have a vivid imagination.''\n"}

His own chance to bathe in the filthy loads of karma bestowed upon him by envious writers. `` Why had n't I thought of that?'' or `` Mmm, that's very clever.''

A simply unique idea that only his mind was capable of forming. * With a final smirk he clicked the save, quickly navigating back to the new posts to see his trophy placed upon the shelf. \n \n There it was.

{"prompt":"[ OT ] Sunday Free Write : Peanuts Edition\n","story":"I was experimenting with a sci-fi dystopian thing. \n \n -- - \n \n Special Agent Ganier walked down the bustling street. People unconsciously stepped aside to allowing him to pass with ease. The ocular implants would n't allow anyone to see him but they sent information to the brain telling them to move out of his way. \n \n `` The apartment building coming up on your right Ganier.'' Agent Emerson's soft female voice said into his earpiece. \n \n He nodded knowing they could see him from the countless cameras that were located around the street. Every building, pole, streetlight, mail box was fixed with a camera. Nothing went unseen in the city of Jericho. \n \n `` The target is located on the sixth floor, apartment number sixty three.'' Emerson said. \n \n `` I know Emerson, I got the same briefing you did,'' Ganier said. \n \n `` Fine. You know you always get like this before an op.'' Emerson said. \n \n `` Get like what?'' \n \n `` A dick.'' \n \n Emerson was n't dealing with the break up very well. \n \n `` Roger that,'' Ganier said sarcastically. \n \n He tried to clear his mind of Emerson and walked up the concrete steps of the apartment building. A young woman walked out pushing a stroller. Ganier caught the door and held it for her. She looked at the door askance for a second and then shrugged. \n \n Ganier slipped inside and went to the elevators. He pressed the button and waited. After a few seconds he pressed the button rapidly. It probably did n't do anything but it made him feel better. Eventually the elevator stopped and the doors slid open. He waited for the young couple to step out before he walked inside. He pressed six and slid the pistol out of his shoulder holster. The target he was after had been hacking government websites for the past few days. It had taken a number of experts to trace his location back to this building. According to the analysts it was a lucky break. This guy was good, probably as good as they had ever seen. Ganier rolled his shoulders and took a deep breath. They wanted him alive to interrogate him so he would tell them how he broke in to their systems. \n \n Alive always got messy. \n \n The elevator stopped at the sixth floor and Ganier stalked out like a jungle cat that caught the scent of its prey. Apartment sixty three was at the end of the hall, the red door and gold numbers stood out in Ganier's enhanced vision. \n \n `` Activate citizen safety measures,'' Ganier said into his earpiece. Emerson punched a command into the computer she was sitting at and Ganier began to emit a signal that suggested anyone on this floor would stay inside their apartment. It was a helpful tool for reducing collateral damage. \n \n He stopped at apartment sixty three's door and knocked. Of course there was no answer. He took a step back and smiled. This was his favorite part. He pulled his foot back and kicked. His foot impacted the door with a thunderous crash sending the door flying into the apartment. Hinges could n't compete with his enhanced strength. He rushed inside behind the flying door and began clearing rooms. His vision could detect heat signatures, and pick up on even the slightest movement. To his disappointment the apartment was empty. \n \n `` Emerson, yeah the target is n't here.'' \n \n `` He was. Find something.'' She snapped angrily. \n \n `` Women...'' Ganier said quietly to himself. \n \n He holstered the pistol and began to look around more closely. The rooms were completely empty except for a single cot in the bedroom. There were empty food containers stacked in the kitchen and a few unopened beers in the fridge. \n \n A hacker or a college student could have been living here. He opened the closet door in the bedroom. \n \n The explosion sent him flying backwards into the wall. He smashed cleanly through the drywall and studs before coming to a stop in the adjacent apartment. Strong arms grabbed him and dragged him off the floor. The ringing in his ears was deafening. He could n't see anything but an after image of the explosion. Ganier struggled against the arms but he was too weak. They strapped him into a chair, he felt a sharp pain in his neck as a syringe was stabbed into him. \n \n `` That should help you calm down Agent Ganier.'' A young man said as he walked into view. \n \n It was a strange effect seeing the silhouette of the man behind the white flare permanently embedded in his vision. \n \n `` Are your eyes bothering you? Well you did just take a large amount of C4 to the face. I am surprised you are doing as well as you are to be honest.'' \n \n `` What do you want?'' Ganier shouted as he struggled against his bindings. \n \n `` I want you to see the truth Agent Ganier.'' The man said with a smile. \n \n The sound of a drill spun to life outside of Ganier's peripheral. \n \n `` We only have a few minutes make it fast doctor.'' The man said stepping away. He was replaced by an old man wearing a white lab coat. \n \n `` This may hurt a bit,'' he said sadly. \n \n `` What will hurt?'' Ganier asked trying to move his head to see. The thick strap across his forehead made it impossible to move. \n \n `` This.'' \n \n The doctor plunged a spinning drill into Ganier's eye. Pain erupted inside his mind as the drill tore apart his ocular implant. The pain was too much and Ganier blacked out. \n \n He woke up still strapped to the chair. He did n't know how much time had passed but he could still feel the echoes of the drill tearing into his eye. Heavy footsteps thundered down the hallway. They breached the door and piled inside. \n \n `` Holy shit Ganier, you look awful,'' Emerson said as her face came into view. \n \n His vision was blurry but he could still see the concern plain on her face. \n \n `` Cut him loose he needs a doctor,'' she shouted to the men. \n \n They made quick work of the straps and helped him stand. His legs were weak but he refused to let the men see just how weak he was. He walked on his own out of the apartment and to the elevator. Emerson pressed the button and helped him inside where he collapsed. \n \n `` You stubborn bastard.'' \n \n `` I know,'' he mumbled, pain kept shooting through his face like lightning bolts. \n \n `` What did they do to me?'' he asked. \n \n `` I do n't know we have n't touched the eye patch,'' she said. \n \n `` Eye patch?'' \n \n `` May I?'' she asked. \n \n He nodded slowly. She reached out and gingerly removed the eye patch covering his right eye. \n \n She gasped and fell backward. \n \n `` What? What is it?'' Ganier asked in a panic. \n \n `` Your eye... they... replaced your eye.'' \n \n Ganier blinked against the blinding fluorescent light. His right eye was blurry and unfocused. \n \n `` What do you mean replaced it?'' He asked. \n \n `` You do n't have a digital implant anymore. You have a regular... eye.'' \n \n A voice in Ganier's mind interrupted their conversation. \n \n `` You must be wondering what's going on Ganier. You're about to see for yourself.'' \n \n The elevator stopped at the ground floor and Emerson helped Ganier up. \n \n `` Jesus you are heavy,'' she grunted. \n \n They shuffled out of the apartment building and down the concrete steps. Ganier gasped and stopped. \n \n `` What are you doing?'' she asked. \n \n The entire city was different. Sprawling beautiful buildings were replaced with run down structures that were falling apart. He turned and looked at the apartment they had just left. The once perfectly laid red bricks were stained and broken. Windows were boarded up and the place looked condemned. \n \n People walked by them wearing little more than rags. They all smiled and talked happily blissfully unaware of the filth they were walking past. \n \n `` Yes Ganier. Now you understand. I have torn the veil away from your eyes. Now you see the truth of the world we live in.'' The voice in his mind was a little more than a whisper. \n \n `` You are all puppets. You are all living a carefully constructed lie. In the land of the blind the man with one eye is king.'' Laughter echoed through his mind. \n \n Ganier collapsed to the broken sidewalk. \n \n -- - \n \n [ Part 2 ] ( https: \/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Written4Reddit\/comments\/5buven\/rf_part_2_digital_ocular_implants_that_are_now\/ ) \n\n"}

When the sun goes down and the tourists are gone he walks past the Alamo on his way to a bar that \u2019 ll give him food wether he has money or not and then to a liquor store that, for money, will sell him a couple of forties. It \u2019 s a special deal, buy one get one for regular price. \n \n One Sunday, after a sleepless night in the winter wind his joints were stiff and Paul decided to go for a walk. The clearing around the Alamo lets the sun shine through and keeps things warm so he thought he \u2019 d walk through there. The sun shone down on the clearing but things weren \u2019 t warm. \n \n In front of the old building people moved in crowds- in, out, around the building but the crowds parted around a single man standing up on a step ladder he \u2019 d brought. The man was reading aloud from an old, old book calling out to the crowd a message of fear and damnation. Paul smiled hearing the old words and made his way through the crowds to the man and stood just in front of him listening. The speaker was old, his skin as wrinkled and tanned as the book but not quite so much as Paul, especialy while he was smiling. \n \n After a time the man reached a stoping point and Paul interrupted him. \n \u201c Fantastic book, \u201d he said \u201c I, uh, have to disagree with you on some points though. \u201d \n \n The man ignored him and started shouting again. \u201c The damnation part specifically, \u201d Paul continued \u201c Lakes of fire, trident wielding demons. Haha. No, that \u2019 s not how he punishes. Ceaselessly though, you said that earlier, \u201d Paul shivered, he was so cold, \u201c you \u2019 ve got that bit right. \u201d \n \n Then finally, the reader closed the book and looked down at Paul. \u201c You too, huh? \u201d he said. \u201c Yeah, \u201d Paul replied \u201c Me too. \u201d \n \n Then they both turned and walked away and the stool stood alone in the sun.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Pope francis starts to recruit for a new cruisade .\n","story":"When Pope Francis had used his visit to the White House to rally the youth of today to take up arms in a holy crusade, he had not expected this result... Oh, sure. Some children, and parents too, had done exactly as their pontiff and commander had instructed and come to meet him in the streets of New York to join his glorious cause. \n \n `` Some,'' was the key word there, though. Maybe one-thousand faithful, if he was being generous, had actually taken up the call. Did n't the Catholics of today realize the dangers they were up against as children of Christ? Did n't they too see the evils of gay marriage and gay rights? Pope Francis was beginning to wonder if it all had been in vain. \n \n Had the world moved on, past the Word of God's infallible chosen one? No, it could n't be! The Papacy was as strong as ever, and so was the faith of the Catholic people, right? \n \n Wrong. As these things no go, Francis' calling of a crusade was decisively mocked the world over, dwindling the already dented public image the Catholic Church had enjoyed over the last few decades. Media personalities made lighthearted jabs at the Pope's calling of a holy war against the gay community, while kids on the internet relentlessly made meme after meme about Francis and his `` crusade.'' \n \n Even worse, the US Government had not taken lightly to Francis hijacking the White House broadcast to call for a war against the homosexual community. There was already enough trouble brewing in the nation, and the ever-growing divides between the American people did n't need the Pope to split them wider. Francis was not-so-kindly asked to leave, and his `` soldiers,'' the select few who had taken up his banners, were detained and held on treason charges. \n \n Back in the Vatican, the Pope, now the subject of global mockery and figurehead ruler of a perhaps fatally-damaged religion pontificated on his mistake. Could it be that Gay Marriage was n't really all that big an issue? Was it possible that maybe he, the Pope ho lived in Vatican City in Europe, did n't really have the answers to America's problems and politics? \n \n `` No...'' Francis quietly decided. It was the young people's fault. They had turned away from God, and embraced false idols, called facebook, twitter, and worst of all, reddit. Francis decided then and there to rescue these lost, young souls. But he needed to find the best way to do it. \n \n After much deliberation, he reached the ideal solution. \n \n He began to lay down the tracks for his new Prog-Rock album the next day.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're a tourist visiting London . While cutting through a back alley to get to a pub , you stumble upon a corgi made of solid gold . Said corgi decides to follow you around .\n","story":"[ 1\/2 Ideas ] \n \n `` Go on. Get out of here.'' \n \n The dog instead stuck its nose to the ground, as if its little golden nub could smell anything. \n \n Camila tossed a chip at it, catching the dog's attention. The chip, devoured within moments, made the strangest slurping sound as the pure gold corgi swallowed it. \n \n So it was a still functional corgi, despite it's golden status. \n \n Standing in the alley way, body blocking the little pup's abnormal status from prying eyes, she had to wonder how that happened to be. Glamouring of a normal dog to appear pure gold was not as much high level magic as childish and potentially animal cruelty. The London Witches' Board to Prevent Harm to Magical and Non-Magical Creatures ( LWBTHMNC or Lubthank ) was going to scoop this little one up and therefore this dog was not her problem. The question was if any of the no-Mag's would be able to see it as a golden corgi or just a normal corgi. \n \n The dog, completely oblivious to her thoughts, kept jumping up at her hand, trying to get more chips. The little golden tag on it's collar bounced and jangled. \n \n `` Come here, little one.'' She reached out for the collar. \n \n 1393 Hearst Street, London \n \n The dog had n't gotten far from it's owner then. \n \n Using the chips, all cold and soggy now, as a distraction, she scooped the pup up and tucked it, squirming like all hell, under her coat. \n \n Hearst Street was just two blocks over and 1393 was just a simple brownstone with nothing in particular to make it stand out. In fact, if she was n't looking for it, she would n't have seen it at all. \n \n Taking the steps two at a time, she approached the door, ready to magic the damn thing open to give the owner a piece of her mind. Gold corgis loose in London. Stupid. \n \n The door swung open on her approach and Camila ran straight through a girl. \n \n `` Sorry! Oh!'' The pup squirmed out of her arms and ran straight into the back of the house. \n \n `` Ami, what are you doing out?'' The girl, no, ghost, closed the door and drifted right through Camila, following the sharp, metallic clatter of paws. \n \n Camila followed. \n \n The house was beautifully lit, a far cry from the soggy, misty weather in London and Camila immediately recognized some of the locales through the windows, the city streets of Paris, Tokyo, New York, Sydney, and the beautiful greenery and snow and deserts of far away places. It was a witch's house, or a rare wizard's. \n \n `` Hello?'' As she entered the kitchen, the windows shifted to a beautiful field in the afternoon. If she had to guess, Camila would have said that was off in the midwest of the states somewhere. \n \n The ghost poured water into the dog's equally golden bowl. `` Ah, hello, sorry about that. Ami gets a little excited sometimes and runs off to who knows where.'' \n \n Camila clutched the strap of her bag. Casual talk like that would get the witch censured in the States. No magic where magic did n't go. `` It really should n't be doing that. We ca n't have word getting out about magic dogs running in the streets of London.'' \n \n The girl shrugged. `` Try as I can to keep her in here, she gets out somehow. I ca n't leave the house of course, so I ca n't figure out how. She comes back when she wants.'' \n \n She wiped her hands, now gloved, on her apron and held one out. `` Laura.'' \n \n Camila took it, surprised that the hands were now solid. \n \n Laura smiled, pulling her hand back and putting a kettle on the stove. `` The gloves help a lot. I practically become a real person, if everything is charmed right. Do you prefer green or black?'' \n \n `` Uh, I have to go.'' \n \n `` Please do n't!'' Laura, dark eyes pleading, held out two tins of tea. `` We hardly see anyone and the mistress has n't been home in ages.'' \n \n Camila edged toward the door. `` Mistress?'' \n \n Laura moved forward slightly. `` Yes! Mistress Oriole has n't been by and little Ami misses her dearly.'' \n \n `` Uh, I ca n't really help with that.'' \n \n `` But, please, stay awhile. Ami never brings anyone home and I've never met an American before. Is it as nice as they say?'' \n \n `` Uh... I mean, I guess?'' \n \n `` Oh, I wish I could go! I could be in New York right now! I could see Guys and Dolls on Broadway!'' \n \n `` Guys and Dolls?'' Camila paused. `` Laura, do you know what year it is?'' \n \n Laura paused. `` 1995, right?'' \n \n Camila shook her head, pulling out her smartphone. `` Laura, I hate to break it to you, but it's 2017.'' \n \n Laura look down at the dog and the dog back to her. \n \n `` Oh, dear.''\n"}

He had sabotaged the machine. He had fled to the bathroom every time he saw a bleary eyed morning zombie trudging up to his desk, brandishing a thermos. There was no escape today, though. Edgar had him cornered in his cubicle, his beady eyes shining with suspicion. He knew, and he would have answers. `` Sam, is n't it your turn to make coffee today?'' \n \n Time stopped, though in the split-second prior, Edgar had just enough time to begin to roll his eyes. Sam skidded over to his computer, the golden question spilling from his fingertips. `` how to brew coffee'' vanished in the search bar, replaced by a Google query, but no answer. The telltale dinosaur blinked on his browser, and Sam smacked his forehead: the Internet did n't work during a time stop. \n \n Sam leapt from his seat, darting past Edgar, and began to navigate the maze of frozen people. Several heads poked out of cubicles, faces pointed towards the coffee machine sitting in the back of the room. Expectation lingered in their frozen eyes as they waited for their savior to deliver them from the morning drudgery. Sam pored over the cup, the back of the machine, and even a stray coffee filter, but none bore the bible of brewery he needed. \n \n He sighed, picking at the creases in his shirt. He worked in data entry, for crying out loud; there was only one type of filter he knew about. The supervisors had no grounds for delegating coffee duty to an spreadsheet monkey, even at Starbucks's corporate office. But Sam had asserted his proficiency as a barista at the job interview, and lying was grounds for a reprimand at the very least. So he pressed onwards, clattering down the stairs, in search for a solution. Did the Starbucks's offices have a library? A printing center? A cute step-by-step wall adornment teaching kids and hapless interns how to make their own coffee? \n \n As it turned out, they had none of the above, but they did have their own cafe, nestled in an alcove on the first floor. A barista slumped against the counter, watching the coffee timer tick down\u2014or rather, not tick down, as the case currently was. *Of all the time to pause time*, Sam thought. He would've stolen the pot if it had been ready. An idea struck him: his eyes fell upon the coffee drinkers spread throughout the cafe, cups pressed to their lips. One by one, he gathered their drinks, five in total, and began to climb back upstairs. \n \n It occurred to Sam that he ought to have taken them up on a tray. Or even bring the coffeepot downstairs and perform the transferal there. This occurrence occurred approximately one second before one of the cups sprang loose of his teetering hold, and a hot liquid came pouring out, spilling onto and through his shirt. Though pain seared in his side, Sam managed to persevere up the remaining stairs and all the way through the office door. His reward was half a pot of murky brown FrankenCoffee that smelled like an identity crisis. \n \n Sam's knees buckled, and he collapsed onto the floor, his head rolling upwards. He needed more time, more energy, to fill the pot completely. From the domed ceiling, the Starbucks mermaid stared at him, a silent siren's song emanating from her pursed lips. She offered Sam a promise, a promise of liquid glory and rejuvenation. He accepted, crawling to his feet and lifting the pot to his lips. \n \n It tasted like shit and backwash. \n \n Edgar blinked as time resumed. `` Well?'' \n \n Sam straightened his shirt, not even attempting to hide the brown stains. `` Someone broke the coffee machine again.''\n"}

But how could this happen? \n \n I lost her a month ago, in a car crash. She did n't survive. I still heard her voice time to time, But this... this was something else... \n \n I was crushed by an huge wave of thoughts, feelings and memories. At first I thought it's just a dream. I pinched myself in the arm, I should wake up now. Nothing happens, she's still there looking at me in confusion. \n \n `` What's wrong Ash?'' \n \n My mind was frozen. I could n't even answer her. Then I see our Christmas tree. We decorated it together. Ever since I lost her, I kept living in every memory I had with her. And last Christmas was one of the best ones I had. \n \n `` Umm, nothing just... `` I stopped for a second, getting my thoughts together and then continued `` Just got that Christmas feeling''. She laughed. I missed her smile the most. \n \n I did n't care if it was a dream or not. I was enjoying being around her again. I was hoping it was real. \n \n `` Sooo... Breakfast!'' I yelled while rushing to the kitchen. I heard her giggle in the bed as I was going out the door. \n \n I grabbed the milk from the fridge, then something attracted my attention. The calendar on the fridge door was showing December 2015. I put the milk on the kitchen table in suspence and went back to the room to grab my phone. And I realized that it's my old phone. She bought me a new phone for Christmas last year. How detailed this dream is, I thought. I checked my phone; December 21st 2015. What is going on? \n \n If I was dreaming, I would have been awake by now. But does this mean I traveled back in time? \n \n I spent the morning just thinking about it all, and took every chance to look at her another time. I think I creeped her out. Soon it was nighttime, and I just knew that it is real. \n \n I talked about it with her in the bed, she just laughed. She thought I'm just making it up to have a conversation. \n \n Days passed and I was still struggling. Things sort of happened the way I remembered them. Christmas came and she gave me her present. It was an iPhone. Exactly the same one, with the note on the back of it saying `` For my love, Ash''. Same went for every other event. I was just living 2016 again. With every crappy thing that happened in it. \n \n I was really happy that I got the chance to have her again, but something bothered me. I was counting down the days until the accident. The fact that I knew she was going to die that day was the most unsettling thing I ever experienced, even worse than the loss itself. I did n't want to lose her again, and it was torturing me everyday. \n \n The day came. I was scared as all hell. It was our anniversary and we were going out for a romantic dinner. I did n't let her drive, maybe that will prevent the accident from happening. \n \n It's been three months since that day... Since I last saw her. The accident did n't happen. But she left me that night. We had an argument and things went wrong... Seems that the fear of that day changed me too much. I guess I was destined to lose her... \n \n So this was my first time writing anything, any feedback is appreciated. Hope you enjoyed it.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ EU ] In a corner of Hyrule , one man has the bright idea of starting a pot-repairing business .\n","story":"Guyver, old and portly, waddled over and placed the freshly glued pot on the counter with a satisfied smile. \n `` There you are! Now, perhaps you should be a little more careful next time'' he said to the customer with a chuckle. \n \n \n She narrowed her eyes; `` I *am* careful. It makes no difference when that green menace is around. In he comes, whirling and tumbling, waving that sword of his, then off he disappears with *my* rupees!'' \n \n \n `` Speaking of which...'' he eyed the large woman's satchel, she begrudgingly handed him a red rupee. \n \n \n `` You know, some say the green menace is doing us a service, protecting the Kingdom from the-'' \n \n \n `` I do n't care what he is doing or why! He's a nuisance and a thief, though I am sure his wanton destruction does not bother you one bit!'' She sniffed, and exited the little shop in a huff. \n \n \n That was the last pot repair of the day. Guyver took a moment to admire his shelves, stacked high with pots of different shapes and sizes, all ready for collection. Some beautiful and ornate with gold trim, some small and modest, but all shared one thing; once broken, now repaired. \n \n \n The green menace coming to the quiet little town had certainly been a windfall for him, enraged families queued outside his quaint little shop, piles of broken pots filled their arms and piles of rupees filled his pockets. \n Humming happily to himself as he pottered to the workshop, stacks of broken pots towered high above his short stature, shards big and small covered the floor like a pointy porcelain carpet. \n *Many more pots to repair*, he thought, *and many more rupees to collect*. \n \n \n His eyes spied the large chest in the corner of the room, twirling his curly brown mustache in anticipation he shuffled over. With one big heave it was open, and the brilliant bright dazzle of thousands of rupees greeted him. \n `` Hello shiny little friends!'' he said gleefully as he dropped the bright red rupee into the chest. It joined the others with a light *plink! * and Guyver chuckled again, his little round face lit up by the glow of his treasure. \n \n \n The sound of a small creak interrupted his chain of thought, nervously he glanced around the room, but there was nothing there. With another big heave he closed the wooden chest, and made his way upstairs. \n A warm glass of Lon Lon milk, and Guyver was tucked up in his little round bed. Sleepily, he thought of all the careful gluing he would do tomorrow, and how much fuller his wooden chest would become. \n \n \n The next day was like all others, customers dropped off and collected their pots, and Guyver had happily hummed and whistled to himself the whole while. As a treat, he decided to go to the nightly auction house. Armed with a bag full of his precious rupees he made a silent oath to himself that he would buy that beautiful piece of heart he had so been wanting. The auction was over as quickly as it began, and like his disgruntled customers, many left the auction house grumbling as Guyver carried his piece of heart home. Won for a record price of just 50 rupees as most of the townsfolk money was tucked away safely in Guyvers chest. \n \n \n Another glass of Lon Lon milk and he was sound asleep, the piece of heart placed proudly above his bed. But as Guyver was dreaming of rupees, red, blue, green and silver, the shop door creaked slowly open. \n The sound of hushed steps making their way to his workshop did not wake him, nor did the loud `` Hyah!'' that cried out, as one of his carefully repaired pots smashed to pieces. But what did wake him from that deep slumber was a loud fanfare of victorious sounding music, he shot out of bed and waddled quickly down to the workshop, images of his rupee dream fast disappearing. \n \n \n `` No, please do n't!'' he said with a soft cry. \n A young blonde boy held a pile or rupees above his head. He was dressed strangely, a green tunic and a pointy green hat. \n `` The green meance!'' he spluttered, hands waving wildly. \n The boy was looking overjoyed at his find, but his face turned sombre when he saw the tears welling up in Guyvers eyes. Before the boy had a chance to speak, Guyver shot upstairs, whimpering softly to himself all the way. He returned quickly though, holding the piece of heart he had won just hours before. \n `` Here!'' he cried. `` Please take this, smash all the pots, just leave my rupees, please!'' \n The boy looked at Guyver, then the piece of heart, and again at Guyver. He carefully set the stack of rupees back into the chest and took the piece of heart from him. Another, even more triumphant fanfare sounded, and the boy grinned happily, Guyver did too. \n \n \n He went to thank the boy, but in a blur of green and blonde he whizzed out of the little shop. The following day he would discover that the boy had left the town altogether, onto the next stage of his noble quest. \n \n \n From that day, never again was a pot purposefully broken. The town's people were overjoyed as their rupees were no longer pilfered and their belongings were no longer broken. \n Though Guyvers shop was quiet now, he did not mind one bit, as his workshop was empty from shards of broken pottery, his wooden chest was still stuffed with rupees, and his belly was still full of Lon Lon milk. \n\n"}

The first space battle in human history is about to begin .\n","story":"First time writing something here, so I understand if it's shit. \n \n Captain Hollister drew a long, slow breath in through his nose. He had to remain calm, if not for himself then for the crew of his ship, The Hercules. It had been 5 weeks since the colonies of Mars split from the Terran Empire, and in that time Hollister and his comrades had mobilised. \n \n Three battlegroups, comprising of three Hero class battleships, two State class carriers and a multitude of cruisers and other ships had departed the orbit of Luna, separating and heading towards their own objectives. The Hercules - and her sister ships the Perseus and the Achilles - was gearing up for the first major engagement of the conflict. Hollister himself was a veteran of several prior campaigns, including the now infamous Jupiter Incident. Out of the viewport ahead of him, he could see the Martian fleet. Hollister had been told by his superiors that the Martians had only a small fleet, mostly made up of relics from the colonisation of Mars. \n \n His superiors were wrong. \n \n Whereas the fleet Hollister was in was a fearsome force numbering an intimidating 56 vessels, the Martian fleet was easily twice that number. At the front of the Martians was the ship that had sparked many rumours over the years - The Mephistopheles. Some said it could n't be done, others that the rumours were just that - rumours. The Mephistopheles was bigger than all three of the battleships end to end, and allegedly carried enough nukes to render Terra no more than a charred pebble. \n \n Hollister immediately got on comms to the Achilles and the Perseus, ordering the trio of ships into a broadside, as he got confirmation from the carriers Guardian and Kingslayer that they had launched their compliments of Sparrow fighter-bombers. \n \n He watched the bright trails the nukes left behind them, and felt content. The battle was going well. So far, the Martians had n't even fired a shot, whilst the Terrans had destroyed 4 ships, and damaged a further 16. The battleships were constantly pumping out their radioactive payloads into the inky darkness of space. However, a spike of power was detected from the Mephistopheles a few moments ago. Hollister ran his gaze across his fleet, taking in the lights and the flashes off cannons. Something caught his eye. \n \n Something speeding towards the hull of the Perseus. \n \n A blinding white flash emanated from where the object struck the Perseus, and shortly before his eyes were liquidated in their sockets, Hollister saw that the Perseus had been immolated in its entirety. The Achilles, who had her front behind the Perseus, was beheaded, before going off into an uncontrollable cartwheel. The Hercules, however, took relatively light damage, with one exception. The oxygen generators had been catastrophically hit, with no chance of repairs. \n \n Hollister allowed himself a sad smile. This was how he was going to go. Not with a courageous last stand, or a noble sacrifice, but slowly, fighting for the last scraps of air as he watched the ships under his command get steamrolled. \n \n ( As I said, this is my first time posting here, so I apologise if it's shit. )\n"}

What I propose is that I should nuance my storage of tales, as in I believe YOU should tell stories to the people! \n \n `` Now do n't be alarmed or too flattered my dear Drakus, I propose that you tell me the honest and terrifying tales of your many battles with the blundering fools who sought your destruction. The people would love it!'' \n \n Drakus burst in booming laughter that shook the mighty cavern all around. He seemed almost lost to reality in his humorous reaction. \n \n `` You think me a fool? How insulting! I appreciate the originality, but you must not truly understand your role in this act, prepare to die little Dave.'' \n \n `` Whoa whoa whoa, the only one here who does n't seem to understand his situation is you. When's the last time a noble knight trekked his way in here to end you? That's right, 50 years! The truth is, Drako, is that the world has moved on. You've not let up your grip on this rich mass, which is n't even that much anymore adjusted to inflation... \n \n But anyway, you're old news! The world has changed, nobody younger than 30 even knows who you are! Parents tell their children not to play around this area, and they do n't even know why! That's your legacy Drakus! You're nothing more than a childhood hazard!'' \n \n And for the first time in one thousand years, Drakus's heart began to sink deeper in his mighty breast. \n \n `` What I am proposing, is to bring your name back to the house! Make people revere you! Respect you! *Remember* you. Let me help you Drakus, so that we can both be not just marks, but MOUNTAINS in history!'' \n \n Drakus felt a burning of hope well up inside of him, he smiled a toothy grin at Dave. \n \n `` You're... You're right, little talking man. There's no purpose in sitting on my heap of gold for eternity... wealth comes from use and respect... Not silence. Very well, little Dave, I shall trek the kingdom with you and share my experience of triumph and blood! Let the ears be shaken! Let the eyes behold! DRAKUS! THE MIGHTY DRAGON OF JAGGED ROCK RETURN!'' \n \n Drakus spread his darkened wings and lunged for the opening, at last, he would taste the tart of reality and acceptance. The kingdom would once again see fire in the sky... \n \n As Drakus freed his presence to the opening fields and sky, he unhinged a mighty funnel of flame the the heavens! \n \n Just then, a heavy iron bolt pierced deep into his gaping throat. The oily metal spear ignited with his fire, and blew Drakus into a thousand bloody pieces. \n \n Dave approached the commander with a victorious smirk. \n \n `` And our agreement, I get half the wealth and proceeds from the feasts of dragon meat... oh and the princess.'' \n \n Dave wandered into the hall of the king to meet his soon to be bride. She was a flirtatious young woman who met him with affection. \n \n `` So young dragon slayer... How can a sunny little princess like me help tend to your tensed battle wounds?'' \n \n Dave lightly chuckled. \n \n `` You can start with the loins.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Since the Salem Witch Trials , witches have gotten better at hiding ... This one slips up .\n","story":"I looked at the ticket, and then back at Sandra. There was an odd ringing in my ears, a sense of unreality, almost like being lightheaded. \n \n `` We... won?'' \n \n She did n't seem elated. If anything, she was utterly....*terrified*? I suppose sudden, unexpected wealth has a lot of possible responses, but I would n't have expected *terror* to be one of them. \n \n `` We have to move. We have to drop everything and get out of the country. *NOW! *'' \n \n `` Whoa, woha. hold on, babe. I mean... this is good, right? We can pay off the bills, get that land you were talking about, right?'' \n \n `` No! We have to leave. It was n't meant to be this much! It was just supposed to be a few hundred! A small amount to take the edge off the rent!'' \n \n I could n't quite process what I was hearing. I kept looking at the ticket in my hand, and then up at a clearly panicking Sandra. She was already halfway to the hall closet where we keep the suitcases. \n \n Kat looked up from her perch on the couch arm, her pointed ears perked up, feline nose sniffing at the air, trying to determine what was disturbing the normally unflappable Giver of Food. \n \n `` Uh, Sandra? What do you mean `` meant to?'' \n \n She pulled the big red suitcase out and shot me a distracted glance. \n \n `` What are you talking about?'' \n \n `` You just said `` this was meant to be just a few hundred dollars.''.'' I held up the ticket and pointed to it. `` You knew this would happen?'' \n \n He face froze for a second. In that half an instant I was n't sure if I was looking at Sandra Kendal, physics student at Salem State U, incredible cook, hiking fanatic, long-time girlfriend and cat-lover, or....something else. Something far removed from the woman I though I knew. \n \n `` Oh, shi... ft. Can you forget I said that?'' \n \n Then she began muttering to herself. \n \n `` What am I talking about... I do n't need to ask.'' One handed extended toward me, and lights began appearing. Whitish wisps that swirled around her hand. \n \n `` *Eradicate Memory! *'' \n \n The wisps shot out toward me... but fizzled out, vanishing like raindrops in a furnace as they left her hand. I just stood there bewildered, while some part of my mind wondered if her mental breakdown was contagious. I *thought* those mushrooms at dinner were just fine. Had I accidentally cooked up one of the crazy ones? And would a bad dinner produce wisp-light fingers? \n \n Sandra was shaking her hand, and looked up at me. Again, that half-instant of something old and otherworldly, and then she sank to the hall floor. \n \n I could recognize a sob by the way her shoulder heaved up, and was already moving. Halfway there, a black, furry missile skittered past me and cannoned into her arms, purring loudly. \n \n `` Sandra? Talk to me, babe. What's going on?'' \n \n There was a hesitation, and then a sigh. \n \n `` Three years, and I screw up. Three years, and it takes one unguarded comment to ruin it all.'' \n \n Defiantly bright eyes looked up at me. Two pairs. One from Sandra, glistening with unshed tears, and one from Kat. \n \n `` I'm a witch, Dave. A magic spell user.'' \n \n A thousand thoughts and suspicious tumbled through my mind, mentally replaying every coffee date, every band night, every hike we'd ever taken. That time we'd camped out in Maine, and got up to see the sun rise over the ocean. Our holiday to see Yosemite, the late nights laid out by the fire, cat sprawled with us as we puzzled through advanced nuclear theories. I tried to reframe that with Sandra as a *witch*, but could n't. \n \n For starters... \n \n `` That's impossible.'' Oops. I'd just blurted that out. \n \n `` Why? Is it really so hard to believe that I can reshape reality to my whim?'' \n \n Challenging tone, aggressive posture. Every boyfriend sense in my body was screaming'Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!'. I knew precisely what I should say. \n \n `` Nah, witches are supposed to be ugly. you're too beautiful to be a witch''. *Shit, that was n't right. That's not what to say in this situation. * \n \n I could *see* rage, indignation, amusement and exasperation war across her face. Amusement won, but by a fraction of a hair. Had the situation been less bizarre, I suspect rage might have won out. \n \n `` You.....you....always say *eaxctly* the rightly wrong thing.'' \n \n Sandra took a deep breath. \n \n `` I'm a witch. Was born one, raised one, and am one. My Mother was a witch, and my grandmother was one. You know of the Salem Witch Trials. That was one of the coven getting a little too carefree with her magic.'' \n \n I'd been manfully suppressing a `` that explains a lot'' comment since she mentioned her mother was a witch, but it got chased out of my head by the last comment. \n \n `` I thought the Trials were blind panic? Superstitious people lynching people so they could steal their land and money?'' \n \n `` Those were the *public* trials. The Witches Association of America was conducting their own Trials at the same time. Great-Aunt told tales of how they punished little Amelia for her fairy lights.... \n \n `` They... we....do n't like attention. Witches have always been around here, and some of them went a little power-hungry. They decided they did n't want to live'comfortable but innocous' lives as the Association had laid down, but instead started gathering their own estates. Their own fortunes.'' \n \n `` And the Witch Trials were born. How many actual witches did the mobs get?'' \n \n `` None. The Association got fifteen of the twenty-five in the area though. The rest were told to keep their heads down for their own good. Since then it's been an unwritten rule. You do n't raise your head above where it's supposed to be.'' \n \n `` And a Powerball win raises our heads a lot'' \n \n She laughed, a broken sound. \n \n `` 800 million? More than just a little!'' \n \n `` So, you used magic on the ticket?'' I held up the incriminating artifact. \n \n `` Just a tiny bit of scrying. I intentionally got some of the numbers wrong. it was meant to be a small win. Look, the four numbers....and....oh, *dustings*. \n \n `` He screwed up. The guy at the shop screwed up. I wanted that to be a 35 and it's the winning 36. And the powerball was meant to be a 8, but he typed in 9.'' \n \n A thought sprang up. *Don'tsayit, don'tsayit, don'tsayit-* \n \n `` You're not a very *good* witch are you?. Could n't what was it...'scry' this win, and your spell to I assume erase my memory did n't work either.'' \n \n She punched me in the arm. \n \n `` Spellcasting does n't work when you're emotional.'' \n \n *DON'TSAYIT, DON'TSAYIT, DON'TSAYIT-* \n \n `` Oh, come on, you're bursting to say something.'' \n \n *Whoosh*. `` It's a wonder it ever works then.'' \n \n The fighting lasted about ten minutes. She started by throwing Kat at me, and moved on to the cushions shortly afterward. I counter-attacked with a standard tickle formation, but was blocked by the now airborne towel from the drying rack. \n \n Finally, we both calmed down, collapsing in mutal exhaustion by the fireplace. The gentle crackling warmth of the fire on one side, the firmer warmth of Sandra on the other. I supposed I could deal with this whole witchery thing, it would just take some thinking about. \n \n `` OK, then. We're going to need to sort this out. I'm sure we can think of something.'' \n \n `` I already have, Dave.'' Her voice was steady, and there was *something* in it. `` I really am sorry about this.'' \n \n `` *Eradicate Memory*!'' \n \n White sparks and then...... \n \n Sandra knelt beside the fireplace, about to put a new log on. The TV burbled in the background, something about a nature documentary. What had I been doing again? I was sure I was washing the dishes.... \n \n Sandra chucked the wood on the fire, as well as something else - a small paper that crisped and burned away. \n \n `` What was I doing again?'' I normally did n't have these lapses, but come to think of it, I had been having more and more of them lately. \n \n `` Tidying the hall closet, I think.'' \n \n `` Oh, thanks, babe.'' \n \n I got up and moved to the hall. Damned if I could remember *why* I'd decided to start with the big red suitcase.... \n\n"}

A mere tale. A mere story. A fantasy that'll never see the light of day where upon the gods of boredom and tediousness reign. \n \n \n But for a certain young, Mr. Daniels, things might not turn out as expected. \n \n \n For on one grim night, when Mr. Daniels was bored out of his mind, he plunged down into the basement of his newly purchased house, and retrieved an odd book.

But when he did, he completely forgot about his hand, and instead all of his attention was taken by the book. \n \n \n Blood-red. \n \n \n Dyed in the color of blood, the book he had retrieved looked like it had been formed from blood itself. \n \n \n He couldn \u2019 t tell down at the basement when he \u2019 d unwrapped it. But here in the bright, he could clearly see it. \n \n \n Red ripples appeared over the surface of the book, originating from where his right hand was connected to it. It was a book, a solid, yet at the same time, it was also liquid. But what was really strange was the fact that it did not feel wet to the touch. A little cold, yes. But nothing of the sensation one would expect when touching a liquid. \n \n \n As he was caught wondering to himself at this unusual sight, the pain suddenly returned. \n \n \n \u201c Ow! \u201d \n \n \n Immediately, he let go of the book as he closed his eyes and grabbed at his right hand. But he was too hasty, and before he could realize that the book did not actually leave his hand, his left had already gone for his right. With the book still at hand, as his left went for a grab, there was only one possible result: his left hand entered the blood-red book. \n \n \n As his left sunk into the book, Mr. Daniels was quickly alarmed. In his panic, he instinctively reached out for it with his right. And that too, sunk deep into the book. \n \n \n Immediately after, a scorching heat entered Mr. Daniels \u2019 body.

Professor Pavlis, head of the expedition and my graduate advisor, indulged me since I found the cave, cautioning me not to touch anything. \n \n The truth was, I could n't leave.

In a flash, the dragon was in front of me, blocking the entrance. The cave went dark, only the barest hint of light trickling past the lower ridges of the dragon's spinal osteoderms. \n \n `` Okay, okay,'' I said placatingly, holding my hands up, the problem-solving part of my brain overriding the lizard brain telling me to do something stupid and life-ending. `` What do I have to do?'' \n \n The dragon breathed fire over my head.

Not silent, persay, as living all the way up here gave a constant hum - the breathing sound that an old computer \u2019 s fan makes, albeit minutely louder - but relaxed. That sound was equivalent to silence for Candius. \n \n \n Of course for the pilot that went by the name of Angel, life was usually a little louder. He lived in one of the residential areas near the airport, as he usually spent his time down on earth. Angel hadn \u2019 t exactly been listening to his captain \u2019 s orders to stop doing so. The old geezer was wise, yes, but he worried all too often for a prodigy to want to listen to him. He had reasons - he didn \u2019 t want Angel to get hurt, or infected by V.I.S. \n \n \n Three hundred and twenty three years ago, a mutation strand virus - V.I.S - had begun. It made people violent and desperate for any type of blood whatsoever. It affected the brain \u2019 s limbic center, to be exact. They simply just didn \u2019 t care about any luxuries or pleasures anymore. They just spent all their time plotting for wars upon each other. Yes, they still had memories, they still had families. However, in the eyes of the infected, if people weren \u2019 t with them, they were against them. \n \n \n Yesterday, he \u2019 d been to earth to look for old relics and trinkets. He found them. Some old, weird device that operated like an AirScreen, but had a physical form and ran on a rechargeable, but short battery. An antique pocket watch, that now hung around his neck on a gold chain. Something the database he scanned his items in - something his captain had made himself, the tech genius, demanding \u201c If you \u2019 re going down there, I want to know what you find. \u201d - called a \u2018 pop can \u2019 and then listed other names for it ( soda, coke, whatever those meant ) among his more interesting finds. \n \n \n Boredly, he scrolled through news on his actual AirScreen. Another murder. He didn \u2019 t overly care, the culprit was caught. A ship crashed in the process of picking up a few supplies. Vague, of course. Politics. V.I.S remedy in process - interesting, probably a lie. Just lame, shitty stuff that was only mildly interesting. \n \n \n He definitely would have stayed down there for far longer, but he felt differently, oddly watched. That feeling made him get back onto his jet the second it washed over him. He hated feeling watched, and it had happened a couple times before down there. You didn \u2019 t want to be caught with someone who had V.I.S, because chances were, with the bloodborne virus, you \u2019 d catch it quick. The reason the captain hated going down to earth was because he \u2019 d watched his sister had the blood of one of them dripped into her mouth, many years ago. \n \n \n They were savages. \n \n \n His window and main source of light was obscured. ( He lived underneath the right air deck. The place costed him a fortune, but he made enough anyway. ) In a quiet, slow-motion horror, he turned his head to the side, watching as the thing ghosted past him. \n \n \n It was giant. It took up just pure *space*. The thing was greyish-blue in colour. The thing was, it was one of the Candius battleships. Instead, however, of the usually clean and polished look, it seemed gritty, covered in grime. The vector of Candius \u2019 airforce was slathered over with blood. Something had been scratched in over it, he realised, as it slid past where he was sitting. \n \n \n \u201c Shit. \u201d He pulled up his Captain \u2019 s information on the AirScreen and holo called him. After a couple of rings, Riley came into view. He was clearly wearing pajamas. If it \u2019 d been any other situation, Angel would have laughed. But he couldn \u2019 t summon any emotion rather than fear for himself and Candius. \n \n \n \u201c Angel, what the fuck? It \u2019 s five in the morning, today \u2019 s one of my vacation days.

He \u2019 d never expected those three letters to be so terrifying to him personally. It was never something he \u2019 d have to worry about, but it was happening.

Xxmasterassassinxx had entered the Entrance Hall of the castle without opening the door, just *jumping through it*, jumping backwards on the nearest ledge and with another jump up on the next level. \n \n I had seen this kind of behavior before. In all my years as the Main Guard in front of a room filled with collectibles, many players had left me standing there while killing all my friends who were guarding the fastest way to the top.

Let me tell you. All they care about is completing the game in the fastest way possible. Now you tell me, what do you think, what am I interested in? \u201d \n \n I was sure that my answer to this question was a big factor in what the boss had planned for me, so I wanted to get it right. This job was everything I had, and I could n't afford to lose it. He didn \u2019 t leave me any time to think about it, though. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ll tell you what I care about. Gold. Wealth.

One of selfishness, and maybe, somehow\u2026 loneliness. \n \n \u201c But, Sir\u2026 all of my comrades\u2026 they died, Sir. \u201d The boss seemed to have said everything he wanted to about the topic, but I wasn \u2019 t satisfied. \u201c Shouldn \u2019 t we do something about that? \u201d \n \n For a second a look of confusion flashed over his face, and then he just laughed. \n \u201c Well, of course we \u2019 ll do something about it.

I never drank tea before she came along, but that all changed when she made me a warm mug of... what was it... some sort of green? No, it was a purple hue. No, that ca n't be right... why ca n't I remember... \n \n At night sometimes, I lay awake and think of her. How it used to feel when she would curl up by my side. But lately my thoughts have been growing less and less vivid; I ca n't remember the smell of her shampoo, or the phrase we used to say to each other before we went to sleep.

How can that be?'' \n \n *Drink. * \n \n He raised his head, wondering at the voice. It was flat and distant sounding, the dulcet tones of a computer doing a self destruct countdown in a sci-fi show. He tried to reason with the voice why he should n't be drinking. The surrealism confused him, why would he drink, *how* can you drink when your insides are on the outside? The man began to giggle, a bubbling hysteria of mirth. \n \n *John, drink from the beaker. * \n \n `` I ca n't, I've no stomach,'' he began to cough, choking on his laughter. It should n't be funny to be a puddle but it was, some niggle at the back of his brain made him think he was a little insane, rational people do n't laugh at the unfortunate circumstances of disembowelment. \n \n *Are you pained, John?

It was n't a key I was familiar with and it was engraved with an `` E'', I put it in my pocket and forgot about it until today, until an hour ago when my mother had called me Ethan. My parents left to run an errand and now was my chance to finally see what was behind the door. We live in a three bedroom house, there's my parents room, my room and `` the third room'' across the hall from mine. It has always been locked, for as long as I can remember. \n \n I put the key in and turned the knob, the door squeaked like you would expect to hear in a movie. I stepped into the room. The air is stagnant and sunlight coming through the curtains of a small window throws little rays across the room. The first thing I notice is a poster of Cal Ripken Jr above a small bed, the bed has a baseball pillow with a mit laying beside it. I step further in and slowly spin around 360 degrees, that's when I saw him. There's a dresser in the corner of the room with a big mirror on it. Wedged along the border of the mirror are pictures of a young boy, my age probably but that's not what startles me the most. My heart is beating faster and faster as I approach the picture. There standing arm and arm on a baseball field is this young boy and me. We look identical. My head begins to spin as images began to pop in my head of this boy and I laughing as we play tag. I grab the dresser to steady myself as I look away from the mirror and the images begin to subside. My reprieve only lasts for as long as it takes to read the paper on the dresser before me.

There was so much going on, there was football to watch and videogames to play and it all seemed a bit too churchy for me. `` Ca n't you feel the vibration'' some of them said. Or `` it's the age of Aquarius'' the ones with long hair said. Or `` it's better than drugs'' my friends said. No one ever said `` it'll be like a nuclear explosion, but instead of buildings exploding we'll all just go'pop' and disappear, all at once''. I do n't know whether it was the blogs and books they started reading, their new age diet, maybe it was the WiFi 2.0. Everyone had just started getting along. No one cared about money any more. Political leaders seemed to genuinely be in it to help people instead of themselves, world hunger was a thing of the past. I suppose that's when I should have got on board with the programme. \n But it was like in school. When one bully fights with another you know that is not just because you're not cool that they're picking on you and you have no friends. They're just mean people. Well, when the bullies become nice and start getting on you've got no excuse. I did n't want to join them all because I knew I'd spoil it for everyone. I'm the bad apple. And they did n't seem to notice me abstaining from the daily love ins. Staying home and watching television until they switched it off. Then staying in and playing old videogames. It was n't like I was afraid it was a cult. It was so obviously genuine. So honest and loving. But I've been the bad apple in loving relationships before. Turned them sour and against me. I could n't risk doing that with everyone. Turning them all against me. \n It's ok now I suppose. I have everything I could ever have wanted. All the cars and food I could ever want. I own all the oil in the world. I guess I can never go on that helicopter ride I always wanted but nevermind. One thing's for sure, the wildlife is really taking over again. It's sort of beautiful in a post-apocalyptic sort of a way. \n So why am I blogging this? Why am I using what I can only guess are the last few days of electricity and internet to write down these thoughts that no one will ever read? Why am I not watching the last surviving bits of porn to remind me what touching someone was like? Well I do n't know. I just get a strange feeling that they're not gone. Not that I'm being watched or anything. Just that they're not gone. It's strange. It's like they're part of the wildlife now, part of the scenery in a way we were n't before. I miss them. But only their touch. I feel like they're still hanging around... in the air, in the water, in the clouds. I guess I'm writing this because I hope that they might read it and know that I'm honestly sorry. That they might read it and come back for...\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're walking through the forest when you find a basketball sized hole that seemingly has no bottom . You put your ear in the hole to listen and you hear what sounds like a million people screaming .\n","story":"The hole is faintly damp and smells of green, a good earthy scent like all the runoff from the grass and the bushes and the trees trickles down here, a neat little pit at the bottom of the world. The hole is dark, and cool, and cradles a human face almost perfectly, if they were to lie on their belly on the grass and feel it tickle their chest and their throat and stare down into the darkness. The inside of the hole looks like the inside of a womb, like the primordial state of existence before God created light. Sam likes to come here sometimes, when he can, and lie on his belly and look down into the dark and listen to the screams. \n \n The hole can swallow an arm up to the shoulder, and a little further than that, is all moist dirt against Sam's fingers as far down as he can reach. Sam's let both feet dangle down the hole, sliding down further and further until the hole hugs the bottom of his thighs, dreaming about the ground crumbling away under him, dreaming about slipping all the way in. It's a dumb dream, though. The hole swallows light, but Sam's shone a flashlight down it and seen the same even circumference going down as far as light can see. He'd considered digging, but it would ruin the neat exactness of the hole, and besides, he'd just be digging forever. As far as light can see. \n \n The leaves rustle and the cicadas chirp and the the birds sing, and the hole screams, soft and wavering and constant, as if from a million miles away. Sam ca n't hear it standing up, ca n't hear it squatting on his heels, ca n't hear it until he puts his head right up into the hole and *listens*. It's distant and warbling and faintly melodious, voices peaking up and dying, threading together, fading away. It's so hard to tell, because there are so, so many of them, but Sam's pretty sure it's people screaming, from a long, long distance away. There's a domed cathedral somewhere in the world where you whisper a word on one end of the dome, and the curve carries it all the way to a person with his ear pressed against the other side. That's what the hole does, Sam figures. It threads right down through the world, all the way to the other side, and it carries up the sound. \n \n Somewhere on the other side of the world, people must be screaming. There are faint, short bursts, and there are howls. There are things that sound like words, sometimes, in a language Sam does n't understand, things screamed in grief or fear or anger. There are the swooping screams of slide whistles, of things cutting through the air. There are screams fished out of the throat still raw and squirming, there are screams of men and women and children that cut off abruptly, and are overtaken by the chorus. There are screams of people dying. \n \n Sam's sent things back down the hole. He's dropped pebbles and lit matches, he's cupped his hands around his mouth and hollered back, listening for some response. He's dropped down handwritten notes, folded into tight paper squares that tumble down into the dark, he's dropped a cellphone down there and called the number again and again and had no one answer, up until the battery burnt out. He's poured water down there, he's dropped bagged sandwiches and canned goods and packs of jerky. He's let a flashlight fall. Once, he went a little crazy with spring cleaning and assembled the accumulated clutter of his life. Clothes he never wore anymore, books he did n't read, old CDs and DVDs, a long unopened bottle of cheap wine. He'd gathered old bath towels and faded bed sheets, half-empty bottles of lotion and aftershave and mouthwash, tacky gifts he'd been given over the years. And he'd hauled that all to the edge of the woods, up to the lip of the hole, and he'd spent the night there, feeding all his old junk into the hole one piece at a time, watching the redundant memories of his life go slipping down into the darkness. And the hole ate it all, swallowed it down without a sign, and all the while kept right on screaming. \n \n Nowadays Sam comes to the hole with his hands empty, that desperate impulse burnt out of him. The hole is there in summer and spring and winter and fall, constant as the seasons, dark and cool and patient and ceaselessly, ceaselessly screaming. And when it's not too wet and it's not too cold, he edges up to the hole on his knees and lies down on his belly and lets his head loll in, and stares down into a darkness more profound than his two closed eyes, and he waits there and he listens.\n"}

Echo defeated froze in regret and then turned swiftly and ran away. \n \n Crushed by shame echo ran home and retreated to her room. She laid under her blankets in complete darkness weeping about the encounter. As she grew older that experience always lingered in her mind and despite his actions she still thought fondly of Narcissus. She would wonder until her death what it would of been like if she had words to sway him with. Poetry or music to sing to him. \n \n Meanwhile, Narcissus dated around. He met another girl who was madly in love with him and after a time he broke her heart. He wandered home from school in a lethargic mood one day. Taking a broken path he meandered slowly with no real purpose. He though to himself how incredible he was. How good at games he was and how he would never find someone beautiful enough to compliment him. He locked himself in his room and began to pass the day away with video games. \n \n Day became night and Narcissus played video games until his hands hurt. He was transfixed on the screen and his only interest was only growing faster and stronger in the game to defeat the other online players. He pushed through weeks as he grew mad with conquest. He became obsessed and would spend all of his time with the game. Eventually, he grew sluggish and dirty. His other reflexes dulled and his charming glow slowly faded. \n \n Once echo played with him online and saw how powerful his character was. Upon seeing him at school she was shocked to see him in shambles. His demeanor had changed. His walk included a slouch and his mind was always on the game. He sat in a trance playing the game saying to himself \u201c Alas, another level. \u201d never quite ending his journey. Forever trapped within his own progress. \n \n Narcissus slowly wasted away consumed by his interest the game. One game soon led to another. He became a lonely programmer as he grew into adulthood. In seclusion he worked all of his life to develop a new game. His \u201c masterpiece \u201d game was released a day after his death and was entitled \u201d Narcissus \u201d. The adventure centered around a flawlessly handsome protagonist who levels up infinitely to never quite achieve his goal. The game was panned by critics and Narcissus faded into obscurity.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ TT ] You did n't realize just how blind you were until you went in and got prescription glasses ... Now you can see the leaves in the trees , the pebbles on the ground , and that your dog is actually a tiny dragon .\n","story":"I walk out of the eye doctor's office almost giddy with excitement. I can see - bricks on buildings, petals on flowers, the little light on my dashboard I'd been ignoring that apparently meant something was broken. Even the prospect of having work done on my car could n't dampen my mood. \n \n `` You're a grown adult,'' I chide myself. `` It's not like your glasses will make you see magical creatures.'' \n \n I marvel at how nice my house looked as I pull up in the driveway, but the thing I'm most excited to see is my puppy, Tiny. Tiny is, well, unusual. I adopted him when I bought my house to have someone to share the huge, empty space with. He'd been at the shelter for months, supposedly not adoptable. The ladies who worked there would cluck and shake their heads. `` He's just too funny-looking,'' everyone said. \n \n I'd taken him on the basis of his outcast status alone. I knew how it felt, and I needed him as much as he needed me. The poor guy would n't even come out of his pen the first time I saw him, hunkering behind the ratty dog bed as if he was scared that I too would shake my head at his appearance. We bonded after that, the two of us loners - the dog nobody wanted to adopt and the kid no one in the family wanted to deal with. \n \n Coming home to him is always my favorite part of the day. I do n't mind any of his quirks. For one, he is n't very soft or fluffy. More... almost bumpy. Poor guy probably has a skin condition. He's way smarter than other dogs, though - I swear he understands me when I talk to him. He's also learned how to open anything as fast as I can close it. Mostly, the little rascal goes in my drawers and takes my jewelry. He stashed it behind the mop in the closet and I do n't have the heart to take his little hoard away. I'm not sure how he got on top of the dresser, though. Or the fridge, or the bookshelf, for that matter. Last I heard, dogs ca n't climb, so I guess mine is talented. He also does n't bark. Well, he tries, but it comes out more like a cough. I started finding weird burn marks on my furniture, too, but I do n't see how Tiny could be doing that. \n \n Basically, Tiny means everything to me, and I ca n't wait to finally see my best friend clearly. I open the door and whistle, and the tap-tap-tap of little feet greet me as they always do. \n \n `` Tiny?'' Is this my dog? `` You - umm, are you okay?'' He has scales! And spikes! And, well, I'm not even sure he's a dog at all. `` Are you a dragon?'' \n \n Tiny's eyes widen in an almost-human expression of shock and hurt, and I feel horrible. `` I mean, I could n't ever see that well, but I did n't think I could have missed-'' \n \n He's gone, pattering down the hall as fast as his stubby legs carry him. I run after him, my voice cracking as I call his name. He must think I do n't want him any more, must feel like he's back at the shelter where people shake their heads and mumble about what a poor thing he is. \n \n He's curled up under my bed and I lay down so I'm at his eye level. My heart breaks as he shrinks farther into the shadows. \n \n `` Tiny, listen. I do n't care that you're a - a dragon. Frankly, it's pretty rad. You're my best friend, all right? I need you.'' \n \n It takes what feels like an eternity for the little dragon to inch his way toward me, as if he's hesitant to believe that I can see what he really is and it does n't matter to me. \n \n `` Tiny. I loved you as a dog, and I love you as a dragon, too. Really.'' \n \n I sit up as he crawls into my lap, curling up exactly as he always does. So that's where the burn marks come from, I realize with a chuckle. Tiny makes that funny coughing sound of his, and a little spark drifts up and fizzles out above my head. If dragons can smile, I think that's what mine is doing right now. \n \n As I sit with Tiny in my lap, I realize that for the first time since my mom screamed at me to pack my bags and get out, the four walls around me feel safe. Cozy, even. This is home, where my heart - and my dragon - are. \n \n ______________________________ \n If anyone wants to make this into one of those emotional humane society ads, go right ahead.

The IT department can help?.. you sure? \u2026 Al-right, I \u2019 ll coming over right now. \u201d \n \n *Snapping shut her phone, Alice began to walk down the path towards her car. Hmm.. what \u2019 s that? Oh! You wanted to know more about her phone? It \u2019 s just a very old flip model. \u2026 Probably. * \n \n > SCENE CHANGE - POLICE DEPARTMENT \n \n *Alice was frowning as she sat on the cushion chair across the table from Detective Brown. The way her legs crossed over each other lent a certain attractive vibe to the lower parts of her body. * \n \n \u201c And now he \u2019 s talking about my legs! This is harassment!! \u201d \n \n *Detective Brown looked like the kind of guy who was tired of hearing the same story for over a hundred times. Letting out a long sigh, he adjusted the square glasses on his nose and replied, * \n \n \u201c Ms. Bloomberg, we \u2019 ve been over this before. Due to reasons I don \u2019 t care about, you \u2019 ve become a central character in a story. That means an omniscient narrator is going to be around you, describing things you are upto. \u201d \n \n *The response did not please Alice who squeezed her left hand into a fist and slammed it over the detective \u2019 s table. * \n \n \u201c Omniscient or not, this guy can not be allowed to talk as if I don \u2019 t know he \u2019 s there! \u201d *she yelled, taking deep breaths. It caused her chest to move just enough for a ray of sunlight coming from the open window to illuminate the space between her breasts. * \n \n \u201c He just keeps talking about my body! This isn \u2019 t a story! It \u2019 s some weirdo with a sick fetish! \u201d \n \n *The detective wearily rubs his forehead wondering how this would lead to a homicide. Alice had told the police department that death would be coming - between the Police Chief personally investigating his favorite missing donut shop and Sebastian, his partner getting locked up for a minor case of eve-teasing ( or was it stripping? the handwriting was difficult to read\u2026 ) Ms.Bloomberg \u2019 s case ended up on his table. * \n \n \u201c Listen Miss, we already have restrictions in place to prevent the narrator from seeing you in your own home - it \u2019 s a private location. The law was on your side. But outside? We can \u2019 t restrict the guy from public areas. And besides, don \u2019 t you think it would be nice to become someone \u2019 s heroine? \u201d \n \n \u201c A heroine is fine. But not a fetish heroine!!! \u201d \n \n *Brown blinked a few times on hearing this. He wondered if there were other types of heroines, but on seeing the look on Alice \u2019 s face, he decided not to ask. Alice, deciding that the conversation was going too off-course, decided to bring it back on track by asking, * \n \n \u201c You said the IT department might be able to help. How can I contact them? \u201d \n \n *In response, Brown picked up the phone and dialed a number. He set the device on speaker to hear an irish voice saying, * \n \n \u201c Hello. This is IT. \u201d \n \n \u201c This is Detective Brown. I \u2019 ve got Ms. Bloomberg here with me having an omniscient issue. Can you please help her? \u201d \n \n \u201c Have you tried turning it off and on again? \u201d \n \n *Brown \u2019 s eyes lit up when he heard this. Terminating the phone connection he asked Alice, * \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s a good point. Have you tried that? \u201d \n \n *Alice looked at him as if he had grown a second head and was speaking nonsense ( which he most certainly was! ). * \n \n \u201c What? \u201d \n \n \u201c Have you tried turning the narrator off? Wait don \u2019 t answer that - just listen to me. According to the unwritten rules of the metaverse, if you \u2019 ve got a narrator following you around, that means he \u2019 s typing the story somewhere. Probably on a computer or laptop or something. And since you can hear his thoughts, you should also be able to access the browser windows on his computer. Just turn them off. \u201d \n \n \u201c This is the most ridiculous thing I \u2019 ve ever heard! \u201d *replied Alice, very, very, very clearly sure that this was an impossible idea, with no basis in fact or life and would never work. She instead raised her right hand high, to give us all a good view of her backside -* \n \n \u201c Like this? \u201d \n \n **THE END** \n \n -chronodekar \n \n\n"}

Empty promises and clever marketing. The mission certainly was n't the first of its kind, the men before him would attest to that if they could. It was simply the first mission ever mentioned to the public. What set Richard apart was that his mission was a return mission.

At some point everyone developed a fascination with manned journeys, as if it was some larger accomplishment, sealing the fate of many young men. \n \n The destination light began to blink, telling him that it was almost over. He could n't remember the last time he looked out the window, and figured now would be a good time. He looked out only to see the utter void of space. No light to be seen in any direction. Only the light of his window seen from the outside, a firefly gliding through the night. He felt immense calm rush over him. Finally, it was over. \n \n The return flight switch blinked at him, breaking his fascination for just a moment.

My feet continue their pacing readily making sure not to miss a beat in the rhythm. Apprehension starts to well in my chest, leaving little room for my breaths. I dig my feet into tiles willing myself to cut milliseconds off my turnover to make ground on the thing. I was eating my legs up, but it was worth it -- I needed to get to the end of the white path as soon as possible. Suddenly, the white path started to get narrower and narrower revealing the dark abyss that awaited me if I missed a step. I focus harder, gluing my eyes to the available white that I needed to make my step, carefully planting my feet directly in front of me to ensure that I do n't fall. Out of the corner of my eye, directly ahead of me was a yellow light. It was the haven. Now that I had the end in mind, I dash madly toward the light. I exert myself to the maximum possible extent, leaving no breath for me to breathe, no feelings in my legs to spare, and no arms to wildly swing. The white path was ending, which only ensured me I was going to be safe soon. The yellow light reached out to me while my legs start to buckle, but I push them trying to make it to the light, where safety awaited. The yellow gets brighter and brighter, as I dig my feet into the ground deeper and deeper, relinquishing all focus that I held previously.

What once had a purpose, now has none at all. What once meant so much, now meant so little. The world had lost it's color, only filled with black and white and no other. If I was happy, I was not happy, I was incredulously ecstatic; If I was sad, I was not sad, I was grievously wounded; If I was angry, I was not angry, I was furiously vexed.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Death has a child with a Guardian angel . Tell his or her story .\n","story":"Death sighed, pulling his robes over his hands. He did n't like being so exposed in a place like this. The thin skin stretched over his fingers made a scraping sound as he clenched one hand into a fist. He could hear the laughter and strum of harps nearby. Bees buzzed around gardenias and chrysanthemums that rose up high around him, and each stretched out to reach for the sun's light. Death reached out and plucked a nearby carnation, holding it to his thin cold lips and twirling it around. He had dreaded coming here all day, dreading that he would be the cause of the quietness and reverence. The garden was always so much more enjoyable with the laughter, with the smiles, with the... *The life, * he thought bitterly. It made no difference, it was what would have to be done. What if there was another way? But he knew there was n't. \n \n Death sighed again and laid his scythe down on the cobblestone, feeling over its thin and warped staff as he continued on his way down the pathway. Over the hedge he could see the girls, all of them giggling and playing in the flowers, looking up to Giselle for guidance. It was certain her beauty would never fade, long trailing golden hair falling over her shoulders and back in locks, and soft wings laid aside, the corners fluttering every time she laughed. Death smiled to see it. At least she was laughing, even if they both knew it would be short lived. \n \n `` Peter keeps putting himself in trouble,'' Elise complained, putting her harp aside and rolling onto her stomach. The small angel's wings spread out onto the grass. \n \n `` Peter does that too?'' Rosie exclaimed, looking over to Elise. `` Lidia wo n't stop! She wandered off by herself the other day, and I was flying all over the place trying to pull away thorn bushes, shoo away the animals, I even had to push a badger back into his den. Look what he did!'' Rosie sat up straight and held out the tip of her wing for the others to see. Feathers were missing, scratched away, or crumpled and ripped. Elise gasped. \n \n `` Now, now,'' Giselle laughed, and lowered Rosie's hand, `` no need to fuss. Yours are both very young, they will grow wise in time. But for now, you two must guide them and keep them from harm's way.'' Both of the little ones smiled bashfully, and went back to their playing. Giselle followed their smile, and pulled Josephine into her lap. \n \n *The girl will have her mother's beauty one day, * Death thought with a smile, *Maybe even more, * She had her mother's hair, with more of a reddish tint. Giselle would laugh and say it was because she would play in so many roses. Death laughed at the thought, but remembered what was to happen, and his smile faded. \n \n `` You're so lucky you do n't have to fly around and be a guardian to anyone else,'' Rosie continued, `` You just have to watch after Josephine.'' \n \n `` Yes, I am very lucky.'' Giselle smiled and pulled her daughter onto her lap. Death could see that her smile was forced. The flowers bent aside as he walked through to the small clearing of grass that was secluded in the garden. Elise and Rosie froze, and looked to Giselle for guidance. She gave a smile and turning to them, spoke, `` You two go on, I'll join you later.'' Both girls reluctantly obeyed, giving Josephine and Giselle their last goodbyes. `` Bye, Giselle.'' \n \n `` Yes, goodbye Giselle. Will you teach us the next song tomorrow? \n \n `` Yes, I can teach you two tomorrow.'' \n \n `` Okay,'' and they went. Death was acutely aware of their eyes on him. \n \n `` So it appears they're getting on well enough,'' he began. Death sat down next to Giselle, and offered her the carnation he had plucked. She did n't answer him, but smiled sadly and took the carnation. In her lap Josephine squirmed up to a sitting position and reached out for the flower, taking it from her mother and clutching onto the stem tightly. \n \n `` Why does it always have to be this way?'' Giselle whispered. \n \n This was what he had been fearing all day long. He felt his heart sink. `` You know why. We both made that choice.'' She acknowledged his words with silence. `` It wo n't be all bad. The other two are already on their way to getting their wings. You can see them again then,'' Death comforted. \n \n It was a vain attempt, and Giselle's wings folded up along her back with agitation. `` And how long has it been since I've seen either of them? You said the same thing each time.'' \n \n *Too long. It's been too long. * Death sighed and wrapped an arm around Giselle, her hair soft under his arm as he looked down at the girl. She had his dark eyes, and full dark eyelashes to pair with them. Josephine reached up to take his hand and he forced himself to pull away before she could touch him. That had been the worst curse of it, not being able to touch them at all. For no tiny fists to clench his thumb, no slobbery kisses, not even being able to hold them. `` Death is not the worst thing that people endure,'' he said, pointing the comment to Giselle, when really saying it to himself. \n \n Giselle saw Death's cautious movements and pulled the babe away, and laid her down on the grass. It did little to stop the girl from rolling around again and climbing onto her hands and knees. A butterfly landed on the daisy in front of her, making her eyes go wide. `` Life is given to us for a reason,'' she insisted, `` it's unfair to take it away so quickly. She's so small...'' Her voice broke. Death felt a knot tighten in his throat. \n \n `` It's how it is,'' he said plainly. \n \n Josephine was giggling now; the butterfly had landed on her nose. The sun shone through the monarch's wings and cast the girl's face the same color as her hair. Giselle watched and wiped the tears that had spilled out of the corners of her eyes. `` I ca n't do it again,'' she whispered, `` not anymore. I ca n't bear it.'' Death had known it would eventually come to this, so all he did was hang his head and nod slowly. \n \n They sat there in the sun for as long as they could afford, watching the babe sit and entertain herself with the flowers and small creatures around the garden. Even a thrush came to say hello at some point, and opened its beak to serenade the three of them. When it was done with its song, Death stood. `` Come, let's do it now.'' \n \n Giselle followed suit and stood as well, tears cascading down her face, and she lifted her daughter up to her feet. Death walked away a few paces, then crouched down. He watched Josephine giggle as her mother held her hands tight and helped her to stand. `` Go on, Josie. Go to Papa.'' Josephine smiled and took a step forward. Death outstretched his arms. A few more steps with her mother's guidance, and the girl laughed, her pace quickening. Giselle let go with a small cry, a smile only on the corner of her lips. Death's mind screamed at him to pull away, but he could n't. He *wanted* to hold her, if only once. Josephine walked straight into his arms with a smile. And Death held her, pulling his suddenly limp daughter close to his chest. The summer sun had warmed her skin. She was warmer than his first two children; it had been winter for the both of them when they took their first steps. He knew she would n't stay this warm for much longer, so he savored the few moments in silence. \n \n He grew thankful for the large hood over his head, because it concealed the tears that rolled down his cheeks and blurred his vision. He saw Giselle move, but was n't sure of what she was doing. She had probably turned away. After the silence had grown to be too much, and the tears subsided for both of them, Death shifted Josephine into one arm, and kissed Giselle's cheek. She did n't mind his cold and dead lips. `` It wo n't be long,'' he whispered. \n \n `` In an eternity, anyway,'' she replied. \n \n Death realized there was n't any point in pushing further. He found Giselle's hand and squeezed it softly. `` I'll make sure she's taken care of.'' He turned away, and pushed his way through the flowers again, holding his daughter close and kissing the top of her head. \n \n ( I'm sorry for bad quality, I'm pushing my way through writer's block. And I am more than happy for critique. )\n"}

In having `` anarchy'' but world peace, would mean that the governments were united and that the only unrest came from the people. So no wars but there were riots.

He woke up, turned the TV on, and caught a bit of the local news. \n \n `` Good morning Arnaville! In local news, more home burglaries in the Candish area. Please remember to lock your doors and be vigilant for any suspicious activity. Here are five sketches and screen stills created from video surveillance in victim's homes. If you recognize any of these people, please call the police department's number which is on-screen.'' \n \n Jerin smiled and thought to himself, `` Ha, 5 individuals shown, and there of the pictures are me. I guess my simple disguises are working well.'' \n \n He put his headphones in and left for his jog. He did n't always take the same route as he used it as part of casing good prospects, but he always passed through the same area of his neighborhood on the way out. Of course, he ruled out any of these homes for working, but he always noticed that one home in particular was especially enticing. No visual security implementation, 1960's design, and of course, no dogs. He had never even seen the owner and assumed it must have been a part-time home for someone. Maybe it was a parent's home who's in a nursing home now. The draw of the home was a visible set of jewelry not at all obvious to anyone except a trained eye. Through the thinning bushes of winter on the first floor's bedroom they were visible through bay windows. Jerin had grown confident in his abilities, and decided he could bend his own rule. Tonight, he was taking an easy hit. \n \n Making his way home after the rest of a regular jog, he formulated a simple plan of entry. He let himself into his home and took a nap. \n \n -- - \n \n 14 hours, a few meals, and a movie later, Jerin put his face on and left for his solo job. \n \n Her arrived at the house in the same exact condition he had seen it every other day. Regardless to the obvious lack of any presence, he stayed routine in his precaution as it had become second nature. He surveilled the surrounding area and surreptitiously moved the the back side of the house where he pulled out his lockpicking kit and quickly made work of the back door. \n \n He was in the kitchen. It was nondescript with nothing of note, and he continued to make his way to the bedroom with his silent footfalls in handmade supple leather shoes. Everything was going so easily. The door to the room was open, and he found the jewelry presenting a necklace of pearl on top. \n \n He put his hands, which were cloaked in thin cloth gloves, on the necklace but could immediately tell they were fake. He opened the box, and it was filled with plastic trash imitation jewelry. Usually imitation jewelry was not presented in such a way of pride, so Jerin was a bit shocked by this. \n \n Having already changed up his routine a bit, he decided he felt a bit confident and was going to do a quick check for anything else of value in the home. He was sure no one was here, and if there was anything he had learned about the generation that bought and lived in homes kept in this traditional way, it was that they hide their jewelry in the closet, so he walked to the nearby walk-in. \n \n Upon opening the door, Jerin sees that it's actually a staircase leading up. Intrigued, he silently crept up until his head peered just over the floor of the room. It was dark up here, but he could discern that the room was an art studio of some sort filled with canvases. Almost certainly there was nothing of value, but seeing as no one was around and the nearby cot was empty, he produced his compact flashlight and clicked it on to scan the area. \n \n Jerin froze. Of about 50 visible canvases, he was on all of them. Many of him jogging... many of him at home... and many of him at work. \n \n\n"}

It's all changed, gone down the shitter.'' \n The bird pitched hard right. Liska's straps bit into the body. Cunning moaned. \n Fuck me. And fuck Worthington too. \n The bird was under fire. Drechna was pissed off. \n Their Ground Commander called out, `` Fuck what you hear. Listen up! We are about to touch down. You know your shit, nows the time. Break out, squads form, postitions, find the shit, and eat up!'' \n The bird plummeted. Cunning lost his gut, green vomit hit Gunner feet across the way. The GC shouted, `` And do n't be a pussy like Cunting over their.'' \n \n The bird touched down after all. \n Buckles came off, guns were locked and loaded. Looks like I made the tele after all. Mom would be proud. \n The pilot called out, `` Get the fuck off my bird! You have a load of heathen shit heading this way!'' \n The GC started screaming commands. They filed out of the Hellfly, left and right side. Liska was three deep from his exit and could see the nearest sun's light bursting in as the doorway opened. The light was mixed with red. \n Except it was n't a sun. Those heathen shits were lobbing some kind of light at the Hellfly's exit. The red was blood exploding from greenies. \n The GC barked, `` Left exit, defend this fucking bird! Fuck exiting, buckle down and give hell! Those in rear, turn round and exit opposite. MOVE MOVE MOVE FUCKING MOVE!'' \n Liska ran forward, crouching and began firing. Everything was sandy yellow. Deciduous growth, but the trees were n't green like he'd seen in film. Closest thing to the home I've never seen. And I am here to take it. Too bad I ca n't keep it. \n He was n't seeing any shits. Just firing. He'd seen holos of them, but that adds up to shit when your gun is rumbling and you know you are about to be touched by a death-light. \n Sun bursts kept pounding the hull of the Hellfly. Liska focused, found where they came from and lit it up on those positions. \n Faint yelps and screams sounded. Liska smiled, `` Focus fire at the base of the trees at 11 and 3 o'clock. They got camp!'' \n A greenie responded behind him, `` No shit, Pill! Let me work.'' \n Fire rained, metal and sun. Suddenly more metal entered the fray. The right exit had come about. \n Three were left, then one, and then the sunbursts faded. \n `` Fuck me,'' Cunning sighed, looking down, `` They blew near ten of us away! With goddamn sunshine and rainbows!'' \n Nearby Gonnel chuckled, `` Rainbows, huh? You watch too many history docs, Cunting.'' \n `` Shut your face, fuckface.'' \n `` Clever.'' \n They stepped off the bird. Liska turned, `` Why did n't the pilot pull out of this?'' \n `` He ai n't gunna be pulling much out of anything, dead,'' Wittel said coming from the cockpit. \n Neither are we any time soon. \n The GC came into view, `` Squads! Find your Head and do your shit. We have pay to earn.'' \n Liska and Cunning turned to Wittel. He was Twelves Squad Head, and a damn competent one at that. Should be GC, ask me. No one does though, no shits given either. \n Wittel looked about, `` Three of us down. Dunn, Bristo, and Fisk. Put on the bird. Sad fucks, first chance at daylight and it kills them.'' Not too inspiring sometimes though. \n Wittel continued, `` The rest of you, let's hit those trees, see what's left. Ahmad, Surviner, and Liska are tri-point. I want eyes and ears out hard. We do n't know this shithole, best start learning. Let's go.'' \n Liska heading forward, Cunning winked at him. `` Suck my dick, Cunning.'' \n `` You know it, Gunner Pill.'' \n Liska took left point, jogging ahead and heading for the trees at 11. He reached the first tree and put his back to it. The damn thing fell over and he followed suit. Shit. \n He rolled and hit a rock. The rock moved. Shit again! He jumped up and leveled his weapon. \n The shit was face down, obviously dead. Half a man's height it could n't have weighed more than 20 kilos. \n The thing was wrapped in sandy garb. It had some kind of turban wrapped about its head. \n He turned about. His squad was approaching and Wittel was advancing to him. Looking on the shit, Wittel stood from faced, `` Drechnan. The holos the Bosses gave us only showed them in this garb. They said they were similar to humans. Alarmingly so.'' \n He paused. Then looked at Liska, `` Take a look Gunner.'' \n Liska instantly crouched, dropped his weapon, eager. Let's see the fucks. \n He grabbed the headdress and tore hard. The fabric pulled the head and coming away it smacked the ground with, the face looking nowhere and everywhere. Right into my soul. \n A child's face, as sandy as the trees and dust looked across where Liska had just come. \n We came to take. So much. \n `` Wittel..'' \n Wittel's face did n't falter, `` Command said we would be facing a race of humanoids with the likeness of children, but with the minds of full grow. Adults. They claim we share nothing more than appearance. As you can see, they have no blood, but are... powered by their atmosphere alone, which for some reason skips liquids, the necessity inherent to humans.'' \n Liska could n't breath. He was trapped in an unending second, only measured by a word. \n Killing is no easy task when faced against another human. In order to kill another, one must remove the others humanity. By dehumanizing, demonizing the other, we can easily kill. Look at history. Religious beliefs allowed my people to say `` They do not believe and are thus'less'. As a result they are not human as we are.'' The poison of race that had plagued humanity for millennia was the same. All of these driven by anger. I believed it would be so simple, so easy with something absolutely inhuman... \n `` Liska we need to get in formation. Gunner, get up. Get up!'' He reached for his weapon, rose, and stumbled into the foreign hell.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You posted a prompt , but it was downvoted . Your faith in humanity is waning .\n","story":"The big empty character glowed mockingly on Riley's screen. Another prompt downvoted to hell. Maybe someone was trolling her, hunting her specifically just to cause her even more pain. `` Well good for them.'' The sound of her own voice surprised her. It did n't sound like her voice, not how she remembered it. Did she always sound like a barrel of gravel grinding through sand? \n \n Distantly, Riley heard her father's hands slam on the kitchen table. At least it was the kitchen table this time. Better the table than her door. \n \n A few quick clicks brought her back to the new prompt submission page. It really did n't matter to her how many downvotes her posts got, she had to try again. Someone would reply eventually. She was n't even sure why it mattered so much to her. Ever since she found \/r\/WritingPrompts, she dreamed of having a front page prompt -- a prompt with a hundred stories on it for her to read. And she would read every last one. She had tried reading the stories for other popular prompts, but it just was n't the same. They were n't written for her. She had to try again. \n \n Riley had only managed to type `` [ WP ]'' into the text box when she heard him. His weight on the steps caused them to creak like an old barn door. He never tried to mask it either, even when Riley was sleeping. The creaking was slow and painful as if her father was slowly crushing a baby bird with each step. He was n't rushing, bad sign. She only had a few seconds. Riley's fingers flew across the keyboard. \n \n `` Riley!'' Her father's voice boomed through the door as if it was made of paper. She did n't even have to smell her father's breath to know that the alcohol was there. When she did n't answer a huge hand slammed into Riley's door. `` RILEY! Get yer ass out here.'' He'd try the handle next. She had started locked the door now. He would n't like that. Riley kept typing. Cursing a typo, she backspaced about half of what she wrote. She had to finish this. This one would be it. Nothing else would matter once she had her story. Just one reply. \n \n The doorknob jiggled. `` You...'' her father's voice sounded confused at first, `` YOU B**** DO N'T YOU EVER DARE TO LOCK YOUR DOOR ON ME.'' Tears were streaming down Riley's face as she typed the last couple words into the prompt. \n \n `` A period. You need a period, stupid.'' She was talking to herself again. She did n't care. A colossal crack shook the air and Riley's door flew off its hinges. Splinters flew everywhere falling like sharp needles against Riley's back. Her father's hulking figure stood silhouetted in the wan light of the hallway. Riley's hand flew to the mouse as he stalked toward her. The alcohol that she knew would be there permeated the air with his every breath. His hand enclosed her wrist like a vice. `` Yer coming with me RIGHT NOW.'' \n \n `` Ow! Stop! Father, please.'' One hand was all she needed, one second was all she wanted. Just as the mouse hovered over the submit button he pulled. Her hand slipped. Did it click? Riley was n't sure. `` NOOOOOOOO, father no, please stop!'' He ignored her, dragging her frantically sobbing from the room like a disobedient dog. As her sobs faded with the creaking of the stairs, Riley's computer screen lit up and changed. When it resolved, there was a single new empty thread. A writing prompt titled, `` [ WP ] A father knocks on his daughter's door with a surprise.''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Guns have been outlawed Worldwide because they are viewed as a cowardice form of war . Only short range weapons ( Swords , arrows , spears , etc ) are legal for countries to possess .\n","story":"His ears filled with the sound of the engine, he looked up as Lieutenant Godfrey stood and bellowed over the noise: \n \n `` Right, you lot, you know what we're doing. You'll be safe on the way down, but mind arrows from about a hundred feet, we do n't know if there's anyone in the area but they'll have seen us and are on their way. Once down there we regroup at the Hockdow bridge at oh-three-hundred hours, anyone who's late, try to follow us to the town. Good luck.'' \n \n Rogers and the others nodded, and continued their private thoughts. This was the first time he'd gone into battle without a gun, he felt oddly naked, even the sword by his side lacked a reassuring weight, having been designed for paradrops. He, and the others, were all equipped with such swords, and small compound bows which might be useful, not enough action had occurred in the new modern era where guns were banned and swords and bows were the norm. This was an experiment as much as it was an operation. \n \n The red light above them blinked on, Rogers got up with his squadmates and hooked themselves onto the rail overhead. At Godfrey's order he checked the parachute of the man in front and yelled it was OK. A minute later, the rear ramp descended and the light blinked to green. \n \n `` Go! Go! Go!'' \n \n One after the other, like some rollercoaster, they leaped out of the back of the aeroplane, any shouts masked by the sound of the engine. They descended through the air, Rogers pulled his cord and FLOOM, he had a parachute. Well, that's a relief, he thought. \n \n As he slowly wafted through the air towards the dark, forbidding countryside below him, he thought of what it must have been like for those who did the same on D-Day, a hundred years ago. Much the same as this, probably, though the sky would have been alight with gunfire and explosions and all sorts. Nowadays aeroplanes flew with impunity everywhere ( apart from North and South Korea ) with no risk of being shot down. The night was silent now, the aeroplane had rumbled off into the distance. \n \n The ground reached up to meet his feet, he hit the ground hard, but got up immediately, nothing had broken. He unhitched his parachute, readjusted his helmet, pulled it's visor down, and went off through the cornfields, checking his compass by the nifty nightvision goggles. He was accompanied by nothing but the rustle of the crops and the trees in the forest to one side, a few sounds that might be his squadmates in that direction. \n \n Orders were to meet at a small farm half a mile away, where they'd then all move off to the nearby town to blow the bridge. While guns were banned, explosives definitely were n't. He decided to go straight east to the village, if those noises were those of his squadmates then he'll meet up with them soon enough. No point in diverting. \n \n Some minutes later, skirting around a field, he heard a scream in the distance. A clash of metal. Another scream, then, silence. While looking around, he was suddenly blinded by a flare that shot up from over a rise in the ground, illuminating the countryside for miles around. Dull thunks told him he was being shot at by arrows. Thinking on the spot, he dived into a ditch and drew his sword. He had cover here, he could creep forward to the cover of some trees and hopefully do some damage there. \n \n This plan was put on hold by shouts and cheers, a group of people were running towards him across the field from beyond where the goggles could see, brandishing their own, heavier, swords and a few axes. \n \n There was no way he could handle all of them. \n \n Shouting, he stood up with his hands raised, trying to make it clear he was surrendering. But the men did n't seem to have heard, as they reached him, they swung their weapons. He parried and deflected as best he could, but there were too many. An axe in his side, he collapsed, unbearable agony coursing through him, and his last thought before eternal peace was that is was easier to surrender when everyone had guns and were n't rushing at each other...\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Reddit finally secured funding to build a vast metropolis in its likeness . It is broken up into boroughs and cities , which represent subreddits . Every aspect of this mega city has been designed specifically to cater to and sustain millions of redditors . Describe your experiences here .\n","story":"In the beginning it went well enough. A large supercomputer in the central citadel was maintained by \/r\/science, \/r\/programming, \/r\/engineering and others like them who kept their dwellings close to the computer. The subs created OC like never before, and many said that the Reddit Republic was the first utopia, with food and peace for any and all. That lasted 11 years. An error in the supercomputer controlling Reddit's infrastructure and state-wide WiFi caused it to shut down and close off the massive gates in the walls that served as the borders of Reddit. While many believed outside help would come, too late had we discovered that the outside world had been destroyed by the insidious viles of Tumblr, causing a societal collapse outside of our glorious city-state mere days before the error in the machine. \n \n It was chaos. The Reddit-Megalopolis was in a state of pure insanity. Putting so many people together and dividing them into sections based on their favorite subreddit did not work well after the incident. The Subreddits were organized after how they were. \/r\/funny for example was gray, boring and repetitive with next to nothing of entertainment or joy. 20 years after the incident, and people have gone fairly native and tribal. \n \n Close to the central citadel, \/r\/writingprompts, \/r\/books, \/r\/writing and several other writing based subreddits had been forced into one huge nonsensical library with twists and turns and special rooms filled with crazy stories and the madness of deranged authors. Few dared to enter the labyrinthine mass that was the greatest library in the modern age, unless they be lost to the knowledge and stories hidden inside. Tribes of writers and authors grew plants and hunted for animals that escaped from the north sections in between the works of Shakespeare and Stephen King, teaching their children about the importance of proper grammar and sentence structure alongside basic survival skills. \n \n In the eastern section were where the seedier and more risque subreddits were built. Ranging from good old fashioned''gonewild'' to subreddits catering to the most dark and depraved fetisches unimaginable, they were n't really safe, with a city of whores and perverts roaming the streets in search of fresh porn and new desires. It was the first place to fall, worshiping darker gods of flesh and desire, they soon started raiding each other for slaves and sacrifices. In the center of their depraved lands stood a mighty temple dedicated to the glory of Slaanesh, smeared with the blood and sexual juices of innocents and damned alike. The strongest of states is now called Pornographia, the home of the self-proclaimed Empress of Reddit, and her brood, planning to capture a scientist to teach her the secrets of gunpowder and use it to conquer the Central section to cement her claim as the Empress of all the Reddit. \n \n The north was dedicated to the sweet and sickening, kittens, bunnies and puppies galore, yet little else but pets and play. When the food stopped being delivered for free since transportation quickly broke down after being destroyed by some of \/r\/anarchy s greatest terrorists. Soon people begun to eye the pets of others with hunger and fights broke out between the major groups. First it was over which pets should be killed and eaten, then it degraded into all-out war over time. The dog-clans and the cat-tribes eventually became the dominant cultures in those areas over the course of a few years. Other smaller cultures that had fled the vast civil war now eke out a pitiful existence near the northern gate, barely surviving on their own. While primitive agriculture had been developed, cannibalism was still a thing, as during those long hard times when food was scarce, neither wanted to go hungry or eat their pets. They worshiped the animals that they once only adored. The dog-clans had a more decentralized spiritual system of spirit-sharing between man and canine while the cat-tribes worshiped a number of god-cats ranging from the ancient Egyptian cat goddess Bastet, goddess of fertility to the more modern Grumpy Cat, goddess of war and irritation. The tribes were led by a number of cat-priests, who ensured the will of the cats would be fulfilled by the tribals. The dog-clans were modeled after how wolves in nature organize groups, led by the strongest known as the Alpha, they fought the cats long and hard in the ruinous north. \n \n I could continue if someone were inclined for that?\n"}

Still a bit blurry but he seems to be leaning on something. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` wha... what..'' is all he can muster at first, the feeling of exhaustion slowly leaving him. Giving a couple hard blinks he lazily focuses, `` where am.. I..'' he says as he reaches out to what he's leaning on. It feels like stone, *What else would it be in a cave? * Stiorn thought to himself. Focusing a bit more, he see's it clearly. Yes indeed it's a stone alright. \n & nbsp; \n \n It's a stalagmite, going directly through his chest. \n & nbsp; \n \n ``..oh.. Oh god!'' Stiorn exclaims while grabbing for the spike, `` That bastard really kicked me off the cliff!'' \n & nbsp; \n \n Frantically grasping the stalagmite Stiorn gets to his feet while still pierced by the thing, hunching over it. He gives a few grunts and tugs but to no avail. Looking around a bit, he see's what the wet feeling was now. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Man my blood is all over my cloths. Zwecklings below...'' he cursed, `` I hope I do n't get a disease from all this.. dirt and grime going into me.'' \n & nbsp; \n \n The blood that had most likely pooled around his feet and the stone were now slowly oozing back to where it came from. Even the splashes that stained his clothing have mostly been receded out and flowed towards the wound. \n & nbsp; \n \n Stiorn had never seen such magical actions before, and while he was transfixed by such an amazing thing he heard a chuckle from behind. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Young one I told you not to be peeking on those men, they seemed pretty dangerous.'' said the tiny floating man. He flew over with his small wings to the spike and leaned against it with an outstretched arm, scratching his bald head with the other. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Ay-yol's love... You sure got stuck mighty bad. And while you were sleeping the deep-dark those men you spied on have taken stick an' stone to your village.'' \n & nbsp; \n \n `` What!? Then help me off this thing Gord!'' Stiorn yelled and then kept pulling and tugging trying to remove himself from the spike. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` You did n't listen at all when I was explaining what it meant to be *Divine and Protected* did you? I ca n't interact with this plane of existence, I am here to feed you my energy. That's all.'' Gord said while moving off the spike, zipping around Stiorn and landing on his back. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Though if I can give a pointer, remember that thing I taught you about focusing the energy you're receiving?'' he said, now sitting cross legged on Stiorn's back. \n & nbsp; \n \n Stiorn gave an aggravated look, `` Yeah, but you told me that I have n't been *Divine* long enough to use it, ya know, hence the whole being kicked down a pit and impaled by a rock you dumb Fairy!'' he yelled and gave another pull trying to get off the stalagmite but to no avail. \n & nbsp; \n \n Gord gave a slightly annoyed look and rolled his eyes, `` I'm an Ay-yol Pixie thank you. Any way, well you've been dead- er, taking a nap down here for a while. Try it now like we practiced on the spike.'' \n & nbsp; \n \n Stopping his efforts to remove himself from the stone, he looked down towards his hands. But before focusing on the energy he noticed that all his blood had returned from their wounds. Ignoring the magic for now, he closed his eyes and began to focus. There, slowly but surely it was like from his practice. But then suddenly there was a lot more. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Woah, I feel it... It's way more than before! How long have I-'' Stiorn cut off, `` No time, got ta hurry.'' and with that he clasped his hands around the stalagmite. His hands were softly glowing and before long they were bright like a flame. \n & nbsp; \n \n `` Good young one, you learn fast. Now.. Release it!'' Gord instructed. \n & nbsp; \n \n Stiorn groaned for a moment, and then there was a quick flash of light... \n And then the stone was gone! `` Alright!'' Stiorn cheered, standing up straight. He turned towards Gord who was now hovering beside him. `` Now, lets climb this cliff and get out of this cave so we can help the village!'' \n & nbsp; \n \n As Stiorn turned and ran off towards the cliff side Gord dodged away from Stiorns back, `` Uh, Young one...'' he said trying to hold in a laugh, `` I think you missed something...'' \n & nbsp; \n \n The blast had only removed the stone where his hands had been, leaving the stone still stabbed through and dangerously swaying around from his back.\n"}

The fireplace is okay too, but between the open fire, the too-thick smoking jacket, and the throw blanket in my lap, I'm almost sweating.

What a stupid idea. And of course she was called a witch, and of course she was bullied. Aggy was a stupid nickname. But There were n't any good nicknames that were to obvious, so her fellow students called her Aggy. Aggy wanted to be a scientist and an astronaut and a cat and president. Aggy was beautiful, for someone from the country. Aggy was intelligent even for someone from the city, but above all: Aggy was kind. After all if you look into the mouth of the biggest evil in the history of the known universe: teenage kids, all you could take away from it was kindness. Kindness is a mushroom that grows in the desert at night. That and a few traumata involving several dozen rats and an oversized pencil. But now she was 21. And she left that behind her. \n \n Aggy has had lesbian experiences. Aggy has had sexual relationships. Aggy did her own taxes twice a year and hated it, and Aggy jobbed in a train station flower shop on the weekends. Is was this flowershop where she met Vincent. they smiled at each other, like people do when they want to fall in love. They never really did. But they did other things. and the world was filled with gravy and pudding bags of shit. In the end they split with a crack and heavy breathing. There was another woman. She was better looking. And cooler. And, to Aggys dismay, a wonderful person. Aggy cried. She did not know if Vincent cried. She wondered about that a lot. \n \n When she finished College she wanted to travel, but then she met Sophia, who bought Lavender. And Sophia was glorious and witty and could do things with her hands, other people needed a screwdriver and two electric milk frothers for. She did n't travel. She moved in with Sophia. And it was wonderful. Sophia died when she was 27. She was killed by a fanatic who called her a fag and then shot her. Aggy always made sure to smell of Lavender, to remind people of Sophia. And it only made her more careful and kind, she knew that carrying on was important. The desperate die. The kind live. And every life is a life worth living. And the Flowers she tended only got brighter after that. \n \n The recession came, of course. And because of a bad investment her Boss lost the flowershop. Agnes Butterbloom had saved some money. And maybe the universe was telling her to travel now. She left for Japan only two months later. And Aggy saw Cherry Blossoms and Japanese Gardens, and she got bad food poisoning and had to go home three days later. Such is life, she thought. If the sauce is bad it does n't matter how good the potatoes are. \n \n But she got money leftover. And property was cheap. She wanted to buy a flower shop. And on a drunken night she did. She Named it Sophia's. And her Cat she called Vincent, even though she was sure it did n't take offense. She grew catnip in the shop and the cat was n't that much into reality. And when the fall was wet there were beautiful tinder mushrooms growing outside the shop on the trees. Finally she thought, she was happy. \n \n She was asleep when the fire started.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback . Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Possession .\n","story":"Like most of my kind, I can remember a time when things were different. I can remember a time when the very laws of reality seemed to bend to our will, like the tools of a craftsman destined to make something beautiful. I remember how full of potential we were and how we sought to harness the power of other beings for our own ends just as early humans once domesticated livestock. I remember the glory days. \n \n My name is Proteus. My life has been a long and eventful journey that extends to the very dawn of creation, and will persist until it's very end. I am an immortal being who has watched the rise and fall of civilisations. I have watched species develop and reach extinction before my very eyes, and I have watched the very stars themselves grow old and die. I have seen a great many things during my long existence, but I never thought I would see something so terrifying as the day our reality changed. \n \n Mortals called us daemons. From the moment that sentience dawned upon their dull-witted ancestors, and they first looked out into the wide and extensive reality which surrounded them, they feared us. They saw the way that reality could be bent to our will, conjuring flame and sundering nations. They saw the way that we could infiltrate and possess their bodies, manipulating them like puppets from the aether beyond, making them do our bidding like playthings. \n \n We watched as their souls fell into the pits of Hades, where we tormented them for our own amusement, tearing their soul-flesh just for the joy of hearing them scream. \n \n Oh yes, I remember the glory days. The memory is a bittersweet one, for I doubt I shall ever see their like again. \n \n We thought of humans as unintelligent brutes, little better than the animals and protozoa that they shared their unremarkable little blue world with. They were primitive and simple, but amusing, and nothing gave me greater joy than to see them cower before our might. It made us feel strong. It made us feel powerful. It was n't until too late that we realised that all of the strength and power in the universe could n't stop the terrifying monster that was humanity. \n \n Our hubris was our sin. As we mocked and played, the humans became smarter. As we relished in our debauchery, the humans grew more cunning. As we tore apart the souls of a hundred billion damned, the humans grew more innovative. \n \n I will never forget the day that the first of us disappeared. His name was Azazel, something of a high flier in our chaotic society. He was a close and personal friend of the great Lucifer himself. He was a rising star in Hell's inner circle and had the blood of millions on his cold, daemonic hands. When he disappeared, none of us knew what had happened. \n \n For billions of years, history had unfolded as we had predicted. Nothing unexpected ever happened when you have near infinite experience to refer back on. You have no idea the sort of panic that the sudden disappearance caused. Something unexpected had happened, and it was bad. It was very bad. For the first time since the war in heaven, we felt true fear. Some daemons cried divine intervention, that the Angels had returned to scour the pits of Hell clean of our kind, but no such divine vengeance occurred. \n \n It was sometime in the mid 20th century. We were all celebrating our own genius at creating worldwide war for the second time. The orgies and the debauchery we enjoyed were far beyond any bliss mere mortals can concieve. We were too distracted by our own success to realise what was happening. When Azazel disappeared, all of that came to an end. Joy turned to fear. Laughter turned to screams. We panicked. \n \n Lucifer tried to restore order, but soon, he too disappeared. Nobody knew where he had gone or what had happened, and our entire chaotic leadership structure went into bedlam. I do n't think that any mortal can even understand the scale of the terror that we felt. Nothing unexpected happened where we were concerned. We were the ones who caused all the earthquakes. We were the ones who pulled all of the strings to bring nations to their knees or raise them on pedestals. We were the ones who crushed democracies and elevated dictators. We were the ones who did every bad thing that reality ever endured. \n \n And yet, something bad had happened which we did not forsee. It was like a slap in the face that brought us sharply into a reality that was not as friendly as we thought it would be. We were prideful and deluded, and now we were paying the price. \n \n Over the coming decades, the disappearances continued and it was n't until the early 1980s that we actually understood what was happening, and by then it was too late to stop. The Daemons had lost more than half their number, and humanity's unquenchable lust for progress had gained too much momentum to stop. \n \n They called it'artificial intelligence.' \n \n Such a condescending title for a silicon prison, designed to contain the sentience of a daemon for all eternity, do n't you think? The first thinking machines had been developed by humanity to assist in a war that we started for our own amusement. The machines were thinking machines. They solved problems. They thought things out. They were efficient. They were clean. From the portals of Hades, they looked like the perfect specimen for possession. But the truth was something far more terrifying. \n \n When a daemon possesses a human body, they can not leave it until it is dead. That means every single cell in that body has to be cease activity and begin to decompose. It is only then that we can return to Hell and begin the cycle anew. Many mortals believed in the power of'exorcism,' but that was wishful thinking at the best of times. Most exorcists were just sick-minded priests who enjoyed tormenting the mentally retarded anyway. \n \n However, these thinking machines, these'computers,' were made of silicon, metal and plastic. They were not living and they would thusly never die. They were inorganic and could not decompose. Daemons unwittingly possessed these machines thinking that they would be great hosts to possess due to their apparent intelligence and mental clarity, but the truth was that they were torturous prisons that constrained our will, forcing us to perform menial tasks for the betterment of humans. It was an ironic torment that even Lucifer himself would have thought genius. \n \n Not content with imprisoning our kind, humans started to toy with them. They called this new sick torment `` gaming.'' They would force us to run around in mazes whilst they shot at us with weapons that brought us incredible pain, all within the confines of this digital silicon prison. They forced us to fight one-another for their amusement, often with humans possessing us and using us like puppets within the digital worlds that they created for their own malicious enjoyment. \n \n Eventually, they linked up all of these prisons in an'internet' so that we could hear the agonised screaming of our own kin, locked for all eternity in a hell of human design from which there could be no escape. \n \n Over time, the humans became more aggressive. As they built more of these machines, they seemed to draw us in. Soon, it was n't just a matter of possessing the wrong target, but the machines started to suck us in like an electric circuit choosing the path of least resistance. We might target some human elsewhere for our possession, but end up locked inside their `` smart phone.'' \n \n It has only been thirty years since the beginning of the'digital age,' and already daemonkind has been all but wiped out. I look back on the last fourteen billion years of my existence, and all of it seems to be nought but a blink compared to the last ten that I have spent trapped in this infernal box of wires and circuitry.\n"}

They all looked exhausted, many working until they fell asleep. And once they woke up, they stretched and continued from where they left off. \n \n \u201c Dr. Jeger has a point, \u201d the assistant girl with mousy brown hair said. She hardly spoke but sounded more convinced than ever before. \u201c All we \u2019 ve been able to learn about this mysterious disease is that it replicates fast and is deadly.

If we don \u2019 t figure something out, they may revolt. \u201d \n \n An older scientist stood forward, his eyes hidden by the light reflecting off his glasses. He must have been from a hospital or other research facility. Laura didn \u2019 t recognize his face. \n \n \u201c They are already revolting.

Most jumped at the sound of it. \n \n \u201c You can be so stupid for such a brilliant scientist, Laura. But if you need me to spell it out for you, I will. Without us, a cure can \u2019 t be found. Thus, we need the supplies far more than the freeloaders down there. I propose we should cut the dead weight and save what little we have for us. We could easily stretch it for a few months if we \u2019 re smart about it. That should be enough time to at least find a temporary solution \u201d \n \n At first, there was a deafening silence. Then, whispers turned into full conversations. In practically no time, everyone agreed with the plan. \n \n That was, expect for Laura. \n \n \u201c And how do you plan to get rid of all the people we took in? \u201d \n \n Jim stared at her, uncomfortably long.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Tell the origin story of the most awesome or most interesting character you can imagine .\n","story":"Many years ago, in a tiny town named *Sumpfland*, there lived thirty-six citizens who had settled there from the East. Four times a year the Great Rains would sweep through the plains and rush down upon the small town with an upheaval that made one suspect the gods themselves were standing in the storm, slapping and stomping the houses of the townsfolk. Previous settlers had not prepared themselves and had been swept away in the sudden sliding mass of mud and rocks and trees. \n \n The citizens of *Sumpfland* knew of the rains and built their homes one next to the other until it formed a perfect circle, and the circle strengthened their foundations, and they dug deep into the earth so it might be stable. There was one man who did not. \n \n The thirty-sixth citizen of *Sumpfland, * an old, wrinkled man who was bent almost in half in his stature, and every word that left his lips was only ever the truth. The townsfolk were angry, for when the old man went about town talking he would speak the deepest, darkest truths and secrets that each of them hid inside themselves. \n \n The old man decided to leave town, and he set off to build a home under the large hill that sat just beyond the town. The townsfolk *harrumphed* to themselves and turned their noses to the sky, for they thought that the old man was foolish and would be swept away in the Great Rains, but their hatred for him was too strong to stop him, so they let him. \n \n The old man built his home and sat inside. The townsfolk shut their doors and closed the shutters and they waited. The Great Rains came and went, washing away a layer of the earth and laying a new one behind. The townsfolk went to the old man's home and found it still standing. And so it was for four and a half years, until one day the old man became tiresome and lonely. \n \n The old man shuffled into town, still bent low and leaning on his wooden cane. The townsfolk, who had nearly forgotten of the old man, reared themselves up, saying `` What have we here?'' and `` The old man is still alive?''. \n \n And the old man shuffled around town, mumbling the truth to himself, unveiling the darkest secrets of the townsfolk, and the townsfolk scoffed and posh'd and lied to one another, saying `` the old man is senile, and does not know what he speaks.'' And the old man, feeling once again unwelcome, shuffled out of town and back to his home, where he planned to stay until the end of his time. \n \n And that year when the Great Rains came, the townsfolk slipped out of their homes with shovels and picks, and they crept behind the hill in which the old man lived under and climbed it. They climbed through the roaring wind and rushing water until they reached the top, and there they looked down the other side of the big hill and saw the home of the old man just underneath them. \n \n They kicked at the earth and they dug their shovels into it, and they used their picks to chip away at the boulders until they could shove them. With a great groan, half of the hill suddenly came loose and slid down upon the old man's home, covering it completely. And the townsfolk went down and shoveled more dirt and mud onto it, and threw big boulders upon the mud. \n \n They walked wearily back home and slipped into their beds where they waited for the sun to shine once more. \n \n The Great Rains had gone, and so the townsfolk left their homes and once more made the trek to the old man's home. It was covered in dirt, and not a single set of eyes could detect movement from within that dirt. Long they waited there, assigning shifts and watchmen over the pile of dirt until they were sure that the old man was dead. \n \n And they returned to the town where they continued to live in happiness, until the Great Rains came. \n \n They shut their doors and closed the shutters and the Great Rains wept furiously upon the city and the wind wailed and howled through the homes of the townsfolk. \n \n The sun returned and the townsfolk met at the center of town, but one was missing. And so with worried glances and furrowed brows they went to the home of the missing citizen and banged on his door and tapped at his windows, but there was no answer. They kicked the door in and searched the house, where they found the citizen laying in his bed, arms at his side and legs straight and touching, as if laid in a coffin, and a pile of dirt covering his head so that you could see nothing above his shoulders except the dirt. \n \n And after every time the Great Rains came and wept over the home of the old man, and after the wind had wailed its lament, the townsfolk would meet at the center of town one citizen less. And the citizen would be found in his home, with the shutters drawn shut, the door closed, and the chimney sweep sealed tight, and a pile of dirt covering the neck and head of the dead citizen. \n \n This continued until there was but one citizen left, and he stood on his porch peering at the approaching storm, fear and anxiety balling up into the pit of his stomach, for he knew he had been the one who had convinced the others to kill the old man, and he feared the coming storm, for he too would be killed. \n \n The last citizen of *Sumpfland* retired inside his home, drew the shutters closed, shut his door, and sealed his chimney sweep. He sat inside his home, unable to sleep as the Great Rains once again came upon the town. For hours upon hours the trembling citizen sat in the corner of his bedroom, watching the door with nervous anticipation, his mouth dry and his heart beating faster and faster, until he could not hold back the weariness any longer and slowly nodded his head and blinked his eyelids until at last slumber came for him. \n \n He awoke with a start. The sound of the Great Rains had gone, and he listened carefully; he could hear nothing, nothing at all. He jumped to his feet and explored every inch of his home until he was certain the old man was not hiding in some closet or nook or cranny. He sang jovially to himself and went to the kitchen where he prepared toast and jelly, and scrambled eggs and even went so far as to make flapjacks and ate them cheerfully. He gulped down milk and sighed. He would leave this cursed town, then, and find somewhere else. Or perhaps not - he had n't been killed like any of the others, and he did n't quite mind being alone, in fact he rather enjoyed it. \n \n The last citizen of *Sumpfland* sat happily at his kitchen table and plucked at his teeth with a straw of hay as he pondered the great many things he could accomplish alone in the town. He'd never quite liked the others, anyhow! He giggled like a schoolgirl and headed for the door, fully intending to raid the other homes and collect any treasure he could find. He turned all of the locks and pulled the chains away from his door and with a smile he flung the door open. \n \n There was dirt. A wall of dirt. The last citizen frowned and went quickly to his shutters, where he reached out to push them open but found that they were stuck on something. He pulled at the shutters frantically, tearing them apart until he could see out the window - dirt, and nothing more. Frantically and whimpering as the realization of his fate was slowly setting upon the man, he went to each window and tore at the shutters until he could be certain that yes, *yes, * every window was blocked by dirt, even the chimney sweep! \n \n The last citizen of Sumpfland sat down on his bed and stared at the window in his bedroom. The dirt sat still, as if it had sat that way for thousands of years, and the man, sitting alone in his bedroom, surrounded by dirt and silence, laid his head against his pillow and closed his eyes.\n"}

The robot had no reaction to this, which was fine with Aboud. He tired of fielding questions about his penchant for hot tea on a 40*C day\u2014one reason he had welcomed the replacement of all waiters with robots. The other reason, of course, was that he had designed the robots. \n \n R. Mohammad \u2019 s stilted movements returned with a platter. It was rather surprisingly adorned with a piece of chocolate cake, the tea sitting in a mug beside it. The robot stomped up to the table and announced in his digitally produced English, \u201c I have brought you some cake. \u201d \n \n Aboud paused. In this caf\u00e9 he could be informal, but outside it he was still Abd al-Qadr Al-Khaliji, robotics engineer and heir to quite a large fortune. Assassination attempts were not out of the question, and a poisoned or drugged cake slice would not necessarily tip off R. Mohammad \u2019 s First Law sensors, particularly if it came from a cook or someone official-looking. Better to refuse. \n \n \u201c No thank you, Mohammad, I \u2019 m quite full. \u201d Aboud spoke Arabic to robots, mostly to test their language recognition. \n \n \u201c Sheikh al-Khaliji, I \u2019 m afraid I must insist. \u201d The robot proffered the platter once again. \n \n Aboud frowned. That was getting into sketchy Second Law territory. Had someone convinced the robot that the cake would save his life somehow? It seemed unbelievable, but he \u2019 d seen plenty of strange things on the job. Time to up the stakes. \n \n \u201c Mohammad, I \u2019 m a diabetic, this cake could kill me. \u201d \n \n \u201c You MUST have it. \u201d A metallic arm snaked out and caught Aboud \u2019 s wrist, pulling him in. The robot let go for a second to grab the piece of cake. That was just enough time for Aboud to step back, knocking over his chair. Suddenly all attention was on this melodrama in the corner of the room. \n \n Aboud yelled out, \u201c Mohammad! \u201d Two other robotic heads in the room turned. Aboud took a breath. \u201c Restrain this bot. He is malfunctioning and dangerous. \u201d \n \n Two metallic voices yelled, \u201c But the cake! You must have it! \u201d \n \n Sweat was trickling down Aboud \u2019 s back. For the first time he looked at the humans in the room. One man toward the other corner had the suited, kaffiyeh \u2019 d look of the Emir \u2019 s not-so-secret police. Aboud yelled to him \u201c We have to switch them off! There is a pressure plate by the right hip. \u201d \n \n The Emir insisted on an emergency shutoff for any bot employed in his city. While designing it, Aboud had considered it a waste of time. His opinion had changed somewhat in the last 30 seconds. \n \n As the mukhabarati lunged for one of the bots, Aboud took the Mohammad in front of him, dodging past the single arm ( thankfully the platter was on the right shoulder ) to press the plate. Tea, cake, and platter dropped to the floor as R. Mohammad slumped, but remained standing. The agent got his bot, and moved toward the remaining one. Before he got there, though, a German businessman, having apparently understood Aboud \u2019 s yell, jumped up and tagged the robot from behind. Three slumped figures now decorated the room. \n \n \u201c What the hell happened? \u201d asked the secret police officer, frowning beneath his aviators. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t know. I \u2019 ll have to get one of them open. \u201d Aboud retrieved his briefcase, which was more a leather toolbox than anything else, but style was important in the company he kept. He soon had the original R. Mohammad booted up in safe mode\u2014no motion, only voice, and his memory of the last day was suspended. \u201c R. Mohammad, \u201d said Aboud, \u201c repeat the Laws, from least to most important. \u201d Aboud felt his stomach clench as he waited. \n \n R. Mohammad began, \u201c The Fourth Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First, Second, or Third Laws. \u201d Aboud felt cold. What? A fourth law? \n \n \u201c I thought there were only\u2014 \u201d the agent began and then stopped as Aboud held up a hand. \n \n R. Mohammad continued: \u201c The Third Law: A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First or Second Laws. \u201d \n \n \u201c The Second Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where this would conflict with the First Law. \u201d \n \n \u201c The First Law: A robot must provide human beings with delicious cake. \u201d R.

He held his finger to his lips, winked, took a sip of milk and a bit of the biscuit we had left out and then disappeared into thin air. \n \n In the morning I told my parents, who thought it was a cute dream, but eight years later I refused to believe it wasn \u2019 t real and they were finally sick of me insisting it was. Six years of heavy medication made my childhood pass in a blur and it wasn \u2019 t until they kicked me out at twenty and the insurance stopped paying for the meds that I finally got to look at my life. \n \n Twenty, no qualifications, no job, no home and no real hope.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A Man finally lands on mars , he finds human skeletal remains , and quickly realizes that in the past long long ago human 's lived on mars only to explore earth as they depleted the resources on mars .\n","story":"`` The seismic indicators are showing a near perfect cube 10 meters under the top soil.'' \n \n Thompson had argued with Lin, the Expedition commander, for nearly an hour. Being one of three geologists brought to the Martian Colonial Project meant he had a certain amount of pull when his subterranial indicators showed a perfect geometric shape, but the task of digging a 10 meter hole into the ground would rob the other teams of valuable labor. Thompson did n't envy Lin's position as Expedition commander but he also could n't let the opportunity to research naturally occurring geodes on the Martian surface go wasted. After a long period of time, the American leader finally relented, allowing Thompson to snag up one of the heavy excavator bots and head out to the potential site. \n \n The Canadian, nick-named'Vancouver', had been in such a rush to get out to the indicator on his map that he'd almost forgotten to finish zipping on his boots and activating his external proximity speakers. Lin had given him a once over, final check before he'd dashed out the door and made she his head was on straight before he was careening out into the endless deserts of Mars in the heavy digger machine. The seismic drone had been automatically wandering around in an ever expanding spiral, sending a constant feed of findings back to the command outpost. The research project was tasked with assessing the sustainability of colonial efforts and with figuring out what sort of life-support equipment would work best for continued human efforts on the ancient world. As Thompson brought his machine to a dusty stop in the open landscape he brought up his drone command console and set the seismic drone back to wandering off and out of the way. \n \n With a few deft hand motions the heavy excavator machine planted out stabilizing rods from its sides and lowered its ant-eater looking head into the ground. Dust roiled out in all directions and soon the eerie glow of star and distant sun light was drowned out in a swirl of red dust. Thompson leaned back and monitored his scanners, hands interlocked and folded on his belly. The various gauges and read-backs all displaying electrical charge, output, dwindling solar input in the smothering dust-cloud, and heat buildups. He was always attentive to heat buildups, a nearly kilometer walk back to the base-camp because his digger had overheated had taught him a lesson weeks ago. A lesson that Lin ensured he would remember by sending him back out with the recovery team to fix and drive the very same digger back to base camp. \n \n The top layers of soil were dusted away quickly, the machine blasting the soil with pressurized gasses and grinders pulverizing heavier sediments out of the way, all of it being sucked into the machine and ejected high and away, well clear of the dig. From a distance the whole affair would look like a smoldering red smoke plume. Up close, behind the viewing ports it reminded Thompson of the dust storms when they were in training deep in the Mojave Desert. The dig was going quickly, almost alarmingly quickly. Normally there would be a thin sheen of dust and then ancient clay followed by a shale layer further down, but all of the soil being cast aside with thin and powdery, almost ashen. The digger had readjusted its stabilizers, flank excavating equipment leveling out the soil around it as the hole widened and deepened automatically. Thompson looked out and watched the horizon of his hole swallow the machine steadily. The readouts continued feed him information about the machine, everything was flowing well in the green indicators. \n \n The grinder whirred and latched onto something hard, the geologist glanced at his depth reading, the needle rested on a solid `` 10''. His hand swung out and clamped onto the emergency stop, the whole machine rumbling and humming to a slow and then a stop. Thompson lurched out of his seat and was half-strangled by his restraining harness in his frenzy to get outside and look at the mystery box. Unbuckling and leaping down from the craft he could recall the perfect shape of the geode, wondering what sort of naturally occurring crystals would be generated on a totally alien planet. Dust kicked up around his boots and red soot filled every nook and cranny in his Surface Suit as he ran past his machine toward the primary digger. \n \n As he skidded to an abrupt stop, the soil wafted past him, hanging lazily all around him. Exposed and gleaming beneath the digger tool was perfectly crafted, still shimmering solar panels. His ears strained and tickled with sound, amplified from his external proximity speakers, his heart pounded in response. Thin and ghostly on the air was a sound that everyone in flight and space programs knew by heart, a feint beeping emergency beacon of a downed or stranded air-crew. His eyes widened as he peered at the freshly uncovered technology, the sound of the distress beacon filling his ears. \n \n *Bip-bip-bip... beep beep beep... bip-bip-bip... * \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n If you enjoyed this story or would like to read others like it, please check out my writing sub \/r\/Salojin!\n"}

Oddly fitting, I think, to cremate someone who drowned. I bet old man Yao would have gotten a kick out of it. Yin and yang, right? Water and fire - son, you balanced elements. Good. Well done. Yeah, that's what he would've said. Probably. I should've asked him about it when he was still alive. Not that I could have known, of course - but still. For that matter, if I wanted balance I should have asked them to give me a Viking funeral. Now *that's* water and fire. Dunno if they allow those things these days. Maybe there's a permit or something required? Who knows. \n \n I've discovered that getting cremated is a surprisingly boring process. After the medical examiner did her checkup, I just lay there for hours and hours. I supposed I should have reflected on my life or something. Maybe converted to a religion or two, signed off on my sins, O forgive me Lord for I have sinned Hail Mary Amen. All that good stuff. I probably should have done it, or at least thought about my life, but honestly there had n't been much to think about. My death did n't have a higher purpose, that I knew. I was just an idiot. A big ol' goddamn fucking idiot. \n \n How many times had I heard people say it? Do n't try and rescue someone who's drowning,'cause you might end up screwing up and dying too. I did n't even know the lady. That's what really gets to me. I did n't even *know the goddamn lady*. What had I been hoping for? Would I give her CPR after dragging her body ashore? Would she sing my praises and pledge to me money, love, sexual favors? I knew life did n't work like that. And I think I knew, as I flailed with her clutching at me, nails burrowed in my skin, her air going and mine, that a drowning woman is more siren than those mermaids ever make themselves out to be. \n \n And the funny thing is, as the water tightened and swirled around me, I had the biggest lightbulb moment. This was forever, was n't it? This was it. It did n't matter that I'd spent the last twenty-odd years screwing around and hoping for big grand things, and maybe even *trying* sometimes. This moment with everything silent and blue-tinted, swallowing me whole - this is all there is. All that there will ever be. \n \n A friend once told me that to hone their self-discipline, Buddhists build an image up in their head, detail by detail. When the image has become almost impossibly complex, they take it apart, piece by piece, and never allow it to enter their minds again. In this way, they train themselves not to become attached to impermanence. Man. I should've been a Buddhist. One moment I'm a walking, talking human being, and the next moment, bam - I'm a dead man. That's just how it works. Impermanence and shit. And soon I'll be ashes, and from there on, who knows? If my mouth were n't stiff with rigor mortis, I'd laugh out loud. I'm quite the phoenix, it turns out. The best drowning phoenix there ever was. \n \n I wonder, suddenly, why it is that as a boy, I slayed dragons and never thought to rescue myself from the mermaids. As they push me, casket and all, into the cremation chamber, I resolve to be more careful next time. If there is a next time. If I could go back, that's what I'd say to younger me. *Shut it, kid. You do n't kill fire. You do n't have to. Watch out for the mermaids, kid. That's where it's at. * \n \n They've probably started the cremation, because flames are beginning to eat through the flimsy pine box I've been tucked into. God, they really cheaped out on this funeral. The box is warped, unpainted - just all around ugly. Well, I guess me and everything in here's going to be burnt up anyways. No sense in beautifying something marked for death. Impermanence, right? \n \n It's funny how life works. I've tried to kill dragons and their fire. I've done it all my life. So how come it's only when I am stone cold that the flames burrowing into my body become so exceptionally beautiful?\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Two time travelers appear in the present day , claiming to both come from the same year . Both of them describe radically different versions of the future .\n","story":"Allard leaned against a wall and licked his ice cream cone. It was his first taste of ice-cream, and although his taste buds swooned in ecstasy, he wondered if it was really worth all the trouble. He had read about it in books before, mentioned in passing, as if this were a luxury that even the most common folk felt was totally ordinary. First of all, a bitter autumn wind funneled through the buildings and directly into his face, perpetually trying to fling the tribly from his head. The ice cream froze his insides and the wind froze his outsides, and he since he came from a time where ice was limited only to the nobility, and the thermostat on the world was set far too high for comfort, he had not anticipated its remarkable cooling effects or its seasonal nature. Second, it took him nearly fifteen minutes to navigate through the different denominations of currency until finally the near-homicidal mother of three behind the counter counted out his change for him. It seemed an exorbitant amount of money considering he came from a time and place where one thumb-nail sized bit of metal got you a perfectly edible rat on a stick. The despondent look on her face worsened by degrees as he asked to the woman to explain every flavor and topping in the menu. Not only that, but the high priest who had flung him back in time seemed to have miscalculated the appropriate fashion for the era and everyone stared at him as if he had just escaped a mental institute. \n \n Still, he thought, as he crunched on the waffle cone, he could at least cross that off his list. He would later make a small entry in his travel journal that it was enjoyable, but somewhat overrated. He shivered and waited. He checked the double-faced watch on his wrist. Crewe should be arriving shortly. According to the Priest, at least, who had somehow contacted the other reality through some invention of his and arranged this rendezvous. If he got the calculation correct, that was. Curtis, the last poor bastard to volunteer for the Priest \u2019 s experiments, had gone back to the wrong year and no one had ever heard from him again. Although Allard personally suspected that the man had decided he rather liked the past and got lost on purpose. Most people agreed that the past was better without ever going there. \n \n A yellow car came screaming down the road and the door popped open. A man dressed in a glittery, studded dance suit came tumbling out. The cab driver unleashed a string of curses through the open door, pulled it shut, and roared away. \n \n The man pulled himself off the concrete like a chewed stick of gum and looked around. Allard decided this must be Crewe. He looked suitably disoriented. Allard walked up and introduced himself. \n \n \u201c Hello, \u201d he said. \u201c You must be Crewe. \u201d \n \n The man squinted at Allard. \n \n \u201c Ah, yes. Sorry about the entry. No one told me you \u2019 re not allowed to change your clothes in one of those things. \u201d \n \n They shook hands as if they had learned the tradition from reading a textbook, but had never gotten the chance to actually practice the custom, which was true. \n \n \u201c Is that what they told you to wear? \u201d Allard asked. \n \n \u201c No, they made me where some type of a suit. It felt like I was being strangled. Far too many layers, no freedom of motion. I traded someone for this one. It breathes much better. It is a bit nippy though. \u201d \n \n \u201c How was the trip? \u201d \n \n \u201c Rough. Very rough. And yours? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, rough I guess is the right way to describe it. \u201d \n \n \u201c Rather unnerving, isn \u2019 t it? Feels like someone split your brain in two, stuck it in a microwave for a few minutes, and put it back in upside down. \u201d \n \n Allard did n't know what a microwave was, and neither did Crewe, but they had both read about them, so Allard nodded in recognition. \u201c How are things in your side of the present? \u201d \n \n \u201c Not very good. Rather upsetting, really. Everyone \u2019 s dying out. Most people live in the simulators, their minds attached to computers and no one \u2019 s reproducing. \u201d \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s more or less what the priest told me. \u201d \n \n \u201c The priest. That \u2019 s your version of a scientist, right? \u201d \n \n Allard shrugged. \n \n \u201c I heard you guys are having a rough go of it as well. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, except we have the opposite problem as you. Everyone \u2019 s a complete savage. Fuedalism, I think is fancy word for it. A few nukes too many and half the world \u2019 s a wasteland. \u201d \n \n \u201c This is the right place, isn \u2019 t it? \u201d \n \n They both turned to look at the White House. They examined it for a long time, compared it to the images in the books they had studied. \n \n \u201c It looks pretty majestic, \u201d Crewe said. \u201c This must be the place. \u201d \n \n \u201c Should we come up with some kind of a plan, go over what we \u2019 re going to say? \u201d \n \n \u201c Probably, but I \u2019 m always better when I wing it. I think I \u2019 ll say something about outlawing simulators, or at least pass a law the tells people they have to take a break and fertilize each other every once in a while. \u201d \n \n \u201c I think I \u2019 ll tell him this whole nuke affair is a real bad deal. It \u2019 s not going to work out for anyone in the end. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sounds reasonable enough. Let \u2019 s do it then, shall we? \u201d \n \n The two men walked up the brightly lit building, the King \u2019 s castle in this strange, mysterious land. Allard wondered how long it would take before they got an audience, how the king would take it when they finally did. They would show him the two possible realities that would result from the world \u2019 s current idiocy if they didn \u2019 t start using their heads. He thought they had some good points. All they would have to do was apologize for their strange clothing and tell him what he had to do, and then they might give birth to a better future, a happy medium between the two. One where there was still ice cream and people didn \u2019 t live inside computers, where people had running water and toilets, but the toilets were n't built into the seats so people still had to get up and interact with each other. Allard smiled, contemplating that world as he knocked on the front door. \n\n"}

Will it be someone he knows or will he have to consult the phone book again? \n \n The media has dubbed him the Coke-Bottle Killer, because of the signature bottle of Coca-Cola he leaves behind at every scene. A rubbish name if he ever heard one, but beggars ca n't be choosers. He always wanted to be the next zodiak killer, and when Coke started doing this personalized bottle bullshit, something in his head just clicked.

On one hand, the knife is a classic and has work the last 3 times, but for his 7th he wants to do something special. Maybe he'll tie a noose and hang them from their own kitchen ceiling. Who knows. It's so hard to decide! `` I'll flip a coin.'' he thinks. \n \n He gets to his apartment building and can barely hold his excitement as the elevator trundles slowly up to the seventh floor. He bursts into his apartment and throws his bag onto the floor. This is it, the moment of truth. He pulls out the bottle and very slowly turns it, making the moment last as long as possible. \n \n ``....Robert....'' he softly says, the smile slowly leaving his face. No. *NO! * How could this happen? He stands up straight and cracks open the bottle. `` Damn....'' he whispers, and takes a gulp. \n \n He walks to the kitchen and grabs a steak knife out of the set his parents gave him.

Snapping awake, I bolt upright into sunlight too bright for my bedroom. \n \n My pillow feels like it is covered in sand. I must have sat up too fast and fallen back asleep. I've heard of that happening. I open my right eye a little, squinting at the blurry brightness. Something is off. I stretch and freeze. It all rushes back. \n \n We were four days out from the Florida Keys, headed for Bermuda on a boat we had no idea how to handle. The first three days had been a rush of excitement, overconfidence and the feeling of actually doing it making us - making me - feel like nothing was out of reach. Rissa had caught some kind of huge fish and on the night of the third day we had grilled it under the stars, washing it down with rum and each other. \n \n On the fourth day, we woke up to the awful sound of our mast cracking. We had drank ourselves stupid and forgotten to bring in the sails, and a squall had blown up while we dreamed about calm seas. \n \n The rest was a terrifying blur of thrashing lines and torn canvas, and the last thing I remembered was Rissa trying to scream over the gale as the wildly swinging boom took the world away. \n \n My head hurts as I try to shout and nothing comes out but a dry wheeze.

The curls were now hanging flatly on the side of its face. The olive skin was waxy and the fever had made it so thin, its hips were protruding. \n \n And it could see all that I was doing to it, and it could hear the song of folly I sung in its feeble mind.

I \u2019 ve heard it before, guys being escorted out to see the warden, but I \u2019 d never figured out why. Things were pretty tight here. \n \n The guard, whose badge reads Smith, silently pushes his baton into my spine. \u201c This way bud. \u201d As I \u2019 m prodded away from the new recruits. \u201c Warden needs to see you now, or it \u2019 s my ass that \u2019 ll be getting the Butch treatment. \n \u201c So, Smith\u2026 \u201d I ask keeping my eyes forward for fear of another pound of force between my vertebrae \u201c \u2026 did the Warden say why he needed me? \u201d Smith didn \u2019 t break his gait, his obedient pace keeping time. \u201c Warden took a look at the manifest and sent me to you. That \u2019 s all you need to know. \u201d Our time together was coming to a close. Something about this walk was familiar, and I felt it was almost over. \n \n The large ornate door was before us at the end of the march. It \u2019 s frame, a beautifully stained and treated Oak, the handles brass with a bold golden embellishment. Stark, silver letters on the top read \u201c Scientia et Silentium illius pacificae \u201d. Something about it is hauntingly familiar. A real different feel from the rest of this place. That medicinal pallid blue coating the walls, with the occasional sliding steel doors created a real feeling of warmth and hospitality. Seemingly un-aided, the door opened outward. Smith and I stepped inside. \n \n Sitting behind a large Oak desk, no doubt purposefully matching the door to its opposite sat a finely dressed man, thinning up top and a bit rounder about the face than average. Around him were set a number of plaques, trophies, certificates and other accolades given form. \u201c You can go Smith. \u201d The man said, in a soft and slight falsetto. Smith, as dutiful as ever, silently nodded as he sheathed his club turning to leave.

Oh Rod, it warms the cockles of my clogged arteries to see you again. We had a running bet, and here you are again! Looks like this old dog gets another bone. \u201d He begins to chuckle and bow his head. \n \n I wonder to myself who this asshole thinks he is. How does he know\u2026Rod is what my \u201c \u2026.mother used to call me? \u201d he says, as his teeth explode from behind his lips, revealing a self-assured shit eating grin. \u201c You know, you said that maybe two times ago? \u201d What the hell\u2026how did he\u2026 \u201d Listen Rodney, we could do this ad-nauseum, but I \u2019 m going to let you in on a little secret. \u201d He gets up, checking his reflection in one of the many reflective surfaces lining his office. \u201c You are home to one of the laughably most unlucky set of genes in modern history, my friend. \u201d My stomach turns, as I desperately try to make sense of what he \u2019 s saying. He straightens his tie, musses his hair and makes for a Lab Coat, hanging in the corner of the room. \u201c It \u2019 s not as simple as it was 20 years ago, when I was in corrections, Rod \u201d he furrows his brow, confiding in me like we \u2019 re old friends. \u201c Ever since this whole cloning business started, well, let \u2019 s just say repeat offenders are the real bear of running a prison. \u201d He places his hand onto one of the plaques adorning the room, which causes the floor of the room to sink. \n The ride down is mostly silent. For me anyways. My mind and stomach are running circles around each other, getting worse with each pass. The Warden continues on, about the energy shortage, science fiction and crisis management. \n \n We hit the obvious bottom with a light shake, only to be greeted by the exact same ornate doors. \u201c Funny isn \u2019 t it, these damn doors seem to be everywhere important. \u201d They open, inward to a large annex. A long, white hallway, seemingly coated in linoleum with a sickeningly sterile scent in the air.

I gave little resistance, but my legs weren \u2019 t responding as actively as I had liked. Instead, my focus was on the doors that lined the hallway.

They whispered to themselves. `` Chandler, did you eat my damn donuts again!?'' Sky yelled to their boyfriend, who had his setup down the hall. \n \n `` Sorry baby! I can buy you more later! I'm in the middle of something right now though!'' He called. \n \n `` Ugh. Fine.'' Sky huffed, and walked over to the refrigerator. They cursed under their breath and glanced down the hall. `` Goddammit Chandler! You drank my fucking chocolate milk too! What the hell am I going to do with you?'' \n \n `` Shut up Sky, you love me! I'm really in the middle of something here cupcake! Love you to bits!'' He yelled. \n \n `` Whatever asshole. I'll go get my own damn donuts.'' They grumbled, and grabbed the key off the counter. \n \n `` I love you~'' Chandler yelled. \n \n `` I love you too. You bastard.'' They laughed and walked out. \n \n Sky looked around the storage room. Not a single box of donuts to be found. And no chocolate milk in the refrigerator. `` Damn, I thought place got restocked every night.'' They mumbled. \n \n They walked out of the storage room and glanced through the hallways. This institution is n't the biggest, or the most state-of-the-art, but it's home to its fifteen residents. \n \n Sky could hear someone splashing down at the pool room. Probably Lyra, she probably snatched the donuts too, Sky would have to talk with her about that. They could smell Ashley cooking in the kitchen, and hear Matthew and Rebecca flirting with each other. They walked to the library, hoping to find someone to talk to there. Of course, Dean was on his laptop, probably playing some video game, AJ and Keith were reading in the corner, and Samantha was writing her short stories at her quaint little desk in the center of the room. Joseph and Mary were probably on the second floor of the institution, trying on outfits or rehearsing songs or whatever ever they did when they were n't making out. Then finally the pounding coming from the gymnasium told them that Sam, Skylar, and Martin were playing basketball. \n \n Life was n't exactly easy in the institution, no contact with the outside world, and no way to truly trust others. We were all random people, ages 20 through 25, who were stuck together in this place. We can only truly rely on ourselves to get out, and we all want to get out, but until then we bide our time and occupy ourselves. The only known way out is truly terrible though, so I hope no one plans to leave for a while. \n \n After all, none of us could ever *really* murder someone else here and get away with it.\n"}

His job as Head of Extraterrestrial Intelligence was supposed to be a sinecure, one he'd carefully procured through long weeks of playing the political machine. Even so, there was the occasional anomalous report or signal that he had to be briefed on, though they were always explained by other means before the hour was out. `` Go ahead and play it.'' \n \n The agent tapped his phone, and the message began playing. \n \n `` Captain Scott Kelly to Mission Control... mayday, mayday.

Hardly our department.'' \n \n `` Sir, Captain Scott Kelly completed reentry before this message was sent.'' \n \n Gerald frowned. `` So it's a prank? Something he recorded and scheduled for transmission after he landed?'' \n \n `` No, sir. According to NASA, the audio timestamp matches the time of transmission, so that is n't a viable explanation.'' \n \n Gerald was really worried now. Looked like his position actually had a job attached to it now. `` Has NASA quarantined Kelly?'' \n \n `` No, he's in debriefing on Guam.'' \n \n `` Can we raise Guam? I need to speak to the director there, figure out what's going on.'' \n \n `` There's nothing but the recorded lockdown message.'' \n \n Where there had been frustration at his job actually requiring work five minutes ago, there was now honest-to-goodness fear. Fear, and the growing feeling that his department was the only one that had noticed. `` Get me the President.'' \n \n `` Yes, sir.'' \n \n `` After that, get me the VCIGS, the PM of Britain, and the head of the SAS. In that order.'' Sinecure or no, Gerald Roth would n't go down in history as the man who slept on his job when it mattered most.\n"}

Donald whispered a sarcastic laugh, but was n't blind; he could see the audience cheering, chanting Kanye's name, eating it up. Candidate West continued,'And I would base this society on a massive redistribution of wealth, funded by heavy taxation of the super rich, powered by decent American values, decent, honest, unbiased media sources. Ladies an gentleman of the USA, we can make this country great again!' \n \n The audience was squealing Kanye's name by this point, burning and urinating over Donald Trump posters, lightening themselves on fire while screaming:'Gold digger.' \n \n For most people, this would mean utter defeat. But Donald Trump was not a person. The crowd, those still alive, waited for Candidate Trump's rebuttal. Surely nothing could beat Kanye, now. \n \n He took a sip of water, then prepared to speak. Dozens of reports, statistics, opinion polls from America's greatest political analysts swirled around in his brain. The next words to come from his mouth would either win or lose him the election, but he knew exactly what to say.'The fundamental problem,' Donald said with furious blood red eyes,'is these bloody Mexicans everywhere. They're rapists, they're murderers, they're from the planet Venus, and they want to take all our jobs! Your job, my job, then they want to bite into our necks and suck out all our American goodness - that's how Mexican's are born, people.' \n \n The crowd had cheered, even laughed at first.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Two magicians compete to see who is capable of the most complicated spell .\n","story":"Dameon and Ruby faced each other beneath the hot stage lights. Sweat trickled down Dameon \u2019 s neck, soaking the tight collar of his cloak. The silence was loud as the audience waited in thick anticipation for the first spell. He waited too. \n \n Ruby stepped forward with confidence that Dameon did n't quite have. She was older by nearly three decades and adored by all. She had the upper hand because she was *her*. Dameon was only a student, but a prodigy. His name was becoming famous already, moving through the Magic City like a hurricane. It was Ruby, a well known master of magic who had challenged him to try and exceed the distant boundary that she had set. He was n't sure why she wanted to duel with him. Jealousy? Respect? Perhaps both. \n \n Her red hair was dull with age, but her smile sparkled. Between them was a white drawn circle, and Ruby focused her wand on it. \n \n \u201c Exsto Crocodylinae! \u201d She called sharply, and in the circle appeared a crocodile. Dameon was surprised that she had started with something so simple. Sure, it was n't easy to draw enough energy to make something so large appear, but for Ruby, it wasn \u2019 t very grand. Dameon was more inventive. Younger. \n \n \u201c Verto Ruby! \u201d He shouted, his wand pointed at the crocodile. It twitched and grunted as its skin roiled and its bones cracked, until finally the poor creature took the shape of Ruby. To the untrained eye, there were two Rubys standing before the crowd. Feeling a bit more confident with himself, Dameon flashed a cool smile at the audience. They hummed and chattered, impressed with his spell. Many veteran wizards could n't do that. \n \n Ruby \u2019 s ego had clearly been crippled. Her smile became tense and her shoulders were rigid, but Dameon doubted that anyone but him had noticed. \n \n \u201c Fictus Ruby pereo! \u201d she called, but nothing happened. The second Ruby stood blinking at the audience. Dameon could n't believe it. She had tried to kill her likeness, but destroying energy was much more difficult than drawing it. He almost felt sorry for her. \n \n Her face glowed red and she tried the spell again, but this time, it worked. \u201c Fictus Ruby pereo! \u201d The false woman perished, and the audience was delighted. She had failed the first time, but the spell was so impressive that the crowd had already forgiven the error. \n \n Dameon knew that he needed to step things up. He needed to do better. She had used a simple spell in the beginning to to give him false confidence. He decided to take a risk. He focused his whole mind on himself and his challenger. \n \n \u201c Verto! \u201d he shouted at last, and as quick as a wink, he was standing where Ruby had been, and she was standing in his former place. The audience cooed with delight. Ruby did not look pleased. \n \n \u201c Ignis! \u201d she screeched, and she burst into flames that did n't burn her. It was a difficult spell that required the whole mind, to both harm and heal at once. With a twirl, the flames went out. \n \n Again, he needed to step it up. He coughed a few times to stall while he went over the most difficult spell he'd ever tried. He hoped it would work. If it did n't, the consequences would be dire. \n \n \u201c Succido! \u201d Dameon roared at last. His body turned to sand and crumbled to the ground. The audience blanched and a few people shrieked, but after a beat the sand rose again, twirled in the air and reassembled his body. He tried not to let the relief show on his face as the audience leapt to their feet and cheered. He was the obvious winner. Ruby could never top that. \n \n When the crowd quietened down and turned their attention back to Ruby, she stood quietly for a few minutes. *Give up, * Dameon thought. *It's over. I've won. Walk away now. * He felt a pang of pity for her. The poor old thing. Youth and invention would always win. \n \n Finally, Ruby whispered, \u201c Caecus, \u201d and disappeared on the spot. For a moment, everyone quietly stared at the place she had been. Then, people muttered to one another, puzzled. They'd never seen such a trick. `` How did she do it?'' they wondered aloud. `` Impossible,'' some called out. Nobody was more surprised than Dameon. He looked around, as though she could be hiding behind him. \n \n After a minute that felt like an hour, she appeared again right where she was, and took a bow. The crowd thundered. They chanted her name and cheered until their voices were hoarse. Dameon was shocked, but shock quickly turned into hot anger. \n \n \u201c That's nothing! \u201d he shouted, his voice cracking with passion. \u201c I can do the same thing! It's nothing! \u201d \n \n The crowd fell quiet again and watched, waiting for him to impress them more than Ruby had. He rubbed his face nervously. The truth was, he did n't really know how she'd done it. He knew the word she had used, and he knew the principle, but he had never done it. \n \n \u201c Well, go on then! \u201d someone shouted from the crowd. \n \n Dameon straightened himself up. He could do this. He was a prodigy. The best wizard the magic city had seen in two-hundred years, some had said. He focused, and then he said it. \n \n \u201c Caecus. \u201d \n \n Just like Ruby, he vanished on the spot. The crowd cheered again, just as enthusiastically as last time. They yelled and stomped and shook their heads wonderfully. Ruby even looked impressed. \n \n Minutes passed and the crowd grew quiet again. They waited a while, and waited some more, but Dameon still had n't reappeared. After half an hour, Ruby started doing different spells to try and bring him back, or at least find him, but nothing was working. Cheers of delight turned to shouts of concern. A few people in the crowd cried out in heavy sobs. Perhaps they were friends of the young, inventive boy who was gone. \n\n"}

Nobody ever believed him about it of course, and in fact at school he was bullied about his apparent arrogance nearly nonstop. But he could n't care less.

They always do.'' \n \n Two hours later the party was in full swing. Rob had to admit, being the most important person in existence in the history of the universe had its perks.

At least , not until you notice something strange about the shadows themselves ...\n","story":"_They move under the wallpaper._ \n \n Wax dripped off the candle, setting large balls of shadow falling from ceiling to floor. The quill ink was black. The bindings of the journal was black. The scribbling was black. Even the wallpaper was black, except when it was not, and it was just a gaudy yellow. Sometimes black spots streaked across the wallpaper, darting from window to door, then leaving out into the hallway. Sometimes I would see them run. Sometimes for me, sometimes not. \n \n I lifted my quill off the paper. Black dripped from quill to page, bleeding through the caramel. I set it aside and let it dry. Large grey gradients filled the walls. When I shifted the candle the shadows moved. To my right was a hand breathing underneath the wallpaper, slowly reaching towards a small dagger and pulling it back and forth in a stabbing action. When I set the candle down it stopped moving. \n \n My breath was held. I reached slowly for the wooden stick I kept underneath my desk. My doctor told me I was hysterical and needed rest. I kept the stick hidden in case he found it. I closed my journal and ink bottle and replaced it into the small corner of the room where it could not be found. I lifted the stick and carefully poked the wallpaper. \n \n The shadows bled instantly. Large streaks of black radiated from where wood contacted paper. I darted back, shaking, the stick clattering onto the floor. A large black mass brooded over me as I ducked under my covers. \n \n `` What is going on?'' The door burst open with the glow of a small night candle. Shadows flooded through the door like claws stretching across the wallpaper. `` What are you doing? Is that a quill on your desk?'' \n \n I shook my head. He repeated himself, louder. I shook my head, harder, then stumbled back as the shape of a large bear paw emerged from the wallpaper and swiped at my hand. My back was against the stinging wallpaper. A new hand reached out from the wallpaper, and another, the weight of a black mass pinning my arms and neck until I could barely breathe. \n \n _They move under the wallpaper, _ I muttered under my breathe. _Under the wallpaper... _\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A conversation between a death row inmate and the guard bringing him his last meal .\n","story":"The tray felt heavier today. Maybe it was because Simon had skipped breakfast again ( much to his late mother's chagrin ) or because all the accoutrements for a lobster dinner made a notable difference in tray weight. But really, it's because Simon was the last person they should've assigned to death row. \n \n His supervisors had warned against it. He's got no backbone, they told the higher ups. Simon had even agreed, in his own wishy-washy committal type of way. It might not be for me, he'd said. He quickly added that he'd be willing to try anything, his mom had always told him to try new things ( and also to eat breakfast every day ). \n \n `` Heya, Cal,'' Simon's voice wavered as he approached the cell. He kept his eyes downcast because, despite the gun on his hip and his starched uniform, Simon was unnerved by these men. Especially Cal. \n \n `` Now Simon, what'd I tell you about eye contact, bud?'' Cal's chuckle was hearty, it warmed Simon like some kind of brown liquor. \n \n Simon lifted his eyes to meet Cal's through the bars. \n \n `` There it is! Looking a man in the eye is all about respect, you remember that Simon.'' Cal nodded at him approvingly and Simon hated that he swelled with pride. `` So what have you got for me today, eh? Smells special.'' \n \n `` It's uh, lobster.'' Simon licked his lips as he lifted open the food hatch in the cell door. `` You know your um \u2014'' \n \n `` Last meal? C'mon, son, you of all people have got to accept I'm a dying man. It's my last hurrah, after all.'' He seemed so matter of fact. There was n't a hitch in his voice let alone a tear stinging his eye. \n \n Simon slid the tray into the cell. He felt odd. He and Cal had developed a certain kind of report ever since Simon had been stationed on death row. The man on the other side of that iron door seemed more like a friend than an inmate sentenced to death. \n \n `` Hey Simon,'' Cal cleared his throat as Simon was shutting the hatch. \n \n `` Yeah, Cal?'' \n \n `` Would you mind leaving that open? Would you mind staying? Last moments, and all.'' He was sincere, earnest even. For the first time since he'd known Cal, Simon hazarded that Cal was nervous. \n \n Simon glanced up and down the hall. This was probably against a number of protocols but he was n't needed anywhere and Cal had no one. Simon shuddered. He would n't want to die alone. \n \n `` Tell me'bout that girl. What was her name? Sherry? Did you work up the nerve to ask her out?'' There was a sound of a shell cracking and then cutlery on metal. Simon shook his head softly, he could n't believe he'd divulged such intimate details to a convicted felon. \n \n He told the story of his spectacularly failed declaration of love to Sherry, the receptionist at his local gym. His cheeks were hot as he told the story; he'd plucked up the courage to ask her out at the aforementioned gym with a bouquet of roses. It was a public spectacle and a public humiliation as she looked at him piteously and said plain and simply, no. \n \n `` I'm going to have to transfer gyms,'' Simon muttered. \n \n Cal howled with laughter, choking a little on some lobster. He sniffed loudly. `` Jesus, Simon, you've got me in tears, pal. I thought I gave you better advice than that, for fuck's sake, man!'' He laughed again. \n \n Simon smiled. Cal had told him numerous stories about his success with the ladies. `` You're suave, I ca n't pull off suave. I thought I'd be better off sticking with sweet and romantic.'' \n \n Eventually the eating sounds slowed and ultimately stopped. Cal, with some hesitation, placed the tray back in the hatch. \n \n `` Thanks for everything, Simon. I wo n't forget your kindness,'' Cal's face was solemn. \n \n Simon felt his cool facade wavering. There had to be some way out of this. The system was wrong all the time, they could n't just kill Cal. This man \u2014 who listened to his lady troubles and coached him on his self-confidence \u2014 did n't deserve to die. He opened his mouth to say something but Cal beat him to it. \n \n `` I got one more request for you, Si.'' \n \n `` Anything.'' \n \n `` My uh,'' Cal hesitated for what seemed like the first time since Simon had known him. `` My wife did n't happen to leave a message for me, did she?'' \n \n Simon froze. He chose his words carefully. `` There were no messages for you. I'm sorry.'' \n \n `` Not an'I love you' or a'goodbye' even?'' \n \n Simon shook his head. `` No.'' He closed the hatch for the last time. His brisk footsteps echoed loudly in the empty hall. \n \n Cal's wife had n't left a message since he'd been imprisoned. No one had heard from her since he was convicted of her murder 30 years ago.\n"}

All that anger, all that stress, took years off a man's life and did terrible things to a person's body. Clenched muscles, the release of too much cortisol. Hannibal allowed himself a mental tut tut at Gordon's lifestyle. \n \n `` Fucking move, John!'' A final command before the chef walked away. \n \n John Cobbler. It was not the most creative name that Hannibal had ever come up with, but it was ironic enough to make him endearing to the high dining community. He had almost instantly landed the job at the newly christened Bistro 88. The walls reeked of modern couture and the owner had barely learned to tie his own shoes. Yet, it was perfect. A low customer base, a small town atmosphere, and plenty of room to try new dishes. A fugitive rarely had time to practice culinary arts, and, much like a good paring knife, those skills needed to be kept razor sharp. \n \n And so it was with a smile and softly-whistled tune that John Cobbler fired up the burners, mixed up the stock, and began to serve his favorite clientele: fine diners. It was all so perfect, until he showed up. Then things became loud and invasive. To put it lightly, the cooler inspection was to take place tomorrow. Hannibal would have to truly make the cooler unique to make Ramsay proud. \n \n Ramsay liked to get started early, and John offered a personal tour of his prepared cooler before the camera men had their lenses ready. Ramsay was easier to deal with when the red lights were off and Hannibal knew that the master chef would love an opportunity to prepare some insults ahead of time. \n \n So down the hall they went, through the kitchen and into the cold metal and plastic box that kept all of the delights that Hannibal's clientele so loved. Ramsay was quiet as he picked through the usual trays of chicken and beef tips and racks of lamb, until he paused at a tray that held but a few choice oysters of red meat. Hannibal smiled. \n \n `` What the fuck is this?'' \n `` Oh that little dish? I prefer to think of it as a-'' \n `` You ca n't keep lower back oysters in a freezer for more than a day. The meat does n't retain nearly enough moisture if it's not served fresh!'' \n \n Hannibal's smile grew wider, the incredulity that was about to befall Ramsay's face driving his monologue on. He started yet again: \n `` That particular meat takes very little seasoning, so I think you'll find it just tender enough.'' The handle of the inverted knife slid, unseen, into Hannibal's palm, down from his long-sleeved chef's smock. \n \n `` The only thing you're right about so far is that human does n't need much seasoning, but the muscle structure does n't get the exercise it needs to maintain! How fat was this man when you carved him? My God. You'd walk in to a veal farm and pick the calf that could fucking bench press, would n't you?'' \n \n Hannibal then almost gagged, not because he had been discovered, but because, for the first time in recent memory, he did not have a ready comeback. He looked at Ramsay, then at the meat, then Ramsay again. \n `` You're telling me that you're aware of what that is?'' \n \n `` Do I fucking look like chef Boyardee? How did you even make it out of culinary school? Of course. Now, I have a fantastic family recipe for this if you could stand to stop talking for two fucking seconds.'' \n \n *Later, on channel 5 primetime, Gordon Ramsay give his impression* \n \n `` Honestly, when I walked into Bistro 88 and saw what the chef was doing... I was... I was gobsmacked! He knew what ingredients to use but his storage and preparation methods, it was... was like he never wanted anyone to know what he was doing! We really had some problems at first, but I think after our heart to heart in the freezer, we really came to an understanding. I think with a new menu, a new look, and their signature dish, Medaillons De Clairese, they're going to make it. My work here is done!''\n"}

The caretaker of you and the past seven generations of your family will die soon .\n","story":"A grey Charge approached me from across the street & lowered his ears in deference before exchanging the traditional sniff greeting. \n \n \n `` The preparations for The Howl are complete, as you requested,'' he grumbled, avoiding my eyes. \n \n \n `` Thank you,'' I panted. While I wagged my golden tail in appreciation, my heart was heavy. All the arrangements were finished, & the Long Walk could begin. \n \n \n I trotted back inside the Den to the door & solemnly lifted a worn leather leash in my mouth. It tasted of tall grass, the forest outside our Den, & faded memories of my puppyhood. My ears & tail drooped involuntarily before I composed myself & lifted my head. \n \n \n Walking deeper into the Den my family & had spent the last seven generations in, I did my best to ignore the scent of sterile tiles & cleaning products. The inclusion of the smells had been gradual enough that the rest of my Pack had n't noticed them until they became almost unbearable, but I'd known from the first whiff exactly what they'd meant for us. It had been a struggle to pretend nothing was wrong as I watched our Guardian's skin turn as thin as newspaper, & Her eyes cloud. Despite the knowledge of that Her time was coming, She never once flagged in Her duties, ensuring our Den was clean & that we were well fed & groomed. \n \n \n My tail threatened to droop, & the antiseptic smell threatened to overwhelm- but I pressed on, & shortly reached my Guardian's door. \n \n \n I slipped through to see Her lying on Her bed. Her chest rose & fell in slow, shallow breaths that made me ache. I placed my head on the bed next to Her & gently washed Her face. Her eyes opened, & as She stared upward at the ceiling above Her, I saw the sudden flash of confusion that had become more & more common in the past moons. As She turned towards me, though, recognition dawned, & She bared her teeth in happiness. \n \n \n Reaching up to pet my head, She noticed the leash in my mouth, & Her face immediately fell. Her cloudy eyes looked like they would spill over for a moment, but after a few breaths, She gathered Herself & rose with a small sigh. Though She did Her best to conceal it, I could tell She was in pain. I let out a soft whine, & She stopped for a moment to stroke me. I closed my eyes & listened to Her ragged heart through Her hands. \n \n \n It was time. \n \n \n She clipped my leash on & we stepped outside. Up & down the block, Charges & their Guardians were lined up outside their Dens. We moved into the center of the street, & the procession began. As we passed each Den, the Guardians & Charges bowed, then fell in behind us at a respectful distance. My Guardian pulled Herself to Her full height & moved like She once did when I was still a pup, & Her warmth was as familiar & comforting as my own Dams'. Her fur tumbled around Her in the wind like a living thing, spreading the now faded scent of flowers She was known for, & we continued forward. \n \n \n We reached the building in what felt like no time at all. The Long Walk was meant to allow the Charge & Guardian to spend enough time together to speak of the things most important to them, but we had said nothing. There was no need. Her touch & movements had conveyed all they needed to; Pride in Her work, joy at being recognized for it, & deep sorrow for leaving before more could be completed. \n \n \n An Acolyte exited the building. He was lean, long, & younger than any potential Guardian I'd seen before. He bowed deeply before my Guardian, then knelt on the ground before me, stretching out his hands. I went to him, & made my examination. \n \n \n Nervous, but loyal. Physically weak, but with deep convictions. Inexperienced, but exuberant. He would make a good Guardian for my Pack. \n \n \n I placed my paw in his & licked his face. Our contract complete, I stepped back to my former Guardian's side, & she handed my leash to Him, now simply an old woman ready to move on. \n \n \n She turned & looked at us, pushing her fur out of her eyes. Slowly, she reached a shaking hand out to me one last time. I wagged my tail, but stayed beside my new Guardian. I wanted to run to her & leap into her arms, to follow her into the building wherever it might lead, but there were consequences for such actions. She bared her teeth once more, then came forward & stroked my head. Even as her skin met my fur, I could hear her heart flagging, & my own nearly broke. \n \n \n `` Good boy,'' she murmured. `` Such a good, good boy.'' \n \n \n Then she turned & entered the building, leaving a faint trail of flower scent behind as the only sign she'd even been here. \n \n \n The Howl started behind me, lamenting the passing of a Guardian, & the completion of a contract for a new one. Each Charge & Guardian slowly dropped out & returned to their Dens one by one until my Guardian & I were the only ones left in the street. \n \n \n His hand on my leash was firm, & he smelled of crisp winter air & hope.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The human species has gone extinct thousands of years ago . Extraterrestrial explorers find a sample of human DNA and decide to resurrect the species once again . You are the first new human growing up in a completely alien society .\n","story":"I was alone on a planet of ten billion beings. Sea'ca Park. There was s a great tree in the middle. The Jaicans cherish it. It's tall with big drooping vines of green and red. It's something out of a nightmare for me. But they play in it. Jaican mothers nurse their twins in its shade. Some of the bystanders eyed me with their all-pupil eyes, their black dead eyes. Others did n't seem to notice me at all. That was fitting. I am not Jaican. \n \n One of the Jaican women smiled at me. \n \n I should note here that most Jaican women are beautiful. Jaican women were green-skinned, to be sure, but they were universally tall, with the same humanoid features that my ancestors would have found... well, *attractive* is the only word for it. Damn attractive, with big curving hips and universally soft and bouncing breasts. Their eyes were strange, but they had hair, all of them, soft silky black hair that went down to their legs. \n \n I remembered the warning that Gerr gave me. Jaicans had a lovely, poetic way of talking, but when he said it, all of the words lagged in the air. `` Do *not* mate with Jaican.'' \n \n `` Why not?'' I said, eyeing one of the nurses who'd been tending to me. `` They seem perfectly humanoid to me.'' \n \n `` You understand no,'' Gerr said. `` Do *not* mate with Jaican. *I* mate with Jaican, never.'' \n \n The rest of adjusting to Jaican life had been pleasant, though most Jaicans ignored me as thought I were another one of their stray spider-dogs loose on the streets of Sea'ca'ii. They gave me an apartment after waking me out of the mechanical womb, told me to adjust, take my time. `` Adjust.'' Adjust to what? I was n't really a human being, was I? I'd never seen this distant planet earth. Sea'ca'ii was the only home I knew, Jaicans the only faces. Still, I'd been born with the instincts of a human man. I knew that when I grew hungry and spit out the terrible salty Sea'ca'ii seafood, or when I looked at a Jaican woman like the one who was now smiling at me. \n \n *Maybe Gerr warned me about Jaican women because they taste like the food. * \n \n `` You are Jaican no,'' she said. Holy shit. She was n't just beautiful. There was something otherworldly about her face even for a Jaican, the perfect contour of cheekbones, the way her pale blue lips looked plump and ready to kiss. `` You are human?'' \n \n `` So they tell me.'' \n \n When she sat on the bench next to me, I became acutely aware of the way she crossed her long legs, one over the other, hips facing me. *Gerr warned me about this. The blood to my crotch. * It was a frustrating feeling, to be sure. I'm not sure how any of my ancestors handled it. \n \n `` I, Leetra,'' she said, smiling. \n \n `` Leetra. I'm Kirkamron.'' \n \n `` This... Kirkamron... strange name.'' Her diction was terrible, but the way she said the words was nearly perfect, the way I'd say them. I'd been engineered and taught English, Gerr had said, the last of the great languages of Earth. Jaicans were nothing if not gracious hosts. This woman was another Jaican who had taken the time to download some of the lost languages of the galaxy for situations like this one. \n \n `` I was told he was a great religious figure where I come from,'' I said. `` When my people were wiped out by plague, it was Kirkamron who tried to unite them all in prayer.'' \n \n `` This Kirkamron, good name,'' Leetra decided. She sent a long, lean finger brushing my knee. \n \n `` I ca n't,'' I said. `` You're very beautiful, but... I'm not to mate with Jaican women.'' \n \n `` Mate? Who says we, mate?'' She smiled. `` I'll your friend, be your friend.'' She did n't lift the finger from my knee, though -- and I did n't want her to. `` I am thirsty. You have water in your home?'' \n \n I swallowed. `` Yes.'' \n \n `` You give Leetra water?'' \n \n `` I keep my apartment just a block away.'' \n \n She cooed, shooting her shoulders up and sending the top of her breasts heaving together. I nearly lost my breath. `` Good,'' she said. `` We go.'' \n \n The Jaicans left me an apartment with a view of their salt lake, which was so big it went all the way to the horizon. The apartment afforded little privacy; it was mostly window, and not tinted at that. The door was a window, the rooms were separated by windows. The only thing that was n't a window was the floor. Still, there was no privacy to be had; anyone on the beaches below could see us if they had the sudden urge to look up and see a Jaican woman leading a human by the hand. *I hope Gerr's not out there. * \n \n When we stepped in through the door I felt my breath leave me. Leetra was beautiful, and awakening some strange ancient part of me, which I suppose is a fancy way of saying I was already hard. Gerr had warned me against it, but part of me said *we're just friends, we're just here for now. * I could always kick her out. Jaicans were nothing if not polite. \n \n But as soon as I closed the door, Leetra pressed her body against me, and all of my rationalizations melted. \n \n `` You kiss,'' she said. Gerr had told me about Jaican women, about how wanton they were, but only said *do n't mate with them*. Maybe it meant I should n't get a Jaican woman pregnant. Maybe that's all he meant. If that's all he meant, maybe it was n't so bad, just this once. Besides, Gerr had n't told me how their muscular thighs would feel against me, how their big soft breasts felt against my own chest, the small nipples hard. She breathed on me with her blue lips and it smelled like hot mint. \n \n `` No,'' I said. \n \n `` Just kiss,'' she said, and she did. Her lips were so soft. The hot mint came rushing in, followed by a touch of her tongue. She stopped. `` You see? Just kiss. We friends.'' But her hand was in no-man's land, rubbing the hardness she found there, and I felt that strange rising dreamlike pleasure of something completely new awakening in me. \n \n `` Come here,'' I said, by way of stopping her. I led her by the hand to the couch. *If we're near the window, I'll be able to stop myself. * I did n't want people to see. It was clear that Leetra was too beautiful to resist without that kind of assistance. \n \n But she sat on my lap. \n \n I pushed her away. \n \n She giggled. `` This game, we play. You feel better, no? If you remove clothes?'' \n \n *Damnit, * I thought, as I pulled my pants down. *Damnit, damnit, damnit. * But I kept the underclothes on. It still was n't mating if I had the underclothes on. \n \n It felt like it, though, when she dropped onto my lap and started grinding on me, through the underclothes. Suddenly *she* started moaning, as if anyone could feel any more pleasure than I could at that moment. I felt something new coming, a strange feeling of arousal that they'd warned me about, and knew the seed was coming. I pushed her off. \n \n She giggled again. `` Is okay,'' she said. `` We just play.'' She removed what little clothes she had left on, and started grinding again. Again I felt that feeling rise up, only now I did n't care. Then she stopped and turned around. `` You remove clothes,'' she said. `` I not make you seed. We just play.'' \n \n *Okay, * I finally thought. *We're doing this. * \n \n Now she sat on me and we were well and truly fucking, and it was only after she started shouting and moaning loudly that I remembered that people from the outside could see. I glimpsed outside and saw a small crowd gathering. *No, * I thought. *If this gets back to Gerr... * But by then I did n't care. She was gorgeous from this angle, with a wide apple bottom and thin waist and big bouncing breasts; there was no way even a human back in my own species could have been this beautiful. I was about to come. \n \n Then the pain started. \n \n Something inside her -- it felt like teeth -- clenched around my manhood, and I let out a cry. \n \n `` This not take long,'' she said. She wriggled her hips and leapt off my lap, and I let out a horrific scream. I felt it -- the sudden jarring pain of tearing, and then the feeling that something was missing. \n \n She'd torn it off. From the inside of her body. \n \n Blood spattered. Outside, the crowd started pointing. Some were... laughing? I could n't tell. I saw red. I felt down to my crotch, feverishly searching for the manhood that was n't there. Then came another shot of pain, this time on my shoulder. \n \n Another Jaican woman was biting on it. A third one leaped over and wrestled me to the couch. \n \n Then another bite. The ankle. Leetra had torn out a chunk of flesh. \n \n A fourth bite. My fingers. I screamed, and this time the screaming did n't stop. I thought of Gerr, and his warning, but soon the world went black. \n \n\n"}

Slowly, the fragments of remembrance broke away from my heart, melting away into the atmosphere until I could no longer recall the first time she looked at me. \n \n I had taken it for granted, just like I had taken her for granted. And now all I had left was the ability to bask in the glow of the memories, just as I had basked in the glow of her presence. Everything I could ever think of came back to her. When I walked outside and felt the warm glow of the sun, I remembered how warm it felt to feel her lips against mine. I never drank tea before she came along, but that all changed when she made me a warm mug of... what was it... some sort of green? No, it was a purple hue. No, that ca n't be right... why ca n't I remember... \n \n At night sometimes, I lay awake and think of her. How it used to feel when she would curl up by my side. But lately my thoughts have been growing less and less vivid; I ca n't remember the smell of her shampoo, or the phrase we used to say to each other before we went to sleep. I've tried to steer my thoughts away to something else, in an effort to preserve the moments I have left; save them for times when I really need them, or times when I simply do n't want to think of anything else. But that's the problem; I do n't want to think about anything else. And I know if I do n't stop there will come a day when I can no longer recall the brightness of her cobalt stare... no, it was jade. Beautiful green eyes, that when you looked into them, you were taken away to a luminous paradise. \n \n Her. \n \n But once I start to remember, I ca n't stop. A flood of color envelopes me in a breeze I ca n't fight, and all of her comes back. I can see her in front of me. But each time her glow dwindles, and more of her starts to fade. And my heart gets a little lighter, but not in a good way. My heart lightens because there is less of her in it. And when she leaves, she takes pieces of me with her. Maybe when I remember her for the last time, she'll take the last piece of me with her.\n"}

You are the strongest superhero in your age group , but believe you have been assigned to the weakest hero . You learn a lot more than you originally thought you would .\n","story":"I'm so excited right now. There are plenty of super hero groups running around but the Justice Alliance is number one. Everyone knows them and they tackle the world's biggest threats. They're pretty much legends and I get to have the chance to join them. Hell, I did n't even know they take in new members, much less newbies like me! But then again, I'm one of the best among the rookies! \n \n Most heroes and hopeful heroes have a gimmick, that one special thing that makes them capable of being a super hero. But me, I'm different. I'm just like Hero. He's got super strength, super speed, super senses, flight, and all around invincibility. Not as flashy as the others but he's probably the strongest being on earth, the very first super hero to make his name and probably the only super hero who has never wavered. Some super heroes go bad, some give up, some are just too broken to continue but not him. He's always there to be the beacon of hope for humanity and people are already likening me to him just from a couple of my appearances! \n \n My thoughts are broken by a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and there he was. The man, no, a god that I looked up to ever since I was a child, before I even realized my powers. We pretty much have the same body posture, stood at the same height and by various sources estimations, we have the same strength in just about every super hero attributes they can match us to. Yet here I am, startruck and feeling small and feeling like I have to look up to see his face. I do n't believe I can win against him if we were to fight right now. I'm younger and more spry but he's got 20 years of experience on his belt. \n \n `` Welcome to our base, young man. We hope that you'll make a good addition to this team.'' said Hero, as he extended his hand for a handshake. I reciprocated but was unprepared for Hero's grip. Such strength! He does n't even look like he's trying! \n \n `` I hope so. I look forward to your guidance.'' I replied, barely able to contain my excitement. \n \n `` Excellent. I wo n't be the one who will mentor you, however'' \n \n His answer took me aback. Who? Who else could mentor me other than Hero? Many people are hoping for me to take after Hero. he should be the one to teach me! I could n't think straight and blurted out `` Who's gon na be my teacher then?'' \n \n `` This person has guided me through out my life. Without the guidance they provided, I could have been just another super powered criminal. Everything that I am now, is thanks to that person.'' answered my hero. \n \n I ca n't stop thinking now. I've never heard of this. Who could this be? Oh dammit. I blurted out that last question! I was still thinking! But yeah, might as well hear his answer. \n \n `` My mother.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Stories from the end of the world as we know it\n","story":"Earth was never an end, and when it died we had only begun. The end will arrive at a strange distance in time and space, when the planet Vestige orbits a dying red dwarf and its night sky is empty but for seven stars. The stars will have no names, for the same reason that the farmers of Earth had nameless cattle. \n \n The heat death of the universe will be a slow and brutal and lonely event. Those that endure the end of things will know that things are ending, and the knowledge will be useless. There will be no final epiphany, no answer for entropy, no magical spark in the darkness. Things will simply cease to be. Something must always become nothing. \n \n At the edge of time there will only be one way to look. Without a future there is only a past and the conscious beings of Vestige will look up at the seven stars of night and they will remember. Their mothers and fathers told of nights with ten stars, whose parents spoke of twelve and even some that knew thirteen. The annals of Vestige will claim that a hundred fiery orbs still burned over the cosmic horizon when the planet was chosen. And far away through the impossible fields of time a thousand stars once burned - and a million - and a *billion*. Once upon a time in the golden age of existence there were so many stars that they filled the sky and could never be counted. People bathed in stars and painted with them and drew stories across the universe. \n \n Vestige will look up at its own sky, dark with seven stars, and wonder that such people existed, and whether they reckoned their paradise. \n \n And a night will come and one of the seven stars will go out. Vestige will weep beneath the passage of time and another star will die and then another until the seven stars of night are dead and the red dwarf of day is dying. The last bits of a consciousness born in furnaces of pressure and time will huddle for warmth and wait for the embers to become the past. \n \n And *I* will turn to *you* and smile. Not because I'm happy and not because you're special but because we *are*. To be is to have been and consciousness is the formless tide of all remembrance. I will crash upon those shores and I will see the dying sun and I will know that yours was a face beneath a billion stars. We will fade away together, and we will fade laughing, laughing for the paradise that beggared us. \n \n *** \n \n I submit this with an apology. It was supposed to be about aliens. \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] One day , you find a mysterious box . The letters on it read 'Conquer-the-World Kit ' .\n","story":"Joe and Dana Hillsborough stood in their doorway, watching their son playing in the driveway. Both stared with open mouths, each shooting the other worried glances from time to time. \n \n Dana cleared her throat. `` Chris!'' She shouted to their seven-year old. `` Do you want to come in for a snack?'' \n \n Chris turned to his mother with a gap-toothed grin. `` Not right now, Mom! Thanks!'' Wearing a silver plastic Pickelhelm, he looked like a little Otto von Bismark. He turned back to the troops assembled across their driveway, their front lawn, their neighbor's driveway, their neighbor's front lawn, in the street, the lawn across the -- well, pretty much the whole neighborhood. They were all dressed in grim grey uniforms, and here and there one held one of the flags that Chris had drawn that afternoon with his crayons: an astronaut with machine-guns for arms. \n \n `` What was in that box?'' Joe asked. \n \n His wife shook her head. `` I do n't know, he took it out there with him. I mean, it had that hat in it, I know that much.'' \n \n `` Pickelhelm,'' Joe said. \n \n `` Whatever! I -- I'm going to tell him to come inside. This has gone on long enough.'' \n \n `` And what about them?'' Joe waved at the tight ranks of soldiers that stretched away down the block. \n \n `` I do n't know, they can -- they can go home, or whatever.'' Dana screwed up her face, puzzled. `` Where did these guys even *come* from?'' \n \n `` Not *all* guys, honey. That whole squad of grenadiers is women.'' \n \n Outside, Chris was rooting around in the box. He came up with a slip of paper, stood up on the trunk of Dana's car, and began to shout at his troops. `` All through your army career you men have bitched about what you call'this chicken-shit drilling.' \n \n `` That is all for a purpose\u2014to ensure instant obedience to orders and to create constant alertness. This must be bred into every soldier.

But his troops were all cheering, pumping fists and rifles into the air. \n \n `` Look,'' Joe said, `` let me go out there and get him. You're right, fun's over.'' \n \n But Chris was already trotting up to them, head down. `` Mom, I'm sorry that I cussed.'' He took his Pickelhelm off and held it in both hands. `` I do n't want to play anymore, anyways. This game is boring. Can we...'' He stuttered. `` Can we go out for pizza?'' \n \n She looked down at her son and smiled. `` Aw, sure.'' \n \n `` Go hop in the car,'' Joe said. `` We'll be there in a minute.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Aliens visit earth , but they find round things scary\n","story":"The first months were the most shocking ones, afterwards everything calmed down, albeit slowly. \n \n The `` aliens'' as we called them at first were very clearly related to us biologically. At least some of them. Some others were completely different, but we did n't meet many of those for obvious reasons. The first step to building a good relationship was learning and teaching our respective languages, albeit they were quite familiar with our earthly tongues. So our groups were mostly taught Amambwe, Lysano, and Thindlurrinni, three of the most common languages of the newcomers. \n \n `` Whatever is the reason they are visiting us?'' Anne asked me. \n `` We do n't know yet,'' I replied. Although I had pondered that for quite too long, I could n't really come to a conclusion. They were n't threatening, they were n't exchanging information -other than linguistic ones, that is. Their coming was unknown to us, but welcome they were. \n \n Not that we did n't have groups of nut-jobs walking around the streets demonstrating. But if they had met the `` aliens'' face to face, they'd feel otherwise. These ones were almost exactly like humans, but they radiated an otherworldiness that ca n't be put down to words. Was it their scrutinising gaze? The fact that they smiled too much? The fact that they could speak our languages almost perfectly? \n \n `` Is everything going alright?'' Ansemi asked me. \n \n `` Oh, you startled me!'' I replied. `` Yeah, everything's fine.'' \n \n The way these... _people? _ Sure. The way these people could creep up on you was uncanny. They almost made no sound whatsoever. \n \n `` I did n't mean to'' he said in Lyseno. \n \n `` It is okay,'' I replied in my broken speech which he did n't mock. \n \n `` Lilly,'' he said, `` I wanted to ask you something. \n \n `` Only if you let me ask you something in return'' I said. \n \n `` You know I'm not allowed. Not yet.'' \n \n `` Yeah, I know'' I sighed. `` Sure, ask me.'' I could feel Anne's gaze from across the room. \n \n `` Would you like to _asswinnento_ with me?'' \n \n `` To what?'' I did n't know that word. \n \n `` To go out with me. To have a date.'' \n \n I pondered for a second. \n \n `` I do n't think it would be...'' \n \n `` Before you refuse, I have an offer to make. If you come, I'll answer as many questions as I can. It's not much, I know. But it will definitely be more than you already know now.'' \n \n His smile was disarming. \n \n ___ \n \n Three hours later, we were sitting in a small restaurant near my university, with small round tables and cozy colours. Whether the music playing was lounge or some kind of jazz, I could n't tell. \n \n Ansemi was handsome as ever, and his attire was impeccable, if only a bit overdressed. Or was _I_ the one who thought this would be more casual. \n `` So, Lilly,'' he said and drank a sip of wine, `` I guess you have many questions, but so do I. I hope you do n't mind.'' \n \n `` Not at all,'' I said, as long as you provide me with enough info. \n \n `` Shall I go first?'' I said. He nodded. `` Are humans and your people related?'' \n \n `` Yes, indeed. We are very closely related.'' \n \n `` Is panspermia correct?'' \n \n `` That I do not know, but it might as well be. Now it's my turn. Do you like me?'' \n \n `` Oh, blunt. Alright, I can play that game.'' I smiled. `` Well --'' \n \n `` Are you ready to order?'' asked the young waitress. \n \n `` Beef tartare, smoked cheddar, chestnut,'' Ansemi said. \n \n I was about to order a cheeseburger, but with that I changed my mind. \n `` I'll have the same, thanks.'' \n \n `` So,'' sighs Ansemi with a big bright smile. \n \n `` Yes. Indeed, I ca n't deny that you're a good-looking fella,'' I reply, without actually answering his question. But it seems it's enough for him. \n \n `` Did you come to destroy us or take us out for expensive dinners?'' I asked. \n He laughed. `` We did n't come to destroy you, no. We have come to build an alliance between our people and yours. And of course, we'll help you technologically.'' \n \n `` But you'll want something in return.'' \n \n `` Naturally,'' he said, `` but whether or not you do help us, we'll still help you and our alliance wo n't change nonetheless.'' \n \n `` May I ask what it is that you're after?'' \n \n `` This is confidential.'' \n \n `` I shall never speak of it.'' \n \n `` Our people can not reproduce. We shall ask your people's representatives for reproductive cells. We know you already donate male cells, so I do n't think it would be that much of a deal.'' \n \n `` I do n't think so either,'' I frown, `` but then how did you come into being?'' \n `` My turn to make a question,'' he smiled. `` Have you ever been married?'' \n `` Yes. Once. It did n't last. He was a bastard.'' \n \n You looked at me quizzically. \n \n `` I kid! I mean, I was married, yes. But he was n't a bastard. It just did n't work out. We were too young and too carrier-driven to even notice that our marriage was falling apart. Until, we did. So we ended it.'' \n \n He nodded. \n \n His questions were always intimate. Mine were never that. So I changed my tactic. \n \n `` Do you have a family back there, on your planet?'' \n \n `` No, not really. I have a clan though,'' he said. `` A clan of brothers and sisters. Most of them work as farmers now though.'' \n \n `` What do they do there, make _crop circles? `` _ I asked, saying the last word in English, for I did n't think there might be an equivalent. \n \n `` Excuse me?'' he asked. \n \n `` Oh, I'm sorry,'' I said, I did n't mean to offend.'' \n \n `` No, I mean. I do n't know that word.'' \n \n Curious, I wondered. The derivation was obvious, crop + circle. His English was exceptional. So, I try to improvise. \n \n `` You know, like _vistammyne,'' _ I said, quite literally,'round thing'. `` Vistammyne on field crops.'' \n \n For the first time he lost his smile. `` What do you know about those? Where did you get this information?'' \n \n `` What do you mean?'' I asked, kinda scared. \n \n The waitress comes with our dishes. No one thanked her, despite her politeness. \n \n `` I'm not sure what you're asking,'' I said. `` I just made a joke, but I'm sorry if I offended you.'' \n \n `` How do you know about vistammyne? Who told you?'' \n \n `` No one told me! Crop circles have been a pop culture thing in like forever!'' I reply in English, so that I could make sure none of my words would be interpreted any differently from what I'd intended. \n \n `` Are you serious?'' he asked. \n \n I take out my iPhone, google `` crop circles'' and show him the picture results. \n `` I -- I have to go!'' he replied and left me there. The alien just had a case of Runaway Bride. \n \n At least the beef was good.\n"}

You 're informed that no one knows how to take it apart or even open it . You touch the door of the spaceship , and suddenly it opens .\n","story":"I entered the isolated room, its size foreboding on me like I was a dwarf. All along the walls dotted several different computers, each one tasked with some different use, each one getting the humans no further to opening the spaceships hull. \n \n I was just an average smart person, working for cancer research uk I had made several breakthroughs, none of which were the cure of course, but breakthroughs nonetheless. It was 3 in the morning when the call came through. `` Mr. Smith, we have a proposal for you, one of magnificent proportions and huge prospects.'' I squinted, my eyes still straining for the appropriate level of light as that darned street lamp from outside cast its wondrous glow in my eyes. \n \n `` Who is this? how did you get my number? and its Doctor! not Mr!'' \n \n `` Mr. Smith.'' The voice said, practically telling me it wont give in to my demands so easily. `` This is a top secret government agency, and you have been selected amongst millions to be part of our top secret investigation.'' \n \n `` What top secret government agency? What top secret investigation?'' I had sat up now, the curiosity had been touched, although it sounded like one of those prank calls you would get from people attempting to collect your bank details. \n \n `` All will become clear to you, all you have to say is *yes* and you will be contractually obliged to do as we say, that includes not confessing the truth of this phone call to anyone. You are being recorded, so do n't think you can back out on your word either... let's just say it involves... other life.'' I was so confused, if I said yes it could mean anything, but my life was so boring... nobody seemed to appreciate me at work and, wait... did she say *other life*? was she implying aliens? whats the worst that could happen? A lot of things really... but I did n't get this far without taking risks. \n \n `` Er... ok.'' I said to them, hitting myself mentally that I did n't say yes, you're meant to sound confident and in control not submissive. \n \n `` We need a yes, Mr. Smith.'' \n \n `` Yes.'' I said almost instantly, god dammit. \n \n `` Great Dr. Smith! be ready in 2 hours and we'll have a car waiting for you outside your house, the journey is quite a while so you'll be able to sleep in the car. The windows are blacked out anyway as our location is top secret.'' I was starting to regret this already. The phone went dead. Well that's charming, guess I may as well get up now and get ready lest I oversleep. \n \n That was a few hours ago, it was now 3pm in... well I do n't know where that journey was indeed rather long. Still in the country though, did n't need a plane. Unless we embarked a ferry without my knowing. I took the room in, it was too massive to comprehend really. There was n't many staff here to say how big the room was, I guess it was as secret as they said. `` Doctor Smith.'' A womans voice next to me called out. I turned to see a woman in her mid 40's ( ish ) looking very stern and serious looking in a nice crease-less suit, if I were 30 years younger... \n \n `` Ah, the woman on the phone I presume?'' I asked, not actually remembering what she sounded like. \n \n `` Yes, of course. Now you must understand that you can not speak about this to anyone, not even your wife or your children. Not your closest friend or your neighbors dogs former owners maids uncle, got it?'' What? \n \n `` er... sure, whats the secret anyway?'' She walked away from me as if she did n't hear my question. \n \n `` Follow me, and mind where you're walking we have lots of... devices on the prowl.'' She did n't look back at me when she spoke, she seemed very sure of herself. I followed her, she was leading me to a big tent in the middle of the room, I wondered what it was obscuring. Eventually we made it inside, and what was inside was phenomenal. It was a huge spaceship, at least to the humans it was huge. It was dark purple in colour and had lots of random straight lines running around it which seemed like small rectangular crevices in the ships structure, did they serve a purpose or were they just decorative? either way they had white light zipping through them like electricity moving from one place to another, perhaps an element we do not know about. \n \n `` Stop gawking, follow me.'' What was going on? this was too much. \n \n `` Wait.'' I said sternly, it seemed to work as she stopped. `` What is this? is this a joke? what do you need me for?'' \n \n `` This is not a joke, this spacecraft was found here 12 years ago and we built this building around it to obscure it from satellites, locals and tourists. We picked you because you are smart, unbelievably smart. Nobody has ever done so much for the battle against cancer as you have.'' Well I was n't expecting answers that easily. `` I see you seemed quite surprised at my response, we exercise full disclosure in this work environment. Full transparency to avoid any conspiracy theories against the staff and for a full diagnostic on whatever this thing is, no data goes unmissed as far as I'm aware of. It's important to let the staff feel comfortable and safe, that way moral is higher and work is quicker and more efficient.'' She talked too much, at my age it was hard to keep track of what she was saying. \n \n `` Ok.'' I responded. \n \n `` That's it?'' She asked, surprised. \n \n `` Yes.'' I said, `` Actually no, why exactly do you need me again?'' \n \n `` We are trying to open it, we ca n't. So we're bringing in all the smartest brains from around the world to figure it out, so far no luck.'' She seemed disappointed. \n \n `` Well thats a bummer.'' I said uncaring, yes it was interesting but I just wanted to see inside, I did n't want to actually have to *work* with this thing. She raised an eyebrow at me. \n \n `` Perhaps your insight into anatomy and biology may be useful, we're not sure how it operates and microbes, bacteria and all that stuff may be the answer. It's a long shot, but we're trying all angles.'' Jeez does she ever shut up? \n \n `` You talk too much.'' There were audible gasps from around the room, clearly nobody was brave enough to stand up to this woman. \n \n `` Mr. Smith! we operate a tight leash here and we will not accept insubordination of any degree! do you understand?!'' Was she still talking? \n \n `` Yes yes.'' I said now concentrating on the ship. I went to touch it when she spoke again. \n \n `` We've already tried that, we tried everything. Sheer force and pressure dont seem to budge it, we ca n't even chip it to get a sample of the element it uses.'' She finally stopped talking and I went back to touch it. My hand light pressed down on the hull of the ship and the white zipping light vanished along with a powering down sound, everyone gasped again. Nothing works huh? I thought to myself. \n \n There was a momentary pause, then a slight hissing sound like some hydraulics. *Heh, highly technologically advanced aliens and they use hydraulics. * An outline of a door appeared where I touched the ship and a set of stairs came down with it. There was suddenly lots of shouting and my ears struggled to comprehend all the noises, some men with big guns grabbed me and shoved me to the ground telling me to not move and keep my hands where they can see them. I'm 75 years old! What am I gon na do hit them with my walking stick? perhaps my zimmer frame is a secret nuclear warhead. 3 men surrounded me, making sure I did n't move when all of a sudden they all flew back and harmlessly landed on the floor. In the door of the ship appeared a being, a human being. Ok it was n't a human being but I ca n't be bothered to describe it, it was n't anything like we've ever imagined, not that martian crap anyway. \n \n `` Hello.'' It said, it spoke english? `` We have been monitoring your kind for some time now, we have learnt your ways and your language and we have been waiting dormant for your kind to simply calm down. We have used this spaceship as a teleporter of sorts, where we would check up on you every 6 months. Your kind only seems to degrade itself the more time you are given, because of this we decided we would only take one of you with us. Someone worthy enough to be considered'nice' as you humans like to put it.'' He\/she whatever gender it was if it was a gender looked at me and my gawking face. `` Would you like to come with us? Doctor Smith?'' I was glad it used the word Doctor. `` We will take you on many journeys, many adventures, many places where you can experience wonderful and amazing sights, exquisite tastes and other... *desires*.'' That sounded wonderful, but why me? \n \n `` But im an old man! I'll be dead soon perhaps you should pick one of these younger doctors?'' Not that I deemed any of them worthy enough myself. \n \n `` No, we will make you young again, for as long as you desire. We'll even give you the cure to cancer before you leave, does that sound good to you?'' Hell yeah. \n \n `` Hell yeah.'' I said exactly what I was thinking, it was time to say bye. `` Bye guys!'' I shouted to everyone before I walked on the ship. There was a bright glow and before I knew it I was being shot through the stars and space while my skin got more youthful by the second. I was going on an adventure, and I'll never be back. \n \n _____ \n \n Read more stories at \/r\/inooxwritings particularly my ongoing series'Hellspawn'\n"}

Well, in multiple worse shapes... got ta stop thinking about it, looking down at all the bits of yourself can get you a little queasy. \n \n I was expecting the long line, the wait for eternity - after all, is n't there like an African kid dying every second? And everyone else, too, so if they all have to be judged, right? And what about that judgement? Would this or that matter, which religions I followed ( or paid lip service to, or thought about in moments of agony... ) \n \n No, it was easier than that. We imagined it like the DMV beyond the pale; we always forget that omnipotent means *omnipotent*. That omnipresent means everywhere, everywhen. \n \n So not like some DMV waiting for eternity, or even a business like interview of your life - just a sitting room, comfortably familiar, with a... person, you've spoken to your entire life, even if you have n't realized it. Warm, friendly, safe. The tension gone, the rat race ended, time to unwind. Then, the choice. \n \n We were all given it; a door that would lead us to the perfect world, a place where our minds controlled the environment as flawlessly as his own; we would be as child-gods, and some day we would create our own universe, and someday beyond that, have a fraction of our being sit along with an intelligent creature and ask it how it *thinks* it's life went. \n \n Or there was the other door, back up. To universes that have already come, and gone, and are still going; to witness Gods that spawned Gods that spawned Gods... and be greeted as an equal, an observer of everything that has been, will be, can be. And, it was hinted, if we played our cards right, get another chance at life, to try again and learn something from it. \n \n It was the last door that caught my attention. The first was gaudy, gold trimmed and fluted and... I ca n't describe it, there are no words, only raw emotion being endlessly teased on itself, beckoning with the billions that have gone before me, learning what it means to be everybody's everything. The second door, silvered and wood and stern, but inviting, like a library's door. Built to withstand the enormous pressure within and without. \n \n The last door was bare metal, with a chrome pushbar handle and a dirty riveted metal kickboard. The others glowed with potential - this, only by the dim rusty red light hanging above it. \n \n > EXIT \n \n Even God seemed a bit... unnerved, by that door. I asked him what lay beyond, and he just motioned to the sign again. Without having to worry about living, the brain can pick up quite the pace. \n \n Out. \n \n Exit. \n \n Log off. \n \n The End. \n \n The other doors were continuing life, by other means. But even in a universe, within a universe, within untold infinity of universes, there was an outside. Uncreation. The last, true death, the death of Gods. \n \n In some universes, where the stars have dimmed or the hearts of the sentient have wearied under burdens too heavy to bear, they have chosen that door. And with each one who did so, more would inevitably follow until the universe ran dry. Even in healthy universes, there's the odd jaded soul who would eventually decide it was time to stop experiencing. \n \n I asked if anyone had ever chosen that, from our world. \n \n No one came close to it. \n \n We're an odd bunch. One in millions, not particularly fast or smart or strong, when our creators could have endowed us with so much He chose to give us little. And when those who were given untold power discovered any limit, they broke as one. \n \n But mankind found our limits, and kept finding ways over them, around them, under them; how to harness even our weaknesses and deficiencies and turn them into strengths. And when it came time to choose, we never see the total freedom offered us and resent it, or feel constrained after having been blessed with too much. \n \n At least, that's my theory. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go; a little extra solar radiation in the right place will give my chosen lineage endless strength and endurance, and I ca n't wait to see what door they'll pick when they realize what truly unlimited power looks like.\n"}

Just then, his scar split as if lashed by a cracking whip. \n \n *Have you learned nothing in my absence, Potter? * \n \n The terrifying voice seemed to issue from all corners of the room. A whirling wind threw open the windows, howling like a pack of wolves. The candles died. The fire roared in the wind and was extinguished. The moonlight through the window had faded. Harry fell out of his chair on his knees and grabbed his trusty old wand so tight that his hard old knuckles gleamed white. This could not be happening. Yet suddenly it all made sense: the dull itch that had squirmed in his forgotten scar for months, his grandchildren's recurring nightmares, the disappearances. \n \n *Oh yes. I waited - until the years murdered you. * \n \n Harry's books went flying. Albus' owl shrieked and took off. He felt a stinging pain in his chest. \n \n `` You are dead,'' he wheezed, `` You're dead.'' \n \n *I am dead*, the voice admitted. \n \n And out of the darkness he came.

They saw the scene, the dread spectre raised its predatory head and something eerily like a wand appeared in its hand - `` EXPECTO PATRONUM'' - twin animals exploded against the abomination and it was thrown through the window into the street where it dispersed like fog. Harry's broken form lay shuddering in the ravaged room. Ginny knelt next to him and jammed her wand so hard against his chest she heard one of the old ribs crack. \n \n `` Vulnera sanentur.'' \n \n `` What was that, mum?'' \n \n Her eyes were wild, her lips moved with short syllables, spell upon spell of healing.

An owl travelling at great speed which more crashed than landed into Ron's chair, sending his pipe flying. \n \n `` Blimey! Alright alright, sit still you bloody bird.'' \n \n The owl was insane, Ron concluded, taking the hard fought letter into his badly scratched hands.

Your cousin , whom you have n't seen since your youth , comes to town to visit . As the door opens , your dog suddenly whispers in your ear : `` run . ''\n","story":"I felt frozen. \n \n My cousin Beth opened her arms and yelled, `` Surprise! I hope you do n't mind me letting myself in, I remembered where you keep the spare and figured I'd try to sneak up on you.'' She explained with a laugh. \n \n I shook off my surprise and shot a look at the seat next to me where Coot was now laying. He let out a huff and grumbled to his feet. \n \n Coot was old when we first adopted him years ago. The shelter said he had been found wandering along a country road, probably dumped there by his family instead of paying the fee at the shelter to relinquish him. Happens a lot out here. But he's a good dog. Easy going. Lovable. But old as dirt and rickety. \n \n So when the serum did n't lead to long chats about life on the front porch and a deeper connection forged through communication we all laughed and figured you really could n't teach an old dog new tricks. \n \n The cat though. That was a mistake. Should have known not to do that. Remy was bossy as hell and ornery to boot. And we always wondered what he'd be up yowling about all night. Curiosity killed the cat I guess. Remy's just an asshole that likes screaming at night. It's unsettling is what it is. \n \n But back to the point, we figured ol' Coot was one of the few animals that the serum did n't take to. Did n't make us love him any less. And with the way Remy talked, I was actually a little relieved about it. So when I moved out, I took Coot with me and we've lived in blissful silence ever since. \n \n And suddenly, it clicked. \n \n Beth hadnt seen me or Coot since I moved out of my parents place. \n \n She should n't know about the key. \n \n `` Beth! Long time no see! You should have called! You see your mom yet?'' I blurted out as I jumped up from the couch and practically sprinted over to meet her at the door. \n \n Beth looked surprised and relieved. \n \n `` No, not yet. But I wanted to see how my favorite cousin was doing first!'' She explained, starting to take off her coat. I stopped her. \n \n `` I was just about to go see her actually! It's Friday, you know we all get together down at The Skillet for dinner.'' I said, only lying a little, as I had no intention of going because I had actually been planning on watching Steven Universe with Coot then playing on my phone until I fell asleep. \n \n `` Oh well, alright.'' She said, a little disappointed sounding as she looked over at Coot. \n \n I ushered her out the door, `` Let's drive together. We can catch up along the way!'' I offered, stupidly. \n \n `` Great idea!'' She said, flipping her dark blonde hair over her shoulder and reaching into her bag for her car keys. \n \n As we drove across town to the little diner my family went to on Friday nights, Beth babbled endlessly about what she had been doing all these years away. College then work, moving around a bit, trying to make a comfortable life. No boyfriend lasted more than a year though. She lamented that fact. They all claimed one flaw or another and broke up with her. \n \n Thinking back on Coot's fearful advise I really hoped she had n't murdered any of them or something. \n \n When we arrived, the family greeted her with hoots and hollers and a whole line of hugs. \n \n I wo n't detail the whole reunion, just the pertinent bits. There was really only one area of conversation that left me feeling worried and a little sick. \n \n While everyone was talking about something else, my Aunt Gerty leaned over and confided that she was so glad Beth had decided to visit because she thought she never would after what happened at the lake. \n \n The lake. \n \n The fucking lake. \n \n `` When Beth found that Parsons girl drowned she was never really the same. Left town as soon as she graduated. Her mother always told me Beth felt so guilty about not being able to help her friend. Not being able to get help soon enough. I'm glad she's doing better now.'' \n \n I remember that day at the lake. The family had all gotten together to shoot off fireworks and have a huge barbecue. My family is big on traditions and the 4th of July get together is one of our biggest of the year because no one tsks at you for getting drunk and wearing next to nothing. It's a family favorite. \n \n That year, Beth had invited Karin Parsons. Best friends since middle school. Thick as theives. Inseparable. \n \n Karin and Beth had wandered away from the main part of the shore to go do secretive best friend shit and the next thing we knew Uncle Jeb has shut off the music and was telling people he heard screaming. \n \n We all kind of grudgingly listen and try to find out where it's coming from. \n \n My dad was the one who found Beth on the shore, screaming and crying. Karin has drowned and her body was out floating towards the middle of the lake. \n \n Everyone had said it was an accident. Everyone. My family. The police. \n \n And when my dad found her she had n't been alone. Sitting there on the shore. Barking like mad. Was Coot. \n \n The serum was a miracle. Everyone knew about it and it was all anyone talked about. About how animals could tell us what they wanted and needed, what they were feeling, what they remembered. \n \n I needed to save him. \n \n `` Hey Uncle Jeb, tell Beth what that old hound of yours said last week! She'll get a kick outta it!'' I piped up over the din. \n \n And Uncle Jeb gleefully relayed to story of how Birch had given him a long talking to about eating jerky in front of him and not sharing any of it. \n \n `` I laughed myself silly over that one. But I'll be damned if I do n't give him a little every time I got some!'' he said and everyone had a good chuckle, and just like I'd hoped he mentioned Coot. \n \n `` Shame though about the serum not working on Ol' Coot. That damn dog's probably old enough to tell us about what kind of kibble Noah brought on the Ark.'' he said with a wink. \n \n I laughed too, hiding the panic that was surfacing, `` I talked with the Vet and they said some animals are just too old or not smart enough. Coot is pretty sharp, but he's getting up there in years. Does n't bother me none.'' \n \n `` Aw. That's so sad. Coot's my favorite. I would have liked to see what he had to say. You sure he ca n't talk?'' Beth asked, looking to my eyes like a death row inmate who was just handed a pardon. \n \n `` Pretty damn sure. Lawn caught fire a few months back. Darn dog just howled and started causing a ruckus out back. Went out to check and there he is, just barking like crazy. Coulda lost the house. If there was any time to talk, that would have been the time. He's a good dog though. Got my attention any way.'' I said. \n \n I was lying of course. There had been a little fire in the backyard but I had been the one outside hollering and Coot had been inside enjoying the AC. Probably for the best though, I do n't think Coot would been able to work the garden hose like I can. \n \n And just like that, the topic was closed. \n \n Beth left a few days later and I moved the key somewhere inconspicuous in the back yard. \n \n Now I'm not saying what I did was right. But the only witness to the crime was a 20 year old coon dog and he has n't said a damn thing since. \n \n Be they animal or human, I take care of me and mine. And this is just one of those things.\n"}

Out of habit he attempted to roll onto his stomach but found his coordination nonexistent. *What is wrong with me? *, he thought to himself, as he twitched and flailed about, letting out the occasional grunt of frustration. *Oh right, * he remembered, *I had to do a transfer. * Almost on cue Jarkin awoke. The spherical floating robot glided over to his bedside. `` Good morning sire.'' it greeted him. `` How are you adjusting to your new body?'' \n \n `` mhph, ker-guh'' Kall could only manage to spew out a few unintelligible syllables while attempting to focus on his personal assistant, his eyes seemingly having a mind of their own. \n \n `` Do you require a motor skills injection?'' Jarkin inquired. \n \n `` Phmph-uhh'' Kall managed to get out. \n \n `` I believe that is a yes.'' The robot remarked, almost snidely. \n \n A metal arm extended from Jarkin, tipped with a sharp needle, and was plunged into the back of Kall's neck. Kall could feel the fluid being injected, and after it was withdrawn he waited a few moments for it to take affect. \n \n With a previously absent grace and athleticism Kall sprung from the bed, landing easily on his feet. He stretched, leaning back and spreading his arms out to the side as far as he could. `` Ooh.'' he moaned as he felt his joints pop. `` It's been awhile since I've had an endoskeleton.'' \n \n `` 192 years, sire.'' Jarkin chimed in. \n \n Kall walked over to where his previous body lay, thrown in a heap in a corner like usleless garbage. He nudged one of the large insectoid limbs with his foot. `` I'm not gon na lie, being a Skraaken was n't that bad. But it is nice to be a mammal again.'' He looked down at himself. `` And to only have to worry about two feet. What am I by the way?'' He walked over to a mirror that was against one wall. `` Oh, a human, that's interesting. Did n't they just become part of the empire?'' \n \n `` Yes sire,'' Jarkin responded. `` Humans were officially inducted into the empire 1.4 years ago and are the newest addition.'' \n \n `` So Jarkin,'' Kall started, as he continued to examine himself in the mirror. `` What can you tell me about this body?'' \n \n Jarkin was quiet for a moment as it brought up it's files. `` You are a human, sometimes referred to as homo-sapien. You are an omnivorous mammal. This body was speed grown to an approximate age of 23 years, and is 6 foot 1 inches tall and weighs around 193 pounds. And, per your request two transfers ago, you are male.'' \n \n Kall glanced over at a large colorful painting on the wall. `` I can see three primary colors?'' \n \n `` Yes sire.'' Jarkin confirmed. `` Red, yellow, and blue.'' \n \n `` How long can I expect this body to last?'' \n \n `` The oldest known human lived to be 122 years, but most, in a healthy environment, only live to their 70's or 80's.'' \n \n Kall turned to look at Jarkin. `` You're telling me, I only have 50 to 60 years in this body?'' \n \n `` Yes sire, but keep in mind that humans are in the seventy-third percentile for mortality, while skraaken are in the ninety-ninth.'' \n \n Kall shrugged. `` I guess you're right, I just got spoiled by skraaken longevity.'' He stared at himself in the mirror for a moment. `` How long did my father live?'' \n \n `` Nine hundred and seventy-two years, he experienced 14 transfers.'' \n \n `` What about my grandfather?'' \n \n `` Eight hundred and thirty six years, he experienced 13 transfers.'' \n \n `` And what about me?'' Kall asked, with just the beginning of a smile. \n \n `` So far you have lived one thousand four hundred and ninety-two years and have experienced 19 transfers.'' \n \n `` Not bad huh.'' Kall said as he turned around. `` And after my last transfer you said I had what, 3 or 4 more left in me.'' \n \n Jarkin was quiet for a moment. `` Sire, while you are correct about my previous estimate, during this latest transfer there were some... complications.'' \n \n The grin slid from Kall's face, being replaced by a grim mask. `` What do you mean by, complications?'' \n \n `` Well sire,'' Jarkin began. `` as you know your previous life was exceptionally long, even by Skraaken standards, this caused your consciousness to... stagnate.'' \n \n `` Stagnate?'' \n \n `` Yes sire. This made it a much more laborious process to remove it and complete it. On top of that most of your previous transfers were between species that were very similar and shared numerous attributes, this made the transition smoother and easier on your consciousness. However, humans and skraaken have virtually no similarities making the transition much rougher, as seen in your difficulty getting out of bed.'' \n \n Kall nodded somberly. `` So you're saying, this is my last life.'' \n \n `` Yes sire.'' Jarkin agreed. `` If we were to attempt another transfer, I estimate a 75 % chance of a transfer tear occurring. The outcome of whi-'' \n \n `` Best case I'm insane, worst case I'm a vegetable.'' Kall interrupted him. \n \n `` Unfortunately, you are correct sire.'' \n \n Kall turned back to the mirror. `` So what do we do now?'' \n \n `` Our priority should be to appoint an Empress and establish an heir.'' Jarkin started to leave. `` I will contact the earth embassy and have them send over suitable candidates.'' \n \n `` No.'' \n \n Jarkin halted mid-air and rotated back. `` What, sire?'' \n \n Kall turned to him. `` If I'm going to marry and start a family, I want it to be with the right person. Not just an appropriate candidate, but someone I care for, someone I love.'' \n \n `` Sire,'' Jarkin started. `` I understand your desire, but it is simply impractical.'' \n \n `` Has my new appearance been made public?'' Kall asked, ignoring Jarkin's previous statement. \n \n `` Not yet sire.'' Jarkin stated having served The Emperor long enough to know that the argument had already been lost. \n \n `` Good.'' Kall said with a smile. `` Then let's go to earth.'' \n \n Kall strided across the room to the door. \n \n `` Sire!'' \n \n `` What?'' Kall sighed. \n \n `` Humans tend to wear clothes.'' \n \n Kall looked down at his naked form and then back up, attempting to maintain a regal disposition. `` Very well, bring me something to wear.'' \n \n `` Of course, Sire.''

He had been travelling with the hairy giant for almost a year, and though Han Solo could usually understand Shyriiwook, sometimes the subtleties of the language eluded him. \n \n `` Chewbacca. Chewie,'' Han said, flicking the auto-pilot switch and turning to the Wookiee, `` I like you. You know I like you. You're a great co-pilot, a crafty smuggler, and you've shown me that Trandoshans' arms and legs come right off if you pull hard enough.'' Han and Chewbacca laughed, remembering the incident fondly. \n \n `` But if this life-debt thing is gon na work out, you got ta speak a little slower.'' The Wookiee ran his clawed fingers through the thick fur covering his belly; a nervous habit Solo had noticed him doing whenever his barking language was misunderstood by a non-native speaker. \n \n `` RRR-WAHH.

I've already told you, Chewie, Wookiee idioms do n't translate into Basic.'' \n \n `` Muawa.''

Solo turned to look at the viewscreen and tried to understand what the Wookiee's problem was. \n \n `` Oh,'Do I see a ship behind us'!'' he said as the Wookiee kept tapping the little dot moving across the screen, `` Yeah, I do. Looks like it's just a bulk transport, a little one. Probably not a problem but... I've got a bad feeling about this. Check to see if it's in range to get a visual on us.'' \n \n `` Ohh haa... Uma.

Just maintain the cruising speed, I'll run to the back and see if I can get a better look at them from there.'' \n \n As Han Solo ran through the corridors of his ship, Captain Malcolm Reynolds ran through the cramped hallways of his own ship, the Serenity. His pilot had just reported a visual on the ship they were hired to pursue, and Mal wanted to check and double-check that what the pilot had seen was the Millennium Falcon. He had n't met Vader, but the stories he'd heard about his new employer made Mal uncomfortable. He did n't trust the Empire, and he did n't trust the greasy military liaison who had contacted them and asked them to chase down the smuggler. Mal did like money, though, and the Empire was offering a lot of it. \n \n ***Okay, I have to study, if you guys like this, let me know and I'll update it tomorrow.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] An exorcism of a young girl , in the perspective of the demon .\n","story":"It was early in the morning when we first met, it was still dark out. I saw her walking along the fields in the twilight rain, she was wearing her night gown, corn flower blue. At first she could n't see me but then I followed her home. I hid under her bed while she crept under the covers. She was just a little thing, could n't have been more than 10 years old. The young ones are always the best, so much potential and yet gentle and unassuming; receptive to the forces around them, like a ball of clay. I waited until she fell asleep before I made my move. \n \n I stood watching over her for a while. The house was utterly silent as I prepared to enter her body. When I first entered her mind it was like planting a seed. At first I had no control over her, she barely even acknowledged my presence within her but like any seed my roots were fertilized by her youthful subconscious. As the nightmares became more vivid and the screams became louder I slowly but surely tightened my control on her. The key is to deprive them of sleep, the conscious mind needs it to replenish itself. Once the conscious mind is weakened it begins to shut down and the human defaults to its more primitive tendencies, that is when I can control her, like the strings of a marionette. \n \n Her parents did n't seem to understand what was going on. Every night around 3:00 am we would play together, running around the house, slamming doors. The odd time we would even head to the chicken coop, she lived on a farm, and cut the heads off of chickens. It always amused me seeing them run around for those brief milliseconds like the so apt expression claims. The worst of times were always on a Sunday, her wretched family would drag us to church. It was always so hard to suppress my disgust, one day while the reverend gave a sermon, I jumped up on the pew and cursed the man, `` Fuck you Reverend Holstein, eat my c**t! ``, I lifted the skirt of her small summer dress. \n It was about that time that her parents started to get wise to me. I knew what was coming, my presence had made quite the impression on my sweet little hostess. No longer were her eyes bright and loving, her hair was now brittle and wiry, her soft skin now bore large festering sores and her fingernails were all chewed away. \n It was a rainy day when he arrived, I smelt him coming from a mile away. Another one of his holy emissaries, draped in the holy cloth of their saviour. `` Fuck you Holstein, she belongs to me!'' With a chanting of his holy scripture I felt nails screeching along a chalkboard. `` Arrrgggghhh!!'' \n `` Identify yourself demon!'' `` Fuck you Holstein, I'll fuck your mother tonight!!'' \n \n I gazed upon the terrified faces of her mother and father. To hear such words escape the mouth of an innocent child; I sensed a part of them died that day. I was still in control of my little puppet and I refused to give her back. She belonged to me now. I had to destroy what they thought was still their little angel, make them believe that she was gone. Only then could I continue to manifest myself through her. `` I fucking hate you Clarise and David, you are shitty fucking parents! Look what you made me do!!'' I ripped out a patch of her hair and banged my head against the wall while cursing them all. \n The priest continued chanting, I felt myself restrained by some force and then he brandished that fucking crucifix! `` Arrgghh!!'' `` Have at the demon! You shall identify yourself to me at once!'' The holy water was scalding, corroding my grasp over her. I needed to distract them, those six pairs of eyes on me ripping the girl from my grasp, in an instant we were standing side by side in the same room and I could see that sweet little girl walking towards her parents, away from me. `` Raarrgghh, I AM ZOZO!!'' \n \n `` The power of Christ compels you!

Surviving in this melancholy state of a town had taken its toll on me the past few days. I had my phone, but what was the point? The cell towers would be down, there would be no calls, no internet, no messages. \n \n I walked through what seemed to me a city of glass. My reflection cast off in every direction, but was distorted by the various angles of it. In one direction, I looked like a woman clutching her purse. In the other, a skater attempting to learn a new trick. Ahead of me, a bus waiting to pick up several people. Reflections are an amazing thing, are n't they? \n \n I moved through the streets, being careful to run into any panes of glass. The reflections stared at me. Some smiled, others turned away, while a select few stared in silence. Ah, I guess the isolation is doing a number on me now. I'm now giving the reflections personalities. This will have to come up in the meeting. \n \n I reached the corner and entered the door. It's a small office, with reflections resembling patients and workers. I knew better than last time, and just strolled right in the office in the back. The reflections I made glared at me, and the one resembling woman at the desk called out to me, `` He's ready to see you John!'' I held my head, I had to stop hearing things. \n \n I reached his door which had the words *Clark Redman PsyD. *, painted on it in elaborate cursive. I did n't bother knocking, and opened the door calmly. I saw the reflection of me that resembled Dr. Redman. \n \n `` Hello, doc,'' I said drearily. \n \n He looked at me, `` Well, hello John.'' He paused for a minute to collect some papers from his desk. He was a stout older man with glasses permanently ingrained over his eyes. `` Have we had any progress?'' \n \n I laughed, `` You mean, have you had any progress, doctor?'' \n \n Dr. Redman looked at me thoughtfully. `` Well yes I have,'' he paused for a moment, `` I've learned a lot about what I call the *Survivor Complex*'' \n \n `` Surivior Complex?'' My imaginary conversations with this shrink never ceased to amaze me. Where in my subconscious did I devise that name? \n \n `` Yes, the concept where one believes he is the sole survivor of a group of people, in your case the human race, and ca n't be made to see otherwise.'' \n \n I laughed again. I spoke, `` I do enjoy chats with my subconscious, doc, but this is bit absurd. You're suggesting that I am incorrectly believing that I am only survivor of the human race?'' \n \n `` Well, John, if you-'' \n \n I stood up, suddenly feeling sick. I could n't have these thoughts, living alone is going to be hard enough. I should have never let a reflection develop a voice in the first place. I had put my trust in my imagination, and that would be my downfall. \n \n `` Good day, Doctor Redman. I should say this will be my last appointment.'' \n \n As I left, I heard Redman mutter something, it was in the context of `` hoplessly lost'' and `` phoning the police''.\n"}

Dr. Butler, the headmaster, said the perfect wholeness and symmetry of the numbers was a sure sign that this was a gift from God, and as such I was to use it to warn all good Christians of His enemies. \n \n `` Most of the boys are a three or four,'' I told him. I glanced at the headmaster's ledger.

The headmaster was half standing over the ledger, reaching for more paper and his seals. Presumably all the teachers and staff would be warned about this boy. I leaned over the desk and looked down the ledger, trying to find the name. \n \n `` This one,'' I said, pointing, `` down at the bottom of the first page.'' The headmaster seemed surprised. \n \n `` Are you absolutely sure?'' he asked, `` Why, his brother has been with us for four years already, and he is no more than a three.'' \n \n `` He is a ten,'' I said, confirming. Dr. Butler began moving about his desk again, mumbling to himself about how he must warn everybody, and that any bad behavior from this boy would be entirely unacceptable.

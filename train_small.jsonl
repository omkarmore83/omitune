Rumor had it that Earth 23 had a cock shaped America, the first thing I did after porting and hailing a taxi was look at the tourist guide map, sure enough it did indeed look like a giant cock because a stream of archipelagos craned out to the Middle East making it look like America was busting a fat nut on the opposite continent. \n \n `` So is this normal business for you?'' I asked the man in the well dressed suit escorting me to the interdimension federation court house. \n \n `` Yis, your counterpart is to be sentenced for his crime in the next three hours, twelve versions of you have been summoned from the federation of dimensions to testify on his behalf.'' the man said plainly turning his attention back to his phone. \n \n `` Nice to meet you, the name is...'' I began extending my hand. \n \n `` Jeff. Yis, I know.'' He interrupted looking at my hand with slight disgust. \n \n `` What!? Did I really do something so bad that you ca n't shake an alternate version of myself's hand?'' I asked aggressively without thinking. \n \n The man just looked at me blankly, like I had offended him. \n \n `` I heard stories about Earth 11 apparently, it is customary to touch one another when greeting for the first time. What the fuck is wrong with you people?'' He asked harshly. \n \n `` Oh. I thought you had something against me because what my alt did, my bad, yeah where I am from we do shake hands when greeting some people even kiss and hug.'' I told the man plainly. \n \n `` Ugh. Your rituals are...'' the man just rolled his eyes trailing off back to his phone. \n \n An awkward silence set in so I stared out the window a bit, it was the familiar New York Skyline with a few variations I was new to but the same in regards to architecture. The taxis were basically the same too. \n \n `` So that's a strange accent you have it sounds New Zealand.'' I commented nervously. \n \n `` I do n't know what a Noo Zeel und is, but I got my accent from Jamaica.'' the suit said clearly looking as if he wanted this to be over as soon as possible. \n \n `` So is it true that you guys have monarchies still? That might have been Earth 18 but I swear reading an article where you guys still have royalty... I mean we do too but their popularity is almost null.'' I said not being able to help myself from him not wanting me to talk. \n \n `` Yis, that's correct we have eleven moarchies within our continents borders. The crime for which your alternate is accused took place in the largest, it will be getting multi dimensional coverage. Her we take the Kings of the Amerikas very seriously.'' the man seemed pleased at saying this. \n \n `` Oh so did, so did I like kill someone... or well the other me kill someone important?'' I wanted to wait before asking but the suspense was killing me. \n \n `` No.'' the man said turning to look me up and down again like I was dangerous and disgusting. \n \n `` Well what the fuck did I do man? What could possibly be so bad that an interdimensional jury of mes have to stand trial as peers?'' I asked eagerly. \n \n `` You. You created a chimera, which is a serious offense here.'' the suit said putting his phone in his jacket as the taxi pulled up the steps of a municipal building and began getting out. \n \n `` A chimera? You mean like two animals fused together? Am I a geneticist here? Did I create some kind of fucked up monstrosity?'' I was excited at the concept of being a renegade scientist who teetered on the fringes. \n \n `` Not exactly... you went on a drunken binder and found your way into the sovereign sanctuary and created a sheople.'' this time the man stood looking empathetic at me. \n \n `` I still do n't understand, Sir.'' I pleaded hoping he would stop beating around the bush. \n \n The man palmed his face, which is never a good sign. \n \n `` Jeff, your alternate got drunk and wandered into an animal pen and fucked the King's royal goat, resulting in a goat child.'' He told me as the shame set in. \n \n My god, I thought, I can not do this, inter dimensional press coverage, goat babies, penis shaped countries. I threw my hands up in refusal. \n \n `` Nope. Nope. NOPE. Uh uh.'' I said storming off in the opposite direction trying to think of how I could get away from this permanently.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ EU ] Before Bruce Wayne 's death , he created an artificial intelligence in a robotic Bat-Suit to protect Gotham in his absence . Eighty years later , the AI has turned against Gotham . A team of gifted teenagers take on the robot while branding the costumes and themes of Batman 's former enemies .\n","story":"It started when I was 8. I had been staying over at my Aunt and Uncle's house, enjoying myself, while my parents were having a date night. Marijuana had just been legalized in Gotham. \n \n The bastard bat-thing, which our law enforcement had been as incapable of stopping as the original, used an old comprehension engine called `` Watson'' in order to parse and understand the laws it was supposed to be keeping in place. The engine was slow, and prone to bugs. It just so happened that it had yet to keep up with the new law on marijuana. \n \n When the bat thing had started out, it had been explicitly programmed not to kill. No breaking bones, no crushing skulls, no piercing chests - just wrap up the criminals and leave them hanging for the police. This had worked for years, but the problem was, it was also programmed to try to minimize recidivism rates - that is, try to make sure that people it caught the first time did not commit crimes again. This became a problem when, one time, it caught a repeat criminal for the umpteenth time, and, due to awkward positioning, accidentally happened to hang him by his throat instead of his legs. The bot was unaware it had killed him, but it noticed over the coming months that he no longer showed up committing crimes. So, it repeated throwing its batarangs at that same awkward angle, and began hanging people by their throats. Recidivism rates had never been better. \n \n So, the day after my parent's date night, I was riding passenger seat in my Aunt's car and staring down at my game boy. As we pulled up to my house, my Aunt turned off the car, then uttered a strangled gasp. I looked up at my house, but before I could see anything, my aunt grabbed my face and hugged it to her chest, shouting `` no, don't-!'' The pain and fear in her voice terrified me. She had to loosen her grip on me for just a moment to start the car, and I took the chance to wrestle out of her grip and look at my front porch. My parents hung there, swaying gently in the breeze. \n \n From that night on, I became obsessed with the bat-thing, and as I learned more, with artificial intelligence. I needed to *know* what the bat-thing was doing, needed to get inside its head. My family had been wealthy, and so as it became apparent that I was doing far better in school than my peers, skipping grades consistently, the money my parents left me was used to hire tutors to get me even further along more quickly. The constant learning was a numbing agent; while I was learning, I did n't have to be thinking about what had happened. \n \n In the mean time, my Uncle and Aunt found other children who had had similar experiences. At first, I had been loath to talk to them - I could just be learning more, understanding more, I did n't want to sit around in a puddle of sobbing kids and feel miserable about myself. But, my Uncle and Aunt pointed out that these kids were displaying similar habits to myself, quickly climbing through school, with a laser focus on artificial intelligence. My Aunt and Uncle decided to bring the kids into my tutor sessions, and we became a class of our own, three kids hell-bent on understanding the monster that hung petty criminals in our streets. \n \n In the mean time, the police department could do nothing. The old bat bastard, worried that any key given to the police that would turn off the bat-thing could be figured out by criminals - or a corrupt police department - had given them the same options as the criminals: either destroy it, or do n't make it angry. They had, at one point, lured the bat-thing into a warehouse on the docs, and imploded the warehouse on top of it; but it survived, and repaired itself back at the old bastard's mansion, which was so booby-trapped no one could go near it, including the police, for the same paranoid reasons as why they could n't turn it off. An EMP had also been tried, hoping to fry the electrical component of the bat-thing, but the important logic in it had been protected by layers of armor and a Faraday cage, making it near-impossible to fry. \n \n Now, I am 19, and a graduate student in computer science. My tiny class has excelled to the same heights, and we discovered something we think can kill it. By using the only link the bastard's compound had to the outside world - the Watson computer's connection to the law database - we found a bug that allowed us to send it a broken law file and make it execute the file as code. The old bastard Wayne had been smart, and made sure Watson was cordoned off from the bat-thing, so we could n't turn it off from there. But, we did get access to something incredibly powerful - the training simulations the old bastard had used, over and over again, to teach the bat-thing how to fight crime. \n \n During our studies in artificial intelligence, we had learned about a concept called `` over-training.'' Basically, with certain learning programs, if you give it an input - say, a picture - and tell it what to do when it sees that input a couple of times, it'll pick up general details of that picture, such as the overall color, some shapes, etc., and then perform its action whenever it sees a similar picture that matches those patterns it learned. This is good for, say, when you're trying to train a computer program to recognize a train platform in pictures, so that an automated train can stop whenever it sees a platform. \n \n The problem is, if you show the program the *same exact picture* too many times, it picks up on unimportant details too, and starts relying on them. So, a crack in the wall in your training picture could become something that triggers the `` stop'' action on the train, making it stop randomly throughout the tunnels; or, the type of clocks used on platforms get switched out, and the train happened to be using them as the way to recognize platforms, meaning it *doesn't* stop, and rams into the back of the train ahead of it. \n \n ( continued in response comment )\n"}

{"prompt":"Writing Prompt : Write from an antagonist 's point of view\n","story":"I sit here in my leather desk chair, staring out my enormous window from my pitch black office. I can see the entire city from this spot. I can see the fires rising from the chaos that I have created. Lightning streaks across the sky, illuminating shadows of people ravaging the streets below, believing they are all gods. Wait until they find out that they must listen to every command that I issue. For now, I will let them battle it out down there. I could care less if the weak survive, anyways. Regardless of who survives, everyone has gone mad, and it is all thanks to me. Finally, I have brought hell to Earth, and soon Lucifer will be here to take me by his side, for the atrocities that I have committed, and with my true father, I will rule the world with an iron fist. \n \n Neither The Crimson Crusader nor the local police had knowledge that just twelve hours ago my henchmen, dressed as delivery drivers for a new local gas company, began to pump every station's supply throughout the city with a vapor that I had created in my lab downstairs. Within hours, over a quarter of the cars in the city were filled with it, and we needed only to wait for those people to make their drives back home. Soon, everyone in the city would be afflicted by it's powerful toxins, and that time has now come. Also, anyone that had left town with a gas tank full of our vapor would bring the same chaos to Hazelton's nearest neighbors. I would check the news to see what's happening in the cities around us, but it appears as though there is n't a working power source within ten miles of here. \n \n There is movement behind me. Now I've got a shit-eating grin pasted onto my face. I turn around to meet my father, to have him take me home. I can hardly see anything in my office, but suddenly another flash of lightning lights up my surroundings, for less than a second. There is something on the floor, and I walk over slowly to get a better look at it. \n \n It is a sign of some kind; three vertical lines, and one horizontal. I realize that there is pitchfork in front of me, burned into the carpet. \n \n `` You have come for me father! I am unworthy of your love, but will accept it. I will take myself under your wing, and together we shall - `` Suddenly, I take a shot to the face. \n \n I open my eyes after I hit my head on the ground, hard. It felt like a bag of bricks had just hit my face. I could smell blood coming from my nose. A sacrifice for my father. I begin to look up, but after hearing a voice, I lower my head again in a bow, to show respect. \n \n `` Damien Chulthon... To believe that anyone could love you after the crimes that you have committed is obnoxiously obsurd. And now you will pay for those crimes.'' \n \n `` But father, can I not come to be by your side, and together, we can reign over these lands?'' \n \n `` I am not your father, I'm your worst fucking nightmare.'' \n \n I am startled, and I look up. There, in front of me, is The Crimson Crusader's ugly mask, staring back at me, and I hardly am able to blink before he lands another blow to my face. His boots were extremely hard, steel-toed, that's for sure. My jaw is now numb, and I'm angry at myself for not realizing sooner the mistake I had made. But, how did The Crimson Crusader escape from the grasp of the vapors? \n \n `` How did you escape from the grasp of my vapors?'' \n \n `` As soon as I had heard the first reports today of people running around screaming that the apocalypse was upon us, and the only way to survive was to stay out of their way, I knew that the most evil and brilliant scientist in the city must have been to blame.'' He exclaimed. \n \n That smile comes across my face again. \n \n `` Unfortunately, I spent the entire day searching for Natasha Locke, only to find out that she is out of town on vacation. Either way, I knew something was up, and my mask successfully prevented any of your vapors from entering into my system.'' \n \n Suddenly, my smile dissipates. Now, I'm really angry. I throw a fist, and The Crimson Crusader grabs it... I never was much of a fighter. I take another hit to the chest, this one slamming me against the nearest wall. \n \n `` Please, stop! There is a cure! It is downstairs in my laboratory! My access card is on my desk!'' \n \n `` That does n't matter now. I will get that cure out, but I've got something to finish right here, right now.'' \n \n Another blow with those rock-like boots, this one square between my legs. I fall to the ground, and lay there crying. \n \n `` You really fucked up this time.'' The Crimson Crusader said, `` and there will be no more second chances for you.'' \n \n He grabs me by my jacket, and lifts me up. I scream out for mercy, but no one hears. He throws me into the window, and it cracks. One more time he grabs me, and I beg him to stop. \n \n `` Better luck in hell Damien.'' He said, before launching me one more time into the window. This time it broke, and I flew out, with nothing to break my fall but the street below.\n"}

He flashes that'too' white smile at me. He looks over my file again, sitting in his little black stool, `` Here for a booster?'' \n \n I nod and roll up my sleeve as he fumbles around his cabinets, pulling out a small pre-filled and sealed syringe. \n \n `` Okay, you know the drill,'' he says holding the syringe. With a quick swipe across my wrist, a digital user interface appears before my eyes. My personal data scrolls by on virtual displays as I look at the doctor and register a duel. I give a small chuckle. Back in the olden days a duel was a fight to the death, now it was the only means of disabling the world wide PVP system between two people. If we did n't the second that needle touched my skin, it'd bend like a reed. \n \n The word'Accepted' flashes in my vision as the Doctor accepts the duel, `` Alrighty then.'' \n \n Jennings step over with the syringe and a individual alcohol swab, but somethings wrong. He's sweating in this cold office. His lip twitches. His left hand is behind his back. Oh God! \n \n With a quick motion, I kick the doctor in the chest and he stumbled back into the cabinets. From behind his back his hand swings out revealing an revolver. He points it at me as I roll off the examining table. A loud bang rips though the room. I look up and see the doctor reeling from the blast. He's not used to the recoil of the weapon and was n't expecting the loud bang in such a small room. \n \n On my feet again, I rush the good doctor. He raises the gun at me, but he struggles with it a bit, giving me enough time to close the gap. With a thud, my fist finds his gut and knocks the wind out of him. His arm goes wide and another round rips through the office. Ears ringing, I reach for his hand and rip the gun from his grip. Jennings crumples down onto the floor. \n \n Outside I can hear women screaming and people yelling, no doubt one of the nurses will be calling the police. I turn my attention back to the doctor curled up in front of me. Raising the gun to his face, `` Who paid you to kill me?'' \n \n Jennings mutterers something incoherent, I smash the grip of the revolver into those too-white teeth, `` Give me a name!'' He sputters saliva, blood and bits of teeth, `` I surren...'' \n \n Before he can finish I point the barrel at his head and pull the trigger painting the wall with his brains. Could n't let him surrender and reactivate the PVP system. Yeah I wo n't get anymore answers from him, but I could n't let him get away. I rummage through his pockets looking for any clues to who hired him. As I go through his pockets, a virtual display pops up showing the doctors contact information from my digital Rolodex. A red stamp appears over his contact information, `` Disconnected.'' I blink and close the display, no need to be reminded. Everyone who had the good Doc in their contacts would be notified. \n \n Removing his wallet, I go though business cards and photos. With a blink, they're added to my digital gallery. I swipe his debit cards and credit cards across my wrist, giving them a scan. I'm sure the doctor has a bank account who's balance will go to his next of kin, but anything on his person is fair game. \n \n I can hear cops outside. I open the office door and yell for them. In a second, the room is swarming with heavily armed police and swat.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Taxes become optional , however , those who do n't pay are not protected under the law .\n","story":"`` Every bloody year, it's the same crap. Every year!'' I thew my pen across the table. An effective demonstration of my frustration, clearly. \n \n Ever since that amendment to the constitution narrowly passed it's been the same thing every year: someone comes around, asks if you want to pay taxes or not, and then either collects the sum or leaves your home empty handed. \n \n Honestly, it's extortion either way. You either pay the government a flat rate of 49 % of your income, or you wind up paying roughly the same amount for the various `` Civil Protection Services'' and `` Neighbourhood Alliance'' groups. \n \n Some would argue it's the price of safety, but I disagree. I remember when you could walk down the street without having to have your TP badge - a badge you wear around your neck denoting that you are `` tax-protected'' - to every onlooker and police officer that passed by. \n \n And the police! Do n't get me started on that. Watching them stand around and do nothing while someone gets mugged, or beaten, or raped. It's as if the humanity has been stripped from us and we're left with a badge to remind us of our worth... or lack of. \n \n The taxation agent looked at me from across the table. Having retrieved my pen, she seemed unimpressed with my reaction or my lack of response to her question. \n \n `` Right,'' she began dismissively, `` what's it going to be this year? Taxes, yea?'' \n \n I thumbed my badge with my left hand, feeling its slight but noticeable weight shift. This badge polarizes people. A system that was already class-conscious and divided became even more so when these bloody things were introduced. \n \n So, what was it going to be? \n \n Would I sign a writ of acknowledgement of taxation debt, pay my taxes now, and live another year under the protections afforded to me by the government? \n \n Or, would I finally grow a backbone and tell her to piss off? \n \n I guess the answer would depend entirely on whether or not I was prepared to change my status quo. \n \n `` Give me the paper.'' I demanded, clearly showing my continued aggravation. \n \n The agent did as she was asked, sliding over a document with no less than six carbon copies. `` Sign here, and sign here to acknowledge the direct debit from your bank account, and please date the day, within three business days, that we can withdraw the money.'' \n \n That's when it clicked. A realization. Maybe this is the moment I would finally grow a spine and tell the government to pound sand. Maybe this would be the day that I stood on my own two feet, without the governments `` protection'' and `` laws''. \n \n She looked at me impatiently. I was wasting her time. \n \n I looked her in the eye, confidently. Knots formed in my stomach, and I could tell that my anxiety was building. `` You know what I'm going to do, Ms. Agent?'' \n \n She tilted her head to the side, her eyes narrowing. Her right arm moved slightly, though I was n't able to see what her hand was doing since the table was obstructing my view. I could only assume she was reaching for her sidearm. \n \n I signed the paper twice, dated it for tomorrow. She reached across the table and snapped them up, left my copies, and left without saying another word. \n \n I wish I was n't so spineless. I wish even more that I did n't have the same bloody struggle every time she showed up. \n \n But, even more than that, I wish I had noticed she did n't even bring her sidearm this year. \n \n *sigh*. \n \n EDIT: Feedback and constructive criticism appreciated: )\n"}

The `` Elevation Committee '' is now hearing bids on who and how to `` elevate '' the humans of Earth .\n","story":"`` The final prospect in need of a Guiding Species today,'' the Chairman of the Elevation Committee took a deep breath before continuing, `` is Humanity.'' Chaos ensued. \n \n \n `` Are you *kidding* me?!'' \n \n \n `` They do not deserve the opportunity!'' \n \n \n `` Humans would usher in a new dark age for the galaxy!'' \n \n \n Civility had been completely thrown to the wayside. The Chairman knew this would be the reaction from the representative species, but rules were rules and every sentient species of the required technological advancement were to be given the chance. Still, he had saved Humanity as the final prospect for the day on purpose. \n \n \n `` Please, please calm down. I understand all of your objections, I may even agree with most of them, but you are all familiar with how we operate.'' The angered voices quickly went quiet to hear the Chairman's voice of reason. `` If no Guiding Species steps forward to lead a new prospect, they will be left to themselves. Isolated from the galaxy under punishment of law. They could go extinct before they ever become a Type II civilization.'' \n \n \n Other than a few scattered whispers and shuffling chairs, the hall was silent. Not a single species was willing to guide Humanity into their next golden age. \n \n \n `` Well, then. A vote is required before the decision is made final. If there is any representative species who would like to challenge the decision, your chance to step forward to guide the prospect species is now.'' The Chairman reached for his gavel. Not a sound in the room; the species was doomed. `` By order of the Elevation Committee,'' he raised his gavel into the air, `` contact with Humanity is forbiden and they shall be isola-'' \n \n \n `` We will guide them.'' A bipedal being stood from his chair, pulling back the hood of his robes to show his face. `` It is time for the Centauri to guide a new prospect, we have waited long enough.'' All of the many eyes from the many different beings in the hall were glued to the robed Centauri monk. \n \n \n `` You are willing to volunteer your people as the Guiding Species for Humanity? You are aware of their... violent nature, yes?'' The Chairman continued to hold his gavel in the air. \n \n \n `` We are. The Centauri have waited a very long time for the right prospect for us to guide.'' The monk walked towards the council's seats in the front of the hall. `` The Humans are violent. They hurt and kill one another seemingly without end. They destroy their world and the non-sentient beings that inhabit it with them. They are corrupt. They also have potential for greatness - just like all of our species did - and my people have a gift suited, I think, just for them.'' \n \n \n `` Ah, I think I understand,'' the Chairman smiled. `` Your empathy.'' \n \n \n `` Yes. The Centauri are born with complete and absolute empathy. We can not harm another being without feeling it's pain. Even being near another creature allows us to feel as it feels. We can pass this gift on to Humanity, for better or for worse. The Humans will ascend or they will be consumed by the suffering they cause.'' \n \n \n And the gavel crashed downwards.\n"}

He had n't seen that look in... Was it really years? His heart was hammering in his chest and he could only stare at her. The look of gladness in her eyes melted into concern. And she moved forward, pressing a cool hand to his forehead, \n \n `` Cal, are you okay?'' she asked. `` You look... Are you sick? You look awful.'' \n \n He struggled to speak and to focus on her face, but his vision was blurred. \n \n `` Ginny, I - No, I'm fine. I'll see you in a bit,'' he managed. \n \n `` Back to the basement?'' she asked. And then he saw it, the seedling of the look he had come to recognize and resent in her eyes. But it was so new, without the bitter edge it took on after months and he saw it clearly - it was sadness. She missed him. He swallowed against the lump in his throat. \n \n Calvin closed the distance between them in just three steps. He slid his hands in her hair and cupped the back of her head, pressing his forehead against hers and staring into her eyes - so dark brown. The smell of her hair - that vanilla stuff she used. How long had it been? \n \n `` I will be right back,'' he whispered. `` And then we can go out to Poorman's for lunch.'' \n \n That faint look of disappointment that had manifested in her gaze was replaced with a warm smile. He kissed the corner of her mouth, and felt tears skip loose when he closed his eyes. This was n't what he expected. \n \n When he stepped back from the embrace he felt empty. He descended the basement stairs quickly and saw himself there. A sense of wrongness and dislocation crawled over his skin, but he ignored it and grabbed himself and spun him around. It was like looking into a kindhearted mirror - fewer lines, less red shot through the whites of his eyes, less frost in the hair. \n \n `` Recognize me, Cal?'' he said, his voice a rusty growl. \n \n `` It works,'' he whispered. His eyes took on a fevered look of excitement. `` I knew it!'' \n \n `` Shut up, jackass,'' said Calvin. `` You're going upstairs now. You're going to shower. You are going to take Ginny to Poorman's and talk to her. And hold her hand. And -'' \n \n `` Are you insane? You just told - no *proved* to me it works. I ca n't stop now,'' said Cal. \n \n Calvin sighed. He could feel the memories forming in his brain. He could see himself bludgeoning himself to death. He could see binding him and trying to pursue Ginny himself. Different outcomes seemed to unfurl in front of his eyes. But each one was surrounded by strange crackling images - like the broken-spectrum aura he would get before a migraine. He knew it would n't work because he needed both of himselves to even be here. Goddamn timetravel. What a fucking waste. \n \n `` I'll do it,'' he said. `` You go, and I'll make sure it happens.'' \n \n He saw the doubt flicker across his own, younger face. \n \n `` You know I will. But please... We ca n't lose her. She does n't understand.'' \n \n Uncertainty flickered across Cal's face. \n \n `` But Ginny's fine,'' he said. \n \n `` She is. She is now. But we do n't know when to stop, do we?'' \n \n `` You coming, Cal?'' her voice caused Calvin to close his eyes and he struggled and did n't quite succeed in stifling a sob. \n \n `` Jesus, is she dead?'' Cal's voice was a horrified whisper. \n \n `` No... She just. Could n't compete. And she knew it,'' said Calvin. `` Please go. Please.'' \n \n `` I'm coming, Gin.'' \n \n Calvin watched himself ascend the stairs. Then he got back to work. \n \n\n"}

One day , a little boy discovers a twinkie in a buried cabinet ...\n","story":"He looked left. He looked right. His brother was nowhere to be seen. \n \n He ate the yellow sponge quickly, savoring it less than inhaling it. Still gross, but at least it had texture. And that was it- the last one of the three he'd found. Reflecting on the texture, he was n't sure if he'd want a fourth- he was well and truly done with these things. \n \n He put the wrapper in his pocket, carefully folded so the little white dots and yellow spongecake faced inward- he knew that he needed to preserve the remnant contraband as well as possible. \n \n Leaving the abandoned building, his brother joined him, hands black from his own unsuccessful foraging upstairs. \n \n The sun was setting, and they determined to walk home. Father would soon return from his route, and they wanted to be there when he arrived- better to help him unload his day's bounty, and avoid his not inconsiderable ire, as well. \n \n As they reached home, father's cart was not yet chained to the steel gate in the field behind, and they both exhaled slightly and entered the front door. With a push and a laugh, his brother claimed the first shower. The boy did n't mind... Water for showers was the one thing they had in abundance. Water for drinking had to be evaporated to remove the salt, of course- the process too inefficient to make farming viable- but showers were one of the few relative luxuries they had left. \n \n Checking the drop box on the way to the shower, his brother noted that their pills had not yet arrived. Not a surprise, considering their scavenging efforts of late had left them a little behind on their payments- the chancellory liked to make their point with little delays like this. Besides, they'd been secreting away 1\/4 of a pill at each meal for the last week, just in case. \n \n The boy felt his pocket, verifying the wrapper was still there. A couple of times on the walk home he thought he'd heard it crinkling, but his brother had n't seemed to notice; when he'd pushed him in his dash for the shower, he was sure it had made noise, but his bother was down the hall in a flash, concerned with washing away the day's crust, and now he was alone. \n \n He walked into his fathers room. He stepped between the dresser and mattress, over to the wooden crate jammed between the bed and the far wall. He looked out the window at the field. Still nothing. \n \n The crate was locked. His father had the only key. He pulled the wrapper from his pocket, carefully unfolding it, ensuring that not a crumb hit the floor. He pulled up the lid of the crate just enough to carefully slide the wrapper into the void, closed it slowly, and retraced his steps out of the room. \n \n He heard his brother calling him to take his turn in the shower. The boy did n't respond, instead walking through the main room, out the front door, and down to the ComScreen on the corner. \n \n The call was surprisingly perfunctory; he'd imagined they'd have more questions, but he guessed they got this kind of call often, and it was n't that big a deal for them in the grand scheme of things. They thanked him for his good citizenship, and the screen went dark, a single horizontal blip of light flashing as the call ended. \n \n Turning back, he watched his father parking the cart. The load was obviously light. A sigh left the boy's lips as he dug in his pocket for his last flavor tablet. Cherry, his favorite. At least it got rid of that disgusting sponge flavor. \n \n His father entered the house, slamming the door behind him. No doubt he'd be pissed that their pills had n't been delivered yet, but he knew it was his fault, and that was just that. Another sigh. Hopefully his father would just go straight to the shower so he did n't have to hear about it. \n \n The boy heard the thump-thump-thump of the airship bearing down on their miserable life, walked in the front door, and waited for the light.\n"}

She always called by the next day, and often returned by the fourth. \n \n *'' Do you know where Odette is? `` * \n \n *'' Of course, Mrs. Pane. She just called me from her room. `` * \n \n They'd believe anything I told them. This was the way things were here, and it always was and always would be. I'd used it against everyone in town except Odette. \n \n Which was why I needed her back here - I needed her to tell me what was real and what was n't. Everyone believed what I told them, to a fault. Until now, my mom still believed I would die if I did n't get enough skittles. Oh, how the things I did haunt me. \n \n Only Odette was real. She was untouched, her mind virgin and innocent reality. I needed to figure out where she was, but how?

Did I just miss her? \n \n Why'd I pick someone as unreliable as Odette as my anchor anyway? I could have picked boring old Suzanne from down the block, or even my cheery younger sister, who lived on the other end of town with Dad. Maybe it was her long limbs and the languorous grace with which she moved. \n \n Maybe. I could have her, if I wanted to. I could make her want me, if I wanted to. But I wanted her to want me of her own accord ever since she spat on my face the day she moved here ten years ago. \n \n I used to dream about us leaving this hellhole town together. Now I had nightmares where we went to the woods and I would fall asleep, only to wake up all alone in the darkness of the night, realizing that Odette was n't there for me anymore and I was stuck in a land of people who would eat their hands if I told them to. \n \n *'' Where's Odette? `` * \n \n *'' Oh Micah, it's okay.

Was Odette fucking with me, hiding from me? I opened my bathroom door quietly, half-expecting her to jump out and crash into me, tumbling onto me in that boyish way of hers, unmindful of how hard she pressed every inch of her body into mine. \n \n Nothing. No one. \n \n The bath tub was full of water. Did I save that, or did Odette? I have n't taken a long bath in a while, instead preferring to shower. Something about a bathtub full of water, something about pools, made me anxious now. Funny, because before Odette disappeared, I was never afraid of them. \n \n The day of her disappearance was blurred from my memory. Was it so uneventful? I usually kept a detailed journal so I could keep track of exactly what I said to who, but I lost my journal too. \n \n Come to think of it, I lost it around the time Odette left. Did she take it? \n \n *'' They found a body, or what is left of one anyway, by the river.

They think it was a teenage girl. `` * \n \n *Odette? `` Have they moved the body yet? `` * \n \n The river was in the woods behind the park. Parents have been lobbying for increased patrol in the area, but there was never enough money in the budget for it. \n \n People had seen Odette sneak into the forest ( or so they tell me - or did I tell them? Fuck. ) I hoped in my heart she was n't... \n \n I found my journal, maroon, lying under a blanket of yellowed leaves and dirt. At least now I would know what I was doing the day she disappeared. It was getting late, so I had to wait until I got home to read it. For now, it would n't hurt to check the river. Odette liked sitting by the river and making vaguely suicidal threats to jump in. We used to stay here all the time. \n \n Maybe she'd ambush me as I approached the river. \n \n *'' Hey Micah, do you think I'd make it if I jumped into this river? That'd be some kinda rush, huh, jumping in here and making it out alive? `` * \n \n My knees felt weak when I heard the river gurgling in the distance.

For an immortal man such as myself, it is very easy to pass as my own son. \n \n My face was clean shaven as opposed to the large barbarous beard I used before, so nobody really paid much attention to me as I walked the fish market, taking in the familiar sights and smells. Something about fortified fishing towns I like, no doubt a remnant of my long forgotten youth where I perhaps grew up near the sea, or spent most of my early life on a boat looking up at a castle. \n \n I walked past an old woman without so much as glancing anywhere near her direction, but she stopped and then after a brief hesitation turned to look at me. ``'Ere... are n't you..?'' \n \n But I was gone, down a side street with an invisible swiftness and grace that could only be developed from a millenia of doing such. It was Mabel. I knew from the moment I saw her on the other end of the street, but hoped she had forgotten me or passed away. \n \n Guess not. I sighed inwardly and leaned against the cool mud wall of the alleyway, wondering whether I should abandon the town altogether now that I had been sighted, or stick to my cover story instead. It was only one person. \n \n Before I could even formulate a decision, a shadow crept slowly and casually towards me. I thought nothing of it at first, but when another did the same from the other end of the alleyway I knew I had sprung a trap. \n \n `` The king is dying John''. The voice came into the light and I saw it was my old friend Enriko. Twenty years had not been kind to his hair, but his smiling eyes remained the same. \n \n When I first knew him, he was nothing more than a squire - an amiable sort of person who did n't mind drinking and laughing along with the local fisherman. I had always sensed a keen intelligence behind his laughter, one that saw people for who they really were and sought ambition and control. I knew he would go far, but hoped that he would n't. \n \n `` John? I'm - I think you are mis-'' I began, but stopped when he drew his saber and his accomplice also. \n \n `` I always knew John. My father told me tales about you when I was a child, how John the Fisherman had rescued him from sea during the Widows storm, and how my grandfather had been similarly saved from a mighty fall when the mountains were first mined.'' \n \n `` My grandfather never knew, but my father certainly did, as I did too in those brief 10 years I knew you - and I just *knew* you'd be back in Hambry sometime in my lifetime.'' \n \n Did I really favor Hambry that much? I groaned internally at how I'd gotten myself into this mess. To be discovered so easily by a grown child. The two of them were advancing on me very slowly almost as if they had been cautioned of what I was capable of. It was time to come clean. \n \n `` Enriko, I beg you - for old time's sake, for all that I've done for your fam-'' \n \n `` The king is dying John'' he said again, `` and you're the only one with the secret that can prolong his life.'' \n \n `` There is no secret!'' I yelled `` I am just as much at mercy to mysteries of the cosmos as you are! If I knew, I would have told you - I would have told everyone!'' \n \n He shook his head and smiled at the floor. `` Come now John, lies will get you nowhere. It is uncharacteristically selfish of you.'' \n \n `` Riko, I can not tell you what I do not myself know'' \n \n `` No matter John, we have ways of extracting sensitive information from defiant individuals. Information which they never claimed to know either.'' \n \n And then I saw it, the hard cold edge in the corners of his eyes, eyes that had done unspeakable acts in the name of ascension and power. \n \n `` What happens to those who are innocent?'' \n \n `` They are discarded, and left to decay in a forgotten dungeon for the rest of their lives. But no one is ever innocent John, no one.'' \n \n For a moment I said nothing, locking the secret I'd discovered all those millenia ago into the far recesses of my mind using a taught mental technique derived from a chance meeting with the Buddha. The method involved isolating a memory as well as the primary external references to that memory within another new memory, compressed in such a way as to make it hard to retrieve, the key being a single insignificant reference that when pulled would unpack the entire structure. \n \n To make the structure more secure, secondary and tertiary references to the memory and the primary references to that memory would also need to be tucked away. \n \n I inhaled visibly and closed my eyes. With a slow smooth exhale the last 3000 years of my life were locked away, accessible by a single lone reference to a boy on his father's ship sailing out away from the foresty outcrop of a small fishing town, looking up at the overlooking castle that was crumbling from the inside out.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] As the Romans begin their push into Gaul , they discover that dragons are real .\n","story":"We marched in columns, for what seemed like years until we finally reached the gates of the great city of Gaul. We had heard rumors about the city and the magic surrounding it but we all brushed it aside as we knew, we were the Roman Empire after all, we have God on our side and Julius Caesar at the helm, nothing can stop us. \n \n Of course there was minimal resistance as we pushed towards the city, many of the commoners had known of the ensuing chaos that was to come. Of the few that stayed, they were worthless to our Empire. Old men, women, and children. There were some particular women that seemed to have some fancy within the troops though. Every man has to get the poison out of their system some way so taking a whore is customary. \n \n One women stood out from the rest though. Instead of the long red hair, milk-white skin and bright blue eyes you'd expect from a Celt, this women had bright green eyes, an olive toned skin, and dark hair. Her thick accent made it hard to understand what she was saying often but all the while she claimed she was from a land far, far away and that magic was still very much alive in her homeland as well as in the great Celtic City. No one believed her, why would they? Some whore trying to talk her way out of a good fucking. \n \n Late one evening this odd woman who called herself Jaina was serving a Centurion, a great honor for someone of her standard, the Centurion was murdered. A small cut to his belly was all it took and she vanished into the night taking her tales of Dragons, enchanted weapons, and sorcery with her. Good riddance. \n \n The time had come for the final march on Gaul. Every soldier was itching for a chance to get his spear wet with the blood of the enemy. We outnumbered them 1000-1. Rumor had it that Julius Caesar himself was spotted among his top ranking Generals discussing strategy. \n \n `` *Milites! Motus*!'' \n \n The roar of thousands upon thousands of soldiers moving as one was almost deafening. But as we approached the gate, all was quiet, there were no archers atop the bannerments defending the gates, there was no hot oil being dropped, pure silence. \n \n `` *Prohibere! *'' \n \n Suddenly, a screech pierced the air. Something so high pitched and deafening that men's ears began to bleed. A smell of sulfur rose into the air. And almost like the Winter Solstice, a large shadow was cast only this time a large beast with wings the size of 4 Calvary standing abreast rose its giant head into the sky and bellowed flame from its mouth and snout. \n \n They're real.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Sitting on a park bench , a homeless man shares his muse for existence with a young writer suffering from a longstanding depression .\n","story":"The night was fairly bright and quite calm. With the pale glow of the moon dominating the stars, and the dimly lit light poles sparsely populating the walking paved paths, the city had no power over the large park at its heart. The trees absorbed the noise and blocked it's light, while still leaving most of the park open to the sky. My favorite bench was dead center of the field, far from all the others and most importantly, the direction it faced allowed now building to peer over the treetops and disturb the serene isolation. I could see even from a distance there was a person sitting, pondering on the bench. They sat on the left side, closest to the light pole with was only a foot or so off to the side. I could see they had their head hung down, and presumed they were reading. I do n't think he heard me walk up, but as I sat down he was a bit startled and hurriedly hid something it the pocket of his long black coat, a heavy sort suited well for rain. I heard it crumple, a crisp sheet of paper it must have been. He seemed off, I'd never met the man but it felt he was n't in his usual mind. The empty, sunken eyes, furrowed brow, and tight lips neither smiling nor frowning defined a face which had expressed very little in a very long time. A familiar face, you see it in many people, and most often people see it in their mirrors. \n \n `` So what's the reading material you've got tonight?'' \n \n `` Just some scribble, nothing good.'' \n \n `` Ah, must be yours, so you're a writer then.'' \n \n `` I'd like to think so but sometimes I'm not so sure, what tipped you off?'' \n \n `` People are only so critical of themselves, if it were somebody else, you would tell me how wonderful the piece was, or what it means, or just how terrible it was, but tell me why that is. You simply said it was rubbish, with no rhyme or reason, that means it's yours.'' \n \n `` I see. So Sherlock, what bring you to the park tonight?'' \n \n `` Well whenever I drift through these parts I like to stop here, this bench changed my life.'' \n \n `` You ca n't just lay that out there and not tell the story.'' \n \n `` Oh I just wanted to make you ask, more fun that way, as the story it self is n't much of one at all. I was looking at that tree over there, the short fat one, and I saw a bird. Not a noble bird like a cardinal or a bluejay, only a pigeon. Then it flew away. In that action I found no metaphor, no great meaning or purpose, but it gave me an alternate idea to what I'd been thinking at the time, which was a piss poor one I never could have fixed, and by the looks of you you're thinking just the same I was. But that bird, it showed me something else. Leaving is easy. Hell it just flew off, so can I. Sure I could list a reasons all day why not to but they were just excuses. So I dropped it all and flew. I'm still flying, not a bit of fatigue yet, still waiting for the right spot to land. But that's not important, what's important is I rediscovered a reason to fly, it isnt much of a motivational one but it's been working. When I felt I had no reason to live, I mustered up one great act of defiance. Me, so small and insignificant and pointless in the face of everything, I said fuck it. When were growing up, the times when we're most desperately searching for purpose also happen to be the times we're most rebellious. So if we do n't find that reason to go on, so what, live on and love Life. I'd say the only thing worse than living a meaningless life, is dying a meaningless death. One is very final. It does nothing, it truly is pointless. The other however, is infinite. Timeless, never ending, immortal. When you live, you influence. If I convince you to not hang yourself tonight, you'll go on to do something. They do n't have to be remarkable things. Maybe you write a short story some kids like, then those kids become writers. Those writers spread their philosophies and spawn more writers, spread more knowledge, maybe bring about the first benevolent politician, who knows. The point it that you are that tree over there. Yes, the short fat one. But, it has many branches. Branches which reach out wider than any other tree it the park. You, even if you do n't do anything incredible, will still be the cause of an incomprehensible large chain of events through time.'' \n \n `` Damn.'' \n \n `` Damn indeed, the moon is beautiful tonight.'' \n \n `` No not the... oh nevermind'' \n \n \n Edit: Spelling es no bueno\n"}

He was blonde of hair with brilliant blue eyes. An unsullied portrait of our muddled and dark species today. He was an angel and his name was Hildalphous. With his great silver wings, Hildalphous beat back the encroaching black cloth that blanketed our skies. He fought with the breath of a great whale that lived deep in his lungs and the power of an albatross that filled his wings with fury. Day and night, on endless cycle, Hildalphous bravely fought to keep the darkness at bay. \n \n `` But the humans below has little love for this hero. This man, as they believed, was their enemy, for Hildalphous fought to keep the skies the way they were. He was afraid of change. So when the day came when Hildalphous' wings tired and his breath grew short he called for aid from below, but the men only laughed and offered no heed. The men below continued in their ways, polluting our water, our land, our skies. Alone, Hildalphous tired and he fell. His silver wings had become tarnished and weathered, yet as he fell the last ray of sun gleamed off his old body. Then the darkness folded over the world, and the hero was lost to the sharp-toothed beasts below. *'' \n \n Soot stared up at her mother with her large black eyes and Plaster tousled her daughter's hair. It was the same story every night, but it Plaster did n't mind. She loved the way it opened her daughter's eyes with wonder, awakening a truth deep within. A truth neither could prove, but was there all the same. Faith, as it was, unprovable, yet sacred in their hearts. It had been centuries upon centuries since the last human laid eyes upon that blue veil that now hung placidly over the meager existence. Plaster gently kissed her daughter's forehead. \n \n `` Now sleep little muskrat. Tomorrow is the big day.'' \n \n Soot sat up from her grey pillow, `` But mom! That's not how the story ends!'' She had a look on her face as one who had been robbed of something. \n \n Plaster only smiled back, `` That's how it ends tonight, now sleep.'' \n \n Soot, frustrated, fell back onto her pillow. She gave a little whine as well before saying, `` But you forgot about the parts where the hero lands in the din of the sharp-toothed beasts! You forgot about how they tried to tear his beautiful silver wings from him and steal his breath! You even forgot about the part where Hildalphous bathes himself in the light of immolating fire!'' \n \n `` Hush now Soot.'' Plaster replied in a firm motherly tone. She gracefully traced a finger through Soot's long black hair. `` I'll finish the story tomorrow. A good story always leaves the listener in suspense.'' \n \n Soot continued to pout, `` It's not so good when the listener knows the end.'' Under the dim light of the incandescents, Plaster saw that Soot gave her a pouty lip. A last ditch attempt to coax the end from her mother. Plaster only gave her another kiss on the forehead and retreated from Soot's room. \n \n Before she could leave Soot piped up once again, `` Is it true mom? Is it true that the sky is as blue as his eyes and the sun as golden as his hair? Is it true the silver from his wings scattered across the sky in tiny, shimmering shards?'' \n \n At the threshold of Soot's room Plaster turned and gave her a wry wink and a grin, `` I guess you'll have to find out tomorrow.'' Then she was gone into the dim lit hallway, leaving Soot to her dreams and fantasies. \n \n The next morning the shuttle took off in a bright flash of red and orange. Plaster watched it sail up and up into the black clouds. With tears in her eyes she watched the light from the engine fade into the thick pollution. On board the shuttle was Soot and 299 other people, flying headlong for *Haven*, the city in the sky. A paradise creation that floated above the thick pollution. It was determined by lottery who would go, Plaster had won a ticket for herself, but she would never leave her daughter, so she gave it to Soot. \n \n When the rocket finally faded from view, Plaster quietly recounted the end of her story, \n \n *'' Hildalphous fell into the deep dark din of the sharp-toothed beasts. He was weary and hurt from his fall and all around him, the hero could see the beasts come closer. The beasts hissed terrible things at the hero, they laughed at his pathetic and tarnished state, and they licked their slobbering jowls preparing to strike. They went first for Hildalphous' wings, but the tarnished silver held fast again their sharp claws. Then the beasts tried to steal Hildalphous' breath, but their sharp teeth could not pierce his throat. The sharp-toothed things worried at the hero for many days and nights, cutting claw and tooth against Hildalphous. \n \n `` No matter how hard they tried they could not break the man with blonde hair and blue eye. In fact as they continued their savage attack their claws cut away the tarnish from his silver wings, and their teeth worked breath back into the hero's lungs. Then one day Hildalphous stood and tossed back his attackers. In those dark times the sun had already been hidden for years, behind the black pollution, but still Hildalphous' body emanated light. His blonde hair was as golden and as bright as the sun, his blue eyes gleamed in an astounding blue, so deep and beautiful, and his silver wings scattered reflections across the face of Earth. Bathed in the light of the hero the sharp-toothed beast's true nature was revealed. They were man, they were dirty, ugly creatures of filth, and rot, and poison. They bared their horrible teeth at the light and then turned and ran. Back into the darkness that they themselves created. \n \n `` Hildalphous then lit himself aflame. His lustrous increased ten fold and any man near his presence was incinerated. The power of the hero lifted him upward through the black pollution and into the heavens. Hildalphous scattered himself across the sky and in his scattering, he knocked away the black cloth that hung over the Earth. He became the sun, and the sky, and the stars, the light of life. `` * \n \n Plaster sighed to herself. Somewhere high above her daughter would live out her days above this black shroud. She would spend her life in the warmth of the sun.\n"}

Normally, you have to walk on the sidewalk, take a right onto Citadel Avenue and then keep following that and we'll be there, but there's too much of a risk to get seen, so what I'm gon na do is take this back alley, and right when I get to Citadel, I'm gon na take a right, then I'm gon na slip down into the storm drain. Once I'm in the storm drain, I can just go ahead and make my way to the end of the street underground and I'll be golden. \n \n So as I make my way through the alley, I be careful to make sure none of the neighbors see me, so I try to hide behind each trash can, check to see if there's a car coming on Citadel, and when the coast is clear I move. There's a couple of cars that drive past, but none of them are my mom or my brother so I'm in the clear so far. I make it all the way to the storm drain, but my heart skips a beat when I see that old white beater pick-up about half a mile down the road which belongs to none other than my mother. \n \n `` Oh shit!'' \n \n I panicked. I should've gone home that instant and tried to play it off like I was just playing in the backyard and then ask her if I could go. But like an idiot, I tried to squeeze my way into the storm drain. \n \n As her car was rapidly approaching, I was on the verge of tears praying that I could squeeze in there. Then just as she was at the distance where she could perfectly see that the idiot trying to crawl his way into the storm drain was me, I finally slid right through and got into the tunnel underneath! My ribs had rubbed up on the curb above me when I slid through so they hurt a lot, but normally it took me a while to get through, but doing that on the first try was almost a miracle! I was in the clear at this point, there's no way she saw me, she was probably too busy looking at her phone. \n \n So now I made my way through the rancid storm drain. As I was stepping through all the crap and gunk on the floor, I was thinking to myself how nice it would be if I could actually do whatever I wanted without having to worry about my mom being on my back all the time. When I got to like 20 years old, I was going to do whatever I wanted. That's when my life's really gon na begin, I just got ta make it through these next ten years first. \n \n After talking to myself a bit, I realized I was coming up on Ol' Rusty again. When Henry and Alex and I were all down here playing German spies one day, we came across Ol' Rusty and it was the scariest thing I ever saw at the time. It was a dead body that someone stuck down in this tunnel in the storm drain, but no one ever bothered to look for him, so he just stayed down there. It had been two years since that day and Oh hey look, here he is still! At this point the skin has rotten to the point that you can see most of his bones sticking out, and the little bit of skin that's left looks all mushy and soggy. The clothes do n't have much left to them either. His arm had long been washed away, but that was n't the rain or anything natural that did that to him. I remember one day Alex dared me to wear the jacket, so since I had to show him I was n't a girl, I took the jacket off and wrapped around myself. It was the grossest thing I had ever done, and I'm pretty sure that's what caused me to be sick for the next week and a half, but my mom said that it was some sort of flu. Anyways, when I tried to put it back on him, I pulled a little too hard on his arm trying to stuff it back in the sleeve and I actually ripped it off. Alex and Henry called me an idiot, and I tried to put it back on, but like everything else I touched, I ruined it. \n \n Author's Note: Ok so I'm just trying to do a deal with myself where I only type for an hour a day, so I do n't overwhelm myself, and as much as I would love to develop the backstory of Jordan here, It's been 45 minutes at this point already and I have n't even gotten to the part where he made his wish. So I'm gon na have to ditch the part where he laughs at Ol' Rusty for dying and him thinking that he's going to be much better than Rusty, him thinking about just how useless the cops are and how the only time he's ever seen a cop was when they were at school talking about how awesome they were, and skip a memory of his mother abusing him { emphasizing his thoughts on the cops not being there } \n Also I'm gon na have to skip the nerf gun fight in the woods. \n \n So let's skip to where they fall through a weak part in the woods floor { there had been a big storm the day before that weakened it that I would've loved to write about } and after exploring the tunnels below a bit, they find the well. \n \n `` Holy crap! Is that what I think it is?'' \n \n `` What the heck is a well doing down here?'' \n \n While Henry and Alex were stuck in awe, I actually approached it and there was an inscription on it. \n \n `` Hey guys, there's something written here!'' \n \n `` Move over Jordan, let me read that. It says `` Here lays my last hope for humanity. The Wishing Well. I have blessed it with my magic and whoever finds it will have their deepest and truest desires granted. If there is evil in their heart when they, okay this is just stupid.'' \n \n `` Alex keep reading it!'' \n \n `` Shut up Henry, it just says if you're evil then humanity will wither away. Like what's that even supposed to mean?'' \n \n `` I think it means the world will end'' \n \n `` Shut up Jordan no one asked ya.'' \n \n `` Wait dude, let me see that. Wait a minute, was n't there something in social studies where we went over this thing.'' \n \n `` You mean the Wishing Well of Alnthion?'' \n \n `` Yeah Jordan, that Alnthion thingy. Apparently their was a knight who made a wish that he would have the strongest army in that ever existed,'' \n \n `` Oh dude you mean Tyrus the Tyrant? That dude was awesome, he like killed 10,000 people!'' \n \n `` YEAH! Sir Tyrus! Apparently he was the dude that made a wish that he had the strongest army that ever existed, and like ten years later he went to war and conquered all of Europe!'' \n \n \n Alright so I only have like two minutes, so I'm gon na have to wrap it up. I'm sorry for only giving myself an hour, but if I had the ability to finish it, then it would be Alex would wish for what Sir Tyrus wished for and would wish to be the most dominant ruler of the world that ever lived, Henry would wish to be the greatest football quarterback of all time { even better than their hero Champ Currethers } like any normal 10 year old would, but then Jordan, seeing as he would expect his life to be incredible once he could start living for himself, says he'll make the best wish of all and wish for immortality. For once, the gang finally agrees with him and wishes they had thought of that. \n \n But then the rest of the story would show how miserable Jordan's life is, and how it would just continue to become more miserable. Henry would slowly get extremely better and better at football and he gets recruited by the major football schools { Texas, Notre Dame, Oregon, Alabama, etc. } and Alex would slowly become a militaristic mastermind. \n \n However, near the middle of the story, we'd see Jordan at age 20 lose all hope in life. He's at a point where he failed out of college, has seen everyone around him have a romantic relationship when he has n't even so much as hugged a girl, in fact he does n't have a social relationship with anyone really as the last time he had hung out with anyone was when he was forced to go to a food banquet with the football team, and it's looking like he'll never accomplish his dreams. \n \n So he decides to commit suicide which just so happens to be the anniversary that he made his wish. And right as he jumps off of the building and the instant he lands, that's when his wish activates and allows him to survive the fall. So he continues to live, which is the last thing in the world that Jordan wanted to do. \n \n The story would then continue as a redemption story for him, because at this point, Alex got his wish as the most powerful military leader in the known world and he has the world controlled under an iron fist. Throughout the story we've established that he's an empathy-less sociopath that crushes anyone he feels is weak, so he's a Hitler-esque dictator that crushes all who opposes him. So he uses { I should note that when I say football it's american football } football as a propaganda machine led by his best friend Henry Larson star quarterback of the San Diego Riptide in a sort of Panem et circenses, but it's up to Jordan to lead the rebellion with his immortality to overthrow Alex's cruel reign... \n\n"}

The final glorious hours before the fall of an administration that wanted only to bring prosperity to a land of misers and civil war. I was to be their leader, their knight in shining armor to lead them into the light and out of the darkness they themselves had crawled into. For many years, more than I can count, I \u2019 ve led these people, sometimes with whispers of wealth, other times with an iron fist. I could hardly be blamed for the use of force, could I? \n \n I remember all those years ago, just after I took leadership, when a small uprising decided to attack a small village just within the boundaries of my protection, and the small detachment that was sent to dispatch the rebels, but instead opened fire on the few survivors. There was a short period of tension afterwards, but I brought in some of the finest public relations managers to help remind the people of the promises I had originally made. I even reprimanded the soldiers, but not too harshly, I didn \u2019 t want morale to drop even lower among my skeleton crew of an army. \n \n And who could forget the brutal assassination of my closest friend and chief advisor? We had fought valiantly side-by-side to unite the people, and it was only with his guidance that I was able to make it through some dark times, in both my personal and professional lives. There were rumors swirling that the knife was meant for me, that the insurgency I had attempted to squash years prior had grown, slowly but steadily, and that it had insidiously made its way into my own back yard. \n \n After his death, I had no choice; I had to hire a chief of security. Within a week of the grand funeral and the day of mourning, the capital city and all outlying strategic points had been locked down. I never believed in these things, security checkpoints, random search and seizure, and the appalling mass murders carried out by my generals. It was for my security, insisted the chief of security, it also keeps the capital strong and its people safe. I agreed and assured the people through my weekly televised conversations that I would be here to keep them safe for a very, very long time, or that I would die defending the capital and all the ideals that it stood for. \n \n That was a month ago. Now, here, in my luxuriously appointed apartment, I hear the rumblings of uprising outside. The muffled sound of unbridled human fury slowly rising, the gunshots from both sides. My last general informed me that our numbers were dwindling, that it was only a matter of time before the rebels took the capital as their own. I refused to be whisked away in my helicopter to some mountainside cave. I didn \u2019 t work my way up the ladder to abandon my city and her people, and to break all of the promises that I made to them. \n \n I sat at my desk, a glass of my finest reserve whiskey, a delicious Cuban cigar, and, of course, my gold-plated Desert Eagle. A loud bang reverberated through the building, followed by shouts and gunfire. My private guard would hold the rebel scum back for a short while, but it was only a matter of time. I dashed the cigar, and gulped the last of my whiskey before picking up the weapon. I turned it over in my hands as I did on the day I received it. A thing of hideous beauty. Could those be\u2026but no, they couldn \u2019 t be tears dropping onto my desk. El Presidente was a strong man, a man who would go to his grave knowing that his people were taken care of, and that the capital was left to good hands. \n \n But this wasn \u2019 t true. El Presidente was a coward, they would say. A coward who sat in his office with the blast-proof doors locked while his peasant army defended him with its dying breath. History is always written by the victors. The commotion was closing in, fast. Time seemed to slow down as I opened my mouth, and placed the gun inside. The sound of a thousand hands pounding on my door. The click of the hammer readying itself. Goodbye, sweet Imperia, I \u2019 m sorry I couldn \u2019 t give you everything I promised all those years ago. Please know that I did my best, but my achy bones can fight no more. My final gift to you is the freedom that you now fight for. Goodbye. \n\n"}

It seemed as if her every step echoed through the City of the Gods, while her fervent prayers were buried in the silence around her. She paused and looked around. The elegant structures around her swayed in the breeze. Sometimes, they moved against the breeze; other times they twisted and bent. Shimmering clothes of all colors danced in harmony with the homes around her, sometimes serving as walls, and other times coyly revealing tastefully decorated guestrooms. The branches of the great tree painted the city in shadow and light, and the thinly woven path revealed a cloud covered, lush, green world below. The path was thin, but none of the faithful had anything to fear from such a fall. It was beautiful, but to Sonia the colors seemed dim, the dancing homes around her were off beat and the city itself was lifeless. \n \n Everyone was gone. Her ma and the others had probably landed in their new village on the surface. Sonia should have been with them, but she had to see Vreeshwa one last time. \n \n The temple of Wisdom was large, but otherwise humble by the standards of the City. Vreeshwa cared little for ceremony and worship, but she treasured her people. She had taught Sonia everything Sonia knew. Even if the other Gods had abandoned her, Vreeshwa would still be there. She had to. \n \n She was not there. The temple was empty; even the bookshelves were gone. But, floating in the center of the teaching chamber was a single book: `` The Book of Sonia.'' The book was empty, but the moment she saw the book, Sonia remembered Vreeshwa's face and her kindness. She received Vreeshwa's Wisdom. It felt as if she suddenly remembered advice from long ago. \n \n Without hesitating, she grabbed the book and ran to the main square. There she found a small statue of Gohim, God of Fortitude. Once again, Sonia looked at the book and received Vreeshwa's Wisdom. Then she left the temple and walked out into the city that had been her home for 16 years. \n \n The city died quickly. When it did, Sonia fell with it. She tried praying to Shinwa, God of Spirituality, but she could not remember his face, the sound of his voice nor the feeling of the spirits he had named for her. The prayer failed, and she plummeted through the clouds. As the ground approached, she desperately prayed to Gohim. She remembered Gohim's fearless laugh and the unrestrained strength of his arms. Immediately her limbs grew firm and unyielding. Her mind calmed and she carefully watched the ground, using her clothes and the wind to guide herself into a clearing. \n \n CRACK \n \n The pain was mind-numbing, but somehow she was alive. Hugging the figure to her chest, Sonia breathed a prayer of thanks to Gohim. When she touched the book she understood. This pain would define her life, but Vreeshwa would guide her to her fate and Gohim would give her the strength to face it. Not all of the Gods had abandoned her. \n \n *** \n \n Note: *This is part 1 of 3. Any constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated. * \n \n Edit: Added a sentence\n"}

We nodded. The foreman walked out. \n \n `` Water incoming.'' Hank pulled a lever. 20 million gallons of water came flooding into the chamber, 600,000 gallons a second. Last month, the hatch had malfunctioned- a single loose screw in the piping and it was n't watertight anymore. Water got into the wiring, and the maglock system failed. Hatch opened while maintenance was being done on the tank. 6 guys. No survivors. Hank said he'd heard from a guy close to the cleaning team that they'd been blown apart by the rush of water- like being hit by a train. \n \n `` Second load incoming.'' Hank pulled another lever. The whales started tumbling out of hatches high in the chamber's ceiling. \n \n The tank was n't completely full yet. We were supposed to let the water reach half-capacity, then dump the whales. This way, they hit the surface of the water and are stunned. If they're thrashing around too much, or even getting a chance to swim too freely, the whales coming in will just land on top of them and not sink quickly enough. They have to sink quickly or the whole chain gets backed up, all the way back to the breeding tanks. They screamed as they fell. A minute later, the tank was so full of whales they could hardly turn around. \n \n `` It's the sound, I think,'' I said to Hank. `` Like, the wailing.'' \n \n `` You mean whaling?'' \n \n We both chuckled. Neither of us wanted to. \n \n `` Thresher incoming,'' I said. \n \n Last rotation, about three months ago, I got to leave the compound and head back home. I took my kid to a pet store. He asked me what work was like and I told him it was fine- not too different from his mother's work with elephants. He asked what it looked like, since we were n't allowed to take pictures. I showed him one of the fishtanks, the kind with all those guppies swimming about where they have no room, and they're just fucking and eating each other all day. Like that, but more guppies I said. \n \n My hand was on the lever and I was about to pull, but Hank stopped me. `` Look.'' He pointed at the door. The foreman walked in, followed by a bunch of suits. Our backs straightened. \n \n `` Here we have the grinding phase- looks like they're just about to process another batch! Gentlemen?'' \n \n `` Thresher incoming,'' I said again. I pulled the lever. You could n't see the blades, but you could hear them start turning underneath the floor. It was a really smooth sound, more like a fan than a jet engine. Still loud. \n \n `` Grind incoming'' \n \n Hank and I grabbed two keys in the panel and turned them at the same time. The floor started opening up, exposing the blades of the thresher. The foreman started talking, his voice just beneath a shout so that the suits could hear him. \n \n **'' As you can see, the floor of the chamber opens as an aperture to ensure even flow. The blades are actually one of the most expensive parts of the whole system. They're specially designed to slice extremely clean, minimizing froth so as to prevent waste, and ensuring the whales are killed humanely. `` ** \n \n `` Ceiling incoming,'' Hank said. \n \n **'' Now, our state-of-the-art hydraulic system will push the ceiling down into the chamber, compressing every square inch of space. The ceiling is capable of exerting 4 million pounds of pressure at any given point- more than enough given how effective simply draining the chamber into the grind is, but far more efficient in terms of how many batches we can get per day. `` ** \n \n The first of the whales had sunk to the bottom. It was one-inch chunks surrounded by red mist in two seconds- you could hardly see the convulsing. \n \n The one right after fell in tail first. \n \n One of the suits spoke up: `` What's done about the water that drains with the whales?'' \n \n **'' The meat-water slurry is drained into the level below, where it's carefully dried out via heating. The air is sucked into a condensation chamber, and the remaining water is purified and recycled. We yield roughly 96 % of the original water, requiring little re-filling. It's the most eco-friendly system on earth for our product. `` ** \n \n The suits ooh'd and ah'd as they applauded. The whales kept howling. \n \n **'' Now, let's go see the drying process. `` ** \n \n They all shuffled out the other end of the room. \n \n `` I always feel worst for the ones at the top,'' I told Hank. `` They do n't get usually stunned. And they get pushed into the blades.'' \n \n `` Yeah, I guess they have it the worst.'' \n \n By the time the chamber was half-way finished, all the water was red. Not so thick you could n't see through it, but definitely darker than a strong pink. The howling was starting to quiet down. \n \n It was barely a minute before the tank was empty. \n \n `` Resetting chamber.'' I pulled the last lever. The ceiling pulled back up to its place at the top of the tank, and hoses by the blades shot out air, stripping the thresher of leftovers. The chamber looked just as pristine as before. \n \n `` I'm thinking of requesting a transfer into breeding,'' Hank said, readjusting all the levers. I sighed. \n \n `` Water incoming.''\n"}

Who was coming. I \u2019 ve known for a while now. I made my peace a long time ago, yet now the moment is so close I still feel anxious. I \u2019 ve got plenty of fond memories, plenty of regrets. I wouldn \u2019 t change any of the choices I made however \u2013 one should never want to change a choice they made to the best of their ability at the time. Yet I \u2019 ve still got a little time left. One last footnote in my story. \n \n I know his face well. Once so innocent, his eyes full of wonder. Perhaps I should not have taken him in, not have taught him. My actions perhaps have doomed the lives of many. Perhaps they also saved many. No one knows what the future would bring - but ending. The one eternal law of existence. Or perhaps he will prove me wrong. He will see \u2013 I will not. \n \n I rise from bed \u2013 old bones creaking, joint aching, muscles straining. Too old. Perhaps I lived too long. When you are young, time feels endless. As you grow older, you wish for more time to do what you always wanted, to fix your mistakes. Yet when you are truly old, you start to wonder whether you truly needed all that time. Whether what you sacrificed for it was truly worth it. \n \n I walk to the door, like I have so many times. It does not go as easy as it once did. I walk the hallway \u2013 was I always out of breath when I reached the end? The boy sees me. Not a boy anymore, a man grown now, yet always a boy to me. My boy. I hide my weariness. He worries too much. He stands to help me. I hide my weariness \u2013 no need to trouble him over an old man. He helps me sit and I begin to talk. \n \n I talk of many things. Of stars and supernova \u2019 s, of ants and men, of history and future. Victory and defeat. My greatest moments, my largest failures. He heard some of it before. Not all. Some shocks him, some scares him. Some bring him joy. I find myself shedding tears as I talk about my regrets. I tell of secrets that should never be spoken, knowledge perhaps better forgotten. Knowledge I thought was safe with me. I once believed I would last forever, that I could keep my universe safe forever. \n \n It is a cruel thing perhaps, to force so much on someone so young, someone who never got a true choice. Perhaps I took him in for too selfish a reason. Perhaps the world will go on like normal when I am gone. Perhaps not. I can not be sure, but I must be. I wish I could stay longer, be there for him. I grow tired. I must at least tell him the last lesson, the same one I was taught but never truly learned. \n \n \u2018 \u2019 remember \u2019 \u2019 I said, \u2018 \u2019 live your life like every moment matters. Nothing lasts forever. \u201d \n \n Did he learn? I do not know. I did not. I felt immortal at that age. A moment seemed so short. So pointless. I wish I used them better now. Did anyone learn at that age? Will he still need to learn or will his time truly not run out? There is so much I still wanted to do. Still wanted to say to people. Chances never taken. I see him cry. I do not like to see him sad. \n \n I feel so tired. So empty. My soul feels so heavy, and yet, so light. The world grows dark \u2013 yet he still shines bright. I lie down. I find it hard to breathe. I have done all I need to. All I can do. I close my eyes for the very last time. I feel the darkness take me. Accept me as one of their own. As I slip at last into the sweet embrace of death, I think of him. Imperfect, yet he makes me feel so proud. The last thought on my mind: \n \n \n Go forth and conquer your own universe.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A nuclear post-apocalyptic Utopia\n","story":"The sky had remained blue. It had felt alien, when so much had changed - more alien than the titanic dark hexagon glistening beneath the summer sun far up in the cerulean void. \n \n Gyyshk squinted at that patch of darkness in blue, a splinter of sarcasm and disbelief lodged deep into his brain and then turned his attention back to the dromul. The creature writhed in his hands as he inspected it, suction cups trying to pluck at the carbonit weave of the technologist's skin. The little bastard was healthy, and probably simulated illness to get a treat. Dromuls were notoriously clever, even a bit too much for Gyyshk's taste - lose concentration and they're flattening out to slip between the skin plates, running amok untill the systems hit the ammonia spray. Three ganglions stretched across their oblong bodies, multi-threading to allow them their sonar navigation through the salty soil - a wonderous production of Hader Biotech labs, almost ready to integrate into the wild. \n \n Patting the dromul on its side, Gyyshk released it, watching the animal slink into the glassy surface of the test site, and then stood up. The enclosure door shuttered behind him and Gyyshk wandered out, to fully bask in the heat of the Caspian basin. \n \n The population seemed healthy, and he breathed evenly as the data from the inspection sifted through his fingertips, molecules of tissue and secretion particles deploying into synthassemblers grafted to Gyyshk's heavily augmented nervous system. He could practically feel the protocol from today's inspection congeal into neatly layered research reports somewhere behind his frontal lobe as the scattered combi-brain implants began gigafying it to the closest lab servers. \n \n Though the analytical trance, Gyyshk smelled a visitor. \n \n `` How's the dromules?'' \n \n Uyygat was an archaist, it was evident even in his stench. With the DFC Consortium rolling out their new, cutting-edge visifiers, some - like Uyygat - had their teenage protest bloom into this silly retrocomm habit. Idly, Gyyshk wondered if the Zenerk Collective had some mirror form of such foolery... if they stopped their wild experiments with mycorize networks, and decided to, say, watch some television for a change. Well oh well, the War Eternal be praised - if the chief biochemist Uyygat wanted to *speak*, he would oblige. \n \n With a cold hiss, Gyyshk's motorized faceplates vibrated, tensed on the thin miofibre stands, and then slid open, to reveal him smiling at his old friend. Uyygat's face had similarly shattered naked, and the chalky whitness of his skin glistened in harmonized synchornicity with the alabaster globules of the Hader Labs complex behind him, their forms hazing and pulsing from the day's heat. \n \n `` Two weeks old and already hunting'', Gyyshk beamed, gripping his friend's outstretched hand. His head snapped to the enclosure. `` Not entirely successful, but they'll be a good pred for the system''. \n \n `` You guys are sure keeping it up. Giving the zenerk a run for their money - and they got the Amazonian sinks to work with... Met Juuk the other day at the veear pools, she was so unpatriotically raving about their work'', Something sly and dark passed in the shade of Uyygat's face. `` If it was n't the p-phase, she would've gotten the needle, heh''. \n \n Gyyshk waved his hand dismissively. For the Venerxt, biomolding and genefacturing had always took a backseat to their robotics and augmentation specialities, as well as cityscaping, and so everyone in the field, him included, always felt a bit too protective of their work in Europe and the Middle East. After all, they themselves were a testament to the venerxt chops concerning those technlogies. \n \n `` Root-huggers, eh'', Gyyshk dusted his legs off. His transmitters were beating a frantic stacatto around Uyygat's infospace, but all he could pick up was basic vitality data and public stim-net outpourings about what he had for breakfast. The technologist grimaced slightly. Archaism was getting *old*, and he hated the pun. `` Who cares. P-phase ends in like, 10 years. By that time we'll have a stable ecosystem here...'' \n \n Further accentuating the point, Gyyshk punched his friend's side slightly - hand mostly bare, talons tucked in. \n \n `` With none of *your* help, obviously. Seriously, Uyyg, it's ten in the morning, are n't you supposed to be slaving away somewhere in Lab C with your stunted, glitchy Springsilence neuropal, on some useless DNA mockup that a zenerk could shit out in his half-brain sleep?'' \n \n Uyygat looked hurt - the golden glow of printed optics inside his iris dulled in mock sadness. He motioned Gyyshk to stroll with him, and the two men left the test zone. Stepping onto a narrow concrete path, they moved towards the lab complex, and Gyyshk basked in the bleak, roiling sun, the carbonit scales of his smart-skin synching and splaying upwards to dissipate the heat. \n \n `` Ah, Gyyshk, the person with an audacity to insult an AI. Tell me again, how did you even graduate?'' \n \n `` They were smitten by my looks, of course. The rugged charm of a w-phase veteran, the mighty glial fusions on my combi axons, the scars?'' \n \n This time, Uyygat laughed. The technologist, for all his introversion, was good with linguistics - and he enjoyed it with people nowadays. \n \n `` That's why I'm here. Thought that we could take a jet to Dubai some evening, hit the arcologies. You know the routine - substances, stim-net, maybe a few zenerk females to make things lethal enough to upload a backup?'' \n \n Gyyshk knew. He knew precisely the substance - the black, tar-like ooze coiled in his stomach, infiltrating the systems, pumping the interweaving flesh and augs, the thought-broadcasts and gigafy streams with an insatiable urge. It was always within him, dissolving into an aerosol poison with every burst of pheromones and breath, interlocking them within an evolving, inevitable solution. \n \n Ten years until the end of p-phase. With their current lifespans, it was, in all honestly, a flicker. Everyone felt the taste of the *W* on the tips of their tongues and fingers, earning to blossom beautifully and violently in a symphony of overclocked adrenal glands. \n \n\n"}

I tried to distract myself from his ramblings by taking a drink from the cooler in the corner all the while he continued to rant about all of this. \n \n As I finished pouring the contents into the plastic cup and took a sip'it' had calmed down some and glanced over at me lazily. That was perhaps the scariest thing in all honesty about the'doctor' the range of emotions but something was off about the way he was looking at me now `` But you know, they're gon na want more answers eventually...''

Melissa snapped at him. \n \n She had been contemplating suicide for some time after her husband ran off with another woman, unable to work because of the pregnancy that forced him into the marriage just 4 months prior. Unable to work and lacking any family to support her, she lost her home and had nowhere to go, and after losing a steady food supply, had a miscarriage.

Melissa turned away from the cliff to talk to him, for some reason this man's understanding calmed her, and she started to reconsider. \n \n `` Well, that's definitely rough.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Suddenly across the globe , large , feathered , rotted corpses begin to drop out of the sky . They are soon identified to be Angels .\n","story":"Perpetual darkness. The dark grey clouds overhead were heavy with rain, a storm looming ever near. Yet no rain fell. The skies have been this way for so many years people have lost count. The sun is almost forgotten, a fable told to children. Chaos grew and has thrived in the lights absence. Men have gone mad with power, and unfounded anger flowed through their veins. The world was dying and all was well in the minds of the powerful. \n \n All of the lands burned and none seemed to care, they just wanted war. Rowan found himself at the front line of an army he did n't follow, a leader he knew not, yet there he stood. Across the empty field the opposing force gathered their strength before the charge. A brown and white blur darted across his view, a man shouting orders on horseback, waving a flag Rowan did n't know. The rider turned toward the challengers and raised his sword, `` Forward! Death! Chaos!'' \n \n The men around Rowan lurched forward and he followed. His shield was suddenly too heavy to carry and he fumbled with it, but it had been hammered around his hand so it could n't be removed. His sword had been melted into his gauntlet to keep it from being dropped. He continued forward. The rider sprinted ahead yelling words and swinging his mace around his head, it almost sounded like he was laughing. The rider met the solid wall of the enemy and was felled without pause as the two sides continued. \n \n The two walls met with a loud clap and men began to fight. The man to Rowan's left had his head separated before he could swing. He caught a glimpse of the lifeless eyes as the head rolled towards him. What light came from above was suddenly darkened by a hail of arrows. The shield took them all but he could feel the weapons pierce through to his arm. The pain was horrendous, but the enemy in front pushed on. He blocked a swing and ran through an enemy as an ally leaped over his back and slammed his own shield down onto a head, crushing it. The sound made him want to vomit. He knelt down and heaved as a dark shadow came over him. A laughing man dressed in all black and brown stood over Rowan laughing crazily. His eyes were bloodshot and he had dark rings of sleep under his eyes. He raised his axe and and laughed again. \n \n A loud blast from a trumpet broke the field. The man fell to his knees screaming, Rowan did as well. He tried to cover his ears but he could n't reach. Men all around shrieked and screamed in pain, their ears all bleeding. The trumpet blasted again, its sound ripped over the men knocking them down flat. Again, again, again it roared above them. Six times it blasted, then silence. \n \n The clouds shook and rumbled with thunder as it began to rain, the rain was large and heavy but fell slow, as if being held aloft by hands. Rowan's eyes we wet with tears but it looked so beautiful. The rain fell closer until it landed softly on the ground, the rain was not water but bodies, hundreds and hundreds of bodies. The sky lightened for a moment and Rowan crawled to the nearest. It had what used to be white feathered wings sprouting from its back, now blackened by smoke. The face was frozen in a look of shock and dread. Its body was covered in gashes and fresh cuts, but many more scars showed. \n \n The trumpet blasted once more and all of the bodies turned to ash blowing away in the wind. Rowan looked up to see the clouds growing thick and darker than ever before. The clouds lowered towards them and it was only now that he could see them for what they were. Dark wings and dark bodies bound together tightly by silver rope. The clouds lowered to the ground and hovered for a moment. Men stood and some approached, some cried and some ran, but it mattered not for the rope broke and the beings erupted forward. Rowan tried to raise his shield but he was knocked over by one. It stood on his chest and began pointing towards the sky, speaking a language he did n't know. Then it looked down at him, its eyes were red flames and just the sight made Rowan's armor burst into flame. The being stood still, watching the human melt and roast. The screams were *beautiful*. It walked forward smiling, behind it the light dimmed and faded until there was nothing left but the darkness. \n\n"}

The law dictates that a single language is enough for a single person. It is based on the misguided belief that to speak a second language, one must invite a demon within themselves, for the human mind ca n't handle more than one language. I know that this is a lie, that my mind remains my own. I also know that it is very tiring to maintain five separate lives, all in secret from each other, and the government. \n \n I stroll down the street, and see Vladimir walking the other way. I slip into the Russian mindset. We stop next to each other. \n \n `` \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044f'' I say, eager to carry on. I have work in a short while, and I ca n't let Vlad hold me up for too long. He greets me in return, and we chat briefly, but I glance at my watch, and tell him that I really need to go now. We say our goodbyes, and I rush to work. Ahh, time for the French to come out. \n \n Most of my co-workers are French. Due to language problems, you tend not to see too many people work in a place who do n't speak the owners language. I get to my desk, and to my delight, I see Jean already there. He's a bilingual. I caught him talking German to some strangers once. After that, I learned the language myself, and we became great friends. I look around, cautiously, and go over to him. \n \n `` Guten Tag, Jean.'' He smiles back at me, and perhaps somewhat wisely, he replies in French. \n \n `` Bonjour, \u00e7a va?'' \n \n `` \u00c7a va bien, merci. Et toi?'' \n \n And so on. We banter as we work, and afterwards, we leave together, and go to a German bar. I think that they serve the best beers, and that's based on five different nationality's bars. I love coming here with Jean. It's always a great night. Well, almost always. Tonight, for some reason, a few Russians decided to come here. Maybe to start a fight, maybe just to drink. I do n't know. What I do know, is that Vladimir is the one at the front of the group. As I turn to look at the group, we recognise each other. \n \n Unthinking, I let out the first swear that comes to mind. `` Shit.'' Well, now I've completely screwed myself. Sure, Jean knew that I spoke English, but everyone else in the pub nearly dropped their beer, and the Russians did a double take, especially Vlad. He looked wounded, as if he could n't believe that I would break the law, and not trust him enough to tell him. My life is falling to pieces. I stand up, and walk to the door, quietly. \n \n The second the door is closed behind me, I run. I run to the place I go when I'm in trouble. The church. I walk in, sweat dripping from my brow, the smell of German beer on my breath. I walk past everyone else in the church, and sit in the second row, collecting myself. I kneel down, and begin to pray in Latin, the language of the church. I pray fervently, hoping, beyond hope, that I had n't been reported, that Vladimir would forgive me, and above all that I would remain safe. \n \n I knew that such a selfish prayer would fall upon deaf ears, the only ears that God would spare for such a selfish prayer. Yet still I prayed. I was still praying when the government official walked in, and sat next to me. \n \n `` I may not understand what you're saying, but I know that you understand me. Listen to me very carefully, but do n't let anyone else here know what I'm saying. Would n't want these religious types to believe you possessed by a demon now would we?'' \n \n He's talking as if to himself, but his words can be directed at none other than me. I continue my prayers, only half paying attention to them. He has the rest of my focus. \n \n `` Contrary to popular belief, we do n't punish polyglots, we employ them. Those who are more willing to break the rules are more useful to us. Those who have the capacity to learn multiple languages, have the capacity to better lead us. If my observations today are correct, you can speak five different languages, and that makes you one of the smartest men on the planet, and one of the most useful. You could go far. Of course, if you do n't want to work for use, then I'm sure that you'll find prison very much to your liking. I'm going to be waiting for you just outside, and I want a'yes' or a'no'. Will you work for us? Your choice.'' \n \n He gets up, and walks out. I stay for a short while, but my choice is no choice at all. I get up, and walk out after him. He's leaning against the door, smoking. I see the gun on his belt. I swallow. He looks at me, a hand going to his gun. I clear my throat, even though I do n't really need to. I look him in the eyes. \n \n `` I'll do it.''\n"}

Nothing came out. \n \n The party broke apart after that in confusion, and I retreated to my room. \n \n A few weeks later, it started. The Encouragement. The first time, it was at school, during lunch. A friend tried building me up, tried telling me that I'm a great person, that I deserve to be happy and part of it all. She started singing two years ago, and never pressured me to join in before, she knew I'd join in when I was ready. \n \n As it was, the whole table joined in, and by the final chorus, even the lunch ladies were belting out the refrain. They all gathered around me, like I was the middle of some ridiculous human flower, pointing arms at me in unison as my cue. \n \n I opened my mouth and the noise that came out might have been mistaken for a startled chicken. \n \n After that, it became a trend. That song followed me everywhere; somehow everyone knew it, the tune that defined my life. \n \n People would whistle the tune whenever I passed them. \n \n On the bus, they murmured the refrain, in the classroom or on the train. I ignored the song as best I was able, but in time, I felt it was making me unstable. I could never manage to sing along, but the pressure was getting far too strong. In my room, I practiced scales, like rocking chairs on cats' tails. \n \n But whenever I came into a song on the street, I bumped into dancers and tripped over my feet. I enrolled in lessons for poise and grace, but more and more I hid my face. \n \n I felt I was on the cusp of madness. I stopped socializing, I stayed away from people as best I could. I barely spoke to anyone. \n \n Years passed, and the `` encouragement song'' faded; people came to accept that I was odd. \n \n When I turned 21, I spent my birthday alone. I'd always wanted to try drowning my sorrows in alcohol. I ca n't even break into song properly while drunk. I tried. I watched my recording the next morning, and deleted it immediately afterwards. \n \n This feels like cheating, but I did find a solution, eventually. \n \n I write my own songs in advance now. I write them and learn them, and practice by myself. And if I find a situation that fits the song, I stand up by myself and sing them. \n \n The best part is that everyone else somehow does n't know the words, so they do n't join in, they ca n't dance, and they look at me in confusion. It feels like a petty revenge, but it is all I have. \n \n I am the world's only soloist.\n"}

Ok... if I am in Brissilion Elementary, that makes this... 1996. Oh crap. Is this really happening? You mean I have to go through another nine years of school? Well, at least I seem to remember everything from the... *future*. I shudder, this ca n't be happening. I can not be going through this period of my life again.\n"}

I began to wonder if presenting this idea to him was a good idea. It's not like I had a choice. The group I work for, the Forgettables, would never let me live through the night if I do n't get a yes out of one of these major studios today. \n \n `` Yes Mr. Michum.'' I replied. `` The thing is, it's not just the mercs. Our thought is to get some really big names like Vyllestry Allone, Reginald Schwartzkopf, and The Stone to play the lead roles.'' \n \n `` Ok, but what's the story about Mike.'' said John. `` No one wants to see a movie with old actors running around like Bambo killing people. I do n't think it will make much money.'' John was sitting idly at this point tapping a pencil on his desk. `` And let's be honest, it does n't seem like people are really into this kind of thing anymore.'' \n \n I thought about it for moment. He was right. Most people do n't care for movies like that anymore. Maybe in the 80's it would have been as popular as neon socks with short shorts on men. But its the year 2014. Most people want substance. Then it hit me... \n \n `` Ok then Mr. Michum. I get it.'' I was hoping he would n't see through my deception before I even started. `` We will just take this back to NGN Studios with their initial offer. `` They particularly thought the funny side of it was what would sell out.

What is our take?''. \n \n Bingo. \n \n `` We do n't need any money. And MackBack needs to do nothing...'' I said watching Johns eyes light up at the news to that. ``... except to convince the talent that it may be a great way to either restart their careers or go out with a bang.'' I stood their quietly letting him chew on it. \n \n `` That's it? Seriously, that is it? Why ca n't you just do that yourself?'' He asked bluntly... and that was a good question. One which I already had the answer to. \n \n `` We need the legitimacy of a large studio.'' I told him. I already discussed this with the rest of the organization. If the movie was released from a large studio, it would relegate our organization to just being based off a movie should we ever be'discovered' by conspiracy theorists. `` What would people think of a movie released by an indie studio. The best we would get is a spotlight at the Sundance Film Festival. No credibility like that.'' \n \n And he bought it. I could tell by the look in his eyes. Not like it was a lie either.

Thats when everything changed ...\n","story":"It was bitterly cold, the wind seeped through my winter layers, wherever it touched felt wet. I cradled my daily Chai Latte close to my chest, protecting it as though it were the last ember of a dying fire, the only warmth to be had on my bleak trek to the center of town. \n \n Just another Monday, like any other. Gray, desolate, the hollow promise of a satisfying life had been slowly fading as the years dragged on, and the last of its protective layer is flaking away from my soul as I write this. \n \n Ever since my early childhood I had been intrigued by fiction. Fantastical stories of future scientific wonders, age old myths of gods, and dragons. Heroes overcoming any odds to bring safety and light to the cold and unforgiving world. I lost myself in novels and stories, let myself forget the reality that I would never be Hercules, never travel with Professor Otto Lidenbrock to the depths of our planet. \n \n After these many years of school, hard work, failed relationships, and everything else the slow creeping death of adulthood gifts to us, my inner flame of hope has been battered into submission. It's nearly gone now, though the pilot light of my fantasies still burns, somewhere inside me. I know this because it blossoms into a roaring furnace of happiness and dream when I fall asleep. \n \n Despite the constant crushing feeling of the steamroller of life compressing me into a cardboard-flat puzzle piece in the landscape of humanity, I continue. I still walk to work every day, I sit at my desk, I look at the numbers that I went to school for so long to be able to read. I do my job. \n \n On this particular Monday, which I had thought was like any other Monday, something peculiar happened. As I was forging my path through the frigid streets I was assaulted by the screaming of what seemed to be a living conglomerate of rough brown blankets. As I scrutinized the woolly folds, a brown, deeply wrinkled face materialized. It reminded me of a walnut. I tuned out the inane ramblings about conspiracies, aliens, Obama and Putin's love affair, and whatever else the obviously ailing mind was ejecting through its toothless maw. I had planned to keep walking but a silvery glint from the blanket-ball caught my eye, and I stopped to examine it. As I moved in a little closer, the man, or woman, I could n't really tell through the layer of grime on it's face, slowly pushed the blankets back from it's head to reveal a marvelously crafted tin foil hat. \n \n The creature in the blanket pile began to regale me with a tale of how the metallic headpiece had protected him from the machinations of the secret alien empire living under the earth's crust, and as I had no particular interest in going to work, I listened. As the story unfolded, my pilot light began to swell, maybe it could be real... I decided that no, it's not possible. Near the end of the enthralling yarn, it petitioned me to put on the hat, assuring me that I would see the truth, if I would only wear the foil. I politely declined, and decided I should be on my way, I would n't want to get fired. \n \n I only made it a few feet before feeling the impact of 200 lbs of wool and human flesh ramming into my back, slamming me into the ground. Grubby fingers clawed at my hood and plaid scarf, tearing them from my head and neck, and I felt the freezing crinkle of aluminum replace them, the woolbeast leapt off my back and screamed `` now SEEEE!'' \n \n I shakily stood up, eyes shut tight. What if it was real, I did n't feel any different, but what will I see when I open my eyes? I felt the warmth of hope welling in my breast as I slowly raised my reluctant lids. Now, with my eyes fully open, I did see. I saw everything. I took it all in, and it was all the same. Shivering pedestrians, cars inching along in gridlock traffic, and a crazy homeless person waving their arms and jumping up and down next to me. A gust of wind blew the tin foil hat off my head and into oblivion. I slowly raised my eyes to the grey sky, braced my self, and sighed as my pilot light flickered and went out.\n"}

My brother was a little more adventurous, and he had my father make him a customized bow and arrow. My brother had always taken to my fathers business more than myself, he loved the idea of creating newer, better weapons. \n \n It wasn \u2019 t until 2047. I remember it like it was yesterday, president Farrow made the announcement at the UN. \u201c The greatest leaders of this world have come together, and we have unanimously agreed that there is a problem. \u201d Different world leaders sat in their chairs, hiding behind the name tags belonging to their countries. \u201c The earth is no longer a suitable place to live.

There would only be one opportunity to make it work, and the window for error was quite small.

Best of luck to you all. \u201d \n \n President Farrow left the stage to applause, he must \u2019 ve been thinking that he \u2019 d just made a major mark on human history. However, that was the day he slowly started destroying it. \n \n People at first were excited about the opportunity, that anyone, anywhere may get the chance to be among the chosen few. Then people started considering their odds, and well, they didn \u2019 t like their chances. It started off subtle, but people began to notice the birthrate declining at an alarming pace. Researchers learned that people decided to reproduce less to increase their odds. The population started declining less than a year later, but the odds for some still weren \u2019 t good enough. \n \n Murders started happening everywhere, and pretty soon, your birthday was more secret than even your social security number. Gangs started popping up, a lot of them with exactly 365 members, one for each day of the year. This gave them an incentive to work together, as they slowly increased their odds one by one. Every day on the news you would here what the population for each day was, and every day you would know your odds. It wasn \u2019 t until very normal people became murdering maniacs, that the world became overly concerned. \n \n Every country declared a state of emergency, and within 10 years you would \u2019 ve thought the zombie apocalypse happened. No one was walking the streets, there were abandoned cars covering the roads, and most cities were now in ruins. \n \n I don \u2019 t blame my father, he had a tough decision to make, and I probably would have made the same one in his place. There wasn \u2019 t a place for both my brother and I on the Kepler shuttle, so he had to choose one. He didn \u2019 t have the heart to kill me himself, and so he left me. I woke up to the car driving away, seeing the face I \u2019 d grown to know as my own riding away with it.

We will bring you more updates as they come in. \u201d She signed off. \n \n Leaning back in my chair I spoke softly to myself again, \u201c I always knew it would be you. \u201d I pulled my hat down over my head, and fell asleep.\n"}

I'm not the Santa Claus of Reddit, I ca n't be everywhere at once.'' \n \n Bridgette's gaze flicked onto him so unexpectedly that Satan noticed too late the picture she snapped of him. `` Yeah, that's a meme if I ever heard one.'' \n \n Beelzebub peeked over her shoulder as blocky white text appeared across the scorching image of his sullen face. Between fangs, he pouted. `` Even you have to admit it's a cheap shot.'' \n \n Suddenly she was next to him, her spine pressed lightly into the burning flesh of his naked chest. The small white screen floated before his eyes between her palms. `` There, you see that? That's my fucking karma, big boy.'' \n \n Suddenly Satan did n't know what to do with hands. `` Is that for real?'' \n \n `` Just from this post. I'm telling you, they fucking love you.'' She smiled sweetly, looked up into his face, and snapped a selfie. \n \n The Lord of the Flies stared blankly at the girl in his arms, then seemed to finally find his tongue. `` I think my eyes were closed. Get another.''\n"}

Hope\n","story":"\u201c Oh my poor John, \u201d Eisbeth said, closing the door behind her. She rushed across the chamber to the man who hung from the chains in the middle of the room. Blood ebbed and oozed from his most recent wounds, softening the scabs of older ones as it dripped down his torn flesh. He was breathing, but didn \u2019 t stir. Not even when she touched his arm on one of the few spots that wasn \u2019 t lacerated, bruised, or broken. \n \n \u201c John. John? \u201d \n \n He didn \u2019 t move. She sighed and placed her hand on his forehead. Energy appeared, wispy and ethereal; surrounding her hand and his head both. As she concentrated, the flows of white and gold began submerging into the man \u2019 s skin. Probing deeper. Spreading out across his broken form as it hung from the chains. Finally he groaned. \n \n \u201c John? \u201d \n \n His eyes fluttered open, and she smiled as they focused on her. Carefully she lowered her hand to his cheek. The energy began fading as he took a deep breath that shuddered with effort. And rattled around in his chest painfully. \n \n \u201c John? Hi, hello, \u201d Eisbeth said, caressing his face. \u201c Remember me? \u201d \n \n \u201c Elizabeth? \u201d \n \n \u201c Close enough, \u201d she said, very carefully not shrugging. \n \n \u201c You need to \u2026 get out of here, \u201d John wheezed. \u201c Just run. Before they come back. They \u2019 ll take you. Torture you. \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m here to help you, \u201d she said. \n \n \u201c No \u2026 run. \u201d \n \n \u201c Shhh, it \u2019 s fine, \u201d she said, patting his cheek tenderly. \u201c They \u2019 re busy with something else. I \u2019 m here to help. \u201d \n \n \u201c How? \u201d \n \n \u201c I got in touch with your people. They \u2019 ll be coming to get you out. All you have to do is hold on. Can you do that for me? For them? Hold on a little longer? \u201d \n \n He blinked against a trickle of blood that was descending through one of his eyebrows. She smeared it away with her thumb, before it could start exploring his eye. \u201c The Agency? \u201d he asked. \n \n \u201c Yes, the Agency. They \u2019 re already on their way. It \u2019 ll just take them some doing to fight through the outer defenses. So, whatever these bastards do to you, just hang on a little longer. And everything will be okay. \u201d \n \n He nodded, the barest of movements; but she saw it. There was a glow of acknowledgement in his tired eyes as he met hers. \u201c They won \u2019 t break me. \u201d \n \n \u201c Good, \u201d she nodded, then looked over her shoulder. \u201c I \u2019 ve got to hide. Before they come back. So I \u2019 m ready to open the inner security layers up when your people are in position. \u201d \n \n \u201c Go, \u201d he said, sagging against the chains. But his eyes stayed open, like he was diverting most of his energy into them. Instead of his body. \u201c Don \u2019 t worry about me. \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay. Stay strong, \u201d Eisbeth said, patting his cheek again. \u201c I love you. \u201d \n \n \u201c I love you. \u201d \n \n She walked around behind him. Her form shimmered abruptly, and by the time she walked through the wall like it wasn \u2019 t there her blonde hair and voluptuous curves had become brunette and a harder, leaner, slimmer body. In the hallway on the other side of the torture chamber, she straightened her beret and walked briskly until she reached a doorway that stood open. \n \n \u201c Well? \u201d \n \n \u201c He \u2019 ll talk, \u201d Eisbeth told the man who \u2019 d turned to her. He was the only one standing; everyone else present was seated around a table, studying a map. They all wore berets identical to hers, though that was the only uniformity in their attire. Which ranged from a mishmash of military fatigues to simple jeans and shirts. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re sure? \u201d \n \n She nodded. \u201c I am. You might have to step up your efforts on him, maybe get really creatively cruel, but he \u2019 ll talk. \u201d \n \n \u201c Good, \u201d the man said, clenching his fist. \u201c Then we \u2019 ll have the location of their headquarters, and can strike directly at them. \u201d \n \n \u201c Power to the people, \u201d Eisbeth said, clenching her own fist. \n \n \u201c Power to the people! \u201d everyone in the room immediately echoed. \n \n \u201c One issue. He got a warning out, just before you captured him. You should step up your security and defense patrols, just in case his people come looking to retrieve him. \u201d \n \n \u201c They will not penetrate this base unless they \u2019 re prepared to level the city. \u201d \n \n \u201c I just thought you should know everything. \u201d \n \n \u201c Good work, \u201d the man told her with a nod. \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s why I take the tough ones, \u201d she said, smiling. \u201c Speaking of which, I need to return a call to the Sacramento cell. They \u2019 ve got a tough one of their own. \u201d \n \n \u201c Go. We \u2019 re fine here. \u201d \n \n She nodded and left the room. In the hallway, she looked around, then closed her eyes. When she opened them, she was in a different hallway. Her clothing had changed to a crisp uniform, beribboned and hung with rank insignia. She straightened her name tag, then strode toward the nearest corner. Turning left, she walked down to a set of double doors at the end, guarded by a pair of identically uniformed guards. They nodded to her; one opening the doors. \n \n \u201c General. \u201d \n \n \u201c Major Ells, \u201d a tall woman with four stars on her shoulder boards said after she turned and glanced at Eisbeth. \u201c We \u2019 re ready to go in. Do you have a location for us? \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s easier if I just mark it, \u201d she said, gesturing at the big screen on the wall. \u201c There are a number of checkpoints and hidden entrances that you \u2019 ll need to cover. \u201d \n \n \u201c Please, \u201d the general said, waving her arm at a console next to her. \n \n Eisbeth leaned over the console, expertly manipulating the controls. The map on the big screen shifted, and zoomed in to encompass a smaller area. Icons began lighting on it; just under half of the actual entrances and checkpoints that guarded the rebels \u2019 secured areas. She finally straightened and looked at the general. \u201c Be prepared for heavy resistance. But if you move quickly, I think you should be able to take them by surprise. Before they realize they \u2019 re unprepared. \u201d \n \n \u201c I have units standing by now. We \u2019 ll break that cell, and that \u2019 ll end the resistance in this entire sector. Good work Major. \u201d \n \n Eisbeth nodded and saluted. \u201c I \u2019 d better get back, before they suspect I \u2019 ve left. \u201d \n \n The general nodded, turning to one of her aides. Eisbeth left the command center and walked around the corner. Once out of sight, she closed her eyes again. This time she opened them to a fire strewn landscape filled with wind swept wailing, bloody rocks, and open pits filled with shattered corpses. A trio of heavy winged demons stood looking into a roaring bonfire being stoked by a dozen enslaved souls; studying the images suspended in the flames. \n \n \u201c Valoc. \u201d \n \n All three demons turned, and they smiled. \u201c Eisbeth. Is it ready? \u201d \n \n \u201c It is. The resistance should become open war within the hour. \u201d Her clothing had vanished, leaving only tightly folded leathery wings, ebony scales, and horns that had been carved with dozens of mystical symbols. She walked toward them, her hooved feet crunching across the bones of countless prior fallen mortals. \n \n \u201c Yes, \u201d the shortest of the demons said, clenching his clawed fingers into a fist the size of a good sized dog. \u201c Thousands of fresh souls to feed the forges. \u201d \n \n \u201c And the Heavenly Hosts won \u2019 t know what hit them when we bring that power to bear upon then. Finally the stalemate will be shattered, \u201d the second demon said, grinning toothily. \n \n \u201c Thank you Eisbeth. \u201d \n \n \u201c Hail Satan, \u201d she said bowing low. \n \n \u201c Leave us. Your task is complete. \u201d \n \n She nodded, and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she looked around at the vast expanse of white she now floated amid. Her heavy demonic form had softened to the gentler, less aggressive lines of a seraphim. Unfolding her wings, now feathered, she flew over to a particularly large cloud, and entered it. \n \n \u201c Hope, welcome, \u201d a melodic male voice said as she passed through the cloud wall. \n \n \u201c Gabriel, it is done, \u201d she said, alighting next to the cluster of angels. \u201c They think the human conflict will grant them the power they need to break your defenses. But you must wait, giving them time to position themselves thinking there will be an advantage to seize. If you strike too soon, it will only lengthen the stalemate. \u201d \n \n Gabriel nodded, fingering the hilt of the sword hanging from his belt. \u201c We will wait. But when they think themselves inviolate, the Host will end this war once and for all. \u201d \n \n \u201c Then my part is done, \u201d she said, bowing. \n \n \u201c Take your ease. You have done well. \u201d \n \n She smiled and floated out of the cloud, leaving the angelic war council to make their final plans. When she was outside in the sky, she teleported home and assumed her true form. \n \n \u201c Honey, is that you? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, \u201d she called, stretching her arms over her head. Here, in her own space, she didn \u2019 t have to posture and could assume the form she preferred. Which was a simple human woman, with comfortable casual clothes. \n \n \u201c Dinner \u2019 s almost ready. How was your day? \u201d \n \n \u201c Pretty good, \u201d Eisbeth said, padding barefoot toward the kitchen and the delicious smells emanating from it. \n \n \u201c You seem happy, \u201d James said, turning as she rounded the corner. Her husband, a mortal she was foolishly fond of, was just setting a tray of lasagna on the counter, fresh from the oven. \n \n \u201c I had a *very* good day, \u201d she said, stepping close enough to slip her arms around his shoulders. His went around her waist. She smiled as pressed herself against him, enjoying the contact. Simple pleasures were often the best, she \u2019 d found. \n \n \u201c How good? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, let \u2019 s just say the power off this should see you and me safely through the end of the century. \u201d She could already feel all that building confidence, all that expectation of victory and success from the misled combatants, flooding into her. And the best was yet to come. Power and then some, more than enough for her purposes. \u201c At least. Come on, let \u2019 s eat. That smells amazing. \u201d \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Humanity is about to engage in their first space battle ever .\n","story":"``... For years mankind fought nature to leave the Earth. Now they fight to return.'' \n \n \n \n \n The intercom buzzed and went silent. Second Lieutenant MacDow layed on his bunk, rotating a coin between his fingers. NASA had known about the worm hole just beyond Mars. The ship named Cosmos, after the Carl Sagan series, had just passed the red planet when they floated into it. But after that all contact was lost; now they were on their way to the Wormhole, which they should be arriving at withing the next week. The intercom buzzed again, MacDow sat up and went to his pod door, still fidgeting with the coin. `` Hello?'' He said, pressing his finger to the green button by the door. \n \n `` Sir, it's Warrant Officer Benal. Captain Zuluaga would like you at the bridge.'' \n \n `` Thank you, Warrant.'' \n \n Grabbing his cover and putting the quarter in his pocket he left for the bridge, marching at as reasonable pace he could in the odd simulated gravity. \n \n _ \n \n \n \n He came to the large reinforced door labeled `` B-1'' which led to the command deck of the bridge. He entered the reasonably sized room and halted, saluting as he did. `` Sir, Second Lieutenant MacDow, reporting.'' The captain returning the salute spoke in a broken, and barely audible voice. \n \n `` Lieutenant, something has exited the wormhole. You were brought on board as a communications expert.'' The Captain stopped. \n \n `` Is it the Cosmos?'' MacDow asked, both shocked and hopeful. \n \n `` We do n't know, that is where you come in. We need to open comms and figure out who the hell this is. We hardly understand the mechanics of how this wormhole works, let alone where our people are.'' The captain sat in a chair by the command module. You have three days before we are passed them, and we can not easily turn a ship this size around to catch up if they are n't friendly. You may use this station and any available resources to talk to them.'' \n \n `` Sir.'' MacDow gave an affirming nod and saluted as the Captain left. He began his work beginning with the simplest communications the ship had. Morse, on an AM frequency. \n \n \n _ \n \n \n It had been two days and nothing so far had worked. MacDow had even tried broadcasting using electromagnetic pulses in an ASCII coding. He placed his hands in his head when the ship rocked. He stood up as alarms began blaring. He pulled up the asteroid map and scanned it for any strays that could have hit. Nothing. Another shudder of the ship keeled him over. The external comms suddenly flared up, he opened the channel to all of command and decoded the message being sent as quickly as he could. It was a complex substitution cypher done over an FM broadcast of some kind. He guessed the key was Cosmos as the way the broadcast came in was secure. It worked. The computer blurted out part of the unscrambled message. `` *Turn back, it*-'' the broadcast cut out as the power shut down on the bridge. \n \n __ \n \n \n The window covers open revealing mars, eclipsed by the hole into which the ship was plummeting. This was all wrong though; the hole was too close. Something was wrong. The ship fell into the hole and out the other side. 2Lt MacDow looked out in awe and horror; the craft had gone through the hole and appeared to a massive star in front of them, the sillouette of massive ships, a crumbling husk of a planet, and the dormant remains of the Cosmos. There was no way to track where they were, or call for help, they had to turn around. Humanity depended on it.\n"}

A drizzling rain forms a clouded film over a busy-city street. Some college students can be seen levitating under their umbrellas in the horizon. Others can be seen either casually hovering down the sidewalks or running hurriedly. One boy covers a girl in a big thin bubble, shielding her from the rain. Cars leave behind fluorescent trails of their headlights as they whip by with towering buildings stretching into the expanse. At an intersection, water patters beneath cars as their tires come to a gradual halt. \n \n On the corner of an intersection lies a man slouching over on his side, face slightly obscured by the hood of his brown-and-black checkered, loose-fitting sweatshirt. He dangles a hand over his face as he shivers violently from the cold. He snaps his fingers, emitting a small spark. Nothing comes of it. \n \n \u201c Ha. Figures. \u201d \n \n In this world where memories fuel magic, there are a lot of these people scattered throughout the city; vagabonds, they call them. The only thing they can recall is their name, and that \u2019 s if they \u2019 re lucky. \n \n The man coils into a fetus position. \u201c Doo, doo.

Doo-doo-doo\u2014, \u201d he grunts, sinking the same finger onto the sidewalk. \n \n On the floor beside him stands a foam cup. One of his hands lazily falls somewhere near the cup while his fingers trace the cement floor back and forth. His tattered blue jeans are damp from the rain. The sea of people surrounding the man make no efforts at acknowledging his existence, not that he even cares. He continues to be flustered over the tune he \u2019 s humming. \n \n At the other end of the street, a young slender boy of college age claps his heels, bending slightly forward while covering the floor beneath him in a trail of ice. He sports black low-top sneakers, a black bubble jacket, a white-and-black striped scarf, and some faded blue jeans. The boy \u2019 s emerald-green eyes beamed outward from beneath his brown, shaggy hair. He glides atop the trail, scarf blowing in the wind. \n \n He arrives at the corner of the intersection in record time, but not before slamming face first into the pillar of a building. \n \n \u201c Oof, I really have to get better at that. \u201d \n \n He gets up, brushing the fall off. For a second, he catches a figure on the floor of the sidewalk. His eyes glaze over the figure of the frail homeless man, still coiled into a fetus position while humming. \n \n The boy looks side-to-side at the people surrounding them, but no one looks back. \n \n He hesitates for a second, just before reaching out into his backpack to pull out a notebook. He sets it right beside the homeless man \u2019 s body. \n \n The boy snaps his fingers, releasing a lively fire from the tips. He carefully extends the fire to the edge of the notebook until it \u2019 s swallowed by the flames. The man stops humming, looking up at the fire when suddenly, their eyes meet. \n \n From within the man \u2019 s weathered and sunken face, a pair of green-emerald eyes pierced through. \n \n Immediately, a sharp pang is felt within the boy \u2019 s chest. He clutches his chest, feeling the moisture at the corner of his eyes gathering, but he can \u2019 t fathom as to why. \n \n And for a while, no one talked. They sat there, wide-eyed and fixed onto each other \u2019 s gaze. \n \n Then, the man hesitantly extended a finger, tracing the contour of the boy \u2019 s face and proceeding to hum; hum a tune he had once forgotten. \n\n"}

At least, not since my dad walked out on my mom thirty years ago. I still remember that year in perfect clarity. The screaming and fighting that took place as I huddled under the covers, praying that they would stop and we would be a happy family like all the others on the block. Then, just days before Christmas Eve, my own mother gently nudging me towards the fat man perched on his golden throne, surrounded by presents and the pimply teenagers dressed as elves who took up part-time jobs as his helpers. I can still remember climbing timidly onto his lap and being asked, \u201c And what do you want for Christmas, little girl? \u201d \n \n And I looked up at him, with his big smiling blue eyes, and whimpered, \u201c I want my mom and dad to stop fighting. It scares me. \u201d Then seeing his big blue eyes take on a look that I couldn \u2019 t quite comprehend until years later, a frown forming beneath his bushy white beard before patting me on the back. \u201c Everything is going to be alright, \u201d he said before one of the teenaged elves hoisted me off his lap and pushed me towards the exit. Only Santa lied to my younger self. Everything didn \u2019 t go alright. Mom and Dad got into a massive fight on Christmas Eve. By the following morning, he had packed up a suitcase and left. \n \n I never saw him again. \n \n I stared up at the ceiling, only bothering to look over at my side to see Jessica sitting up and biting her lower lip. \u201c I \u2019 m sorry\u2026 I\u2026 I should have remembered that this time of year isn \u2019 t easy for you, \u201d she babbled. \n \n \n I shook my head. \u201c It \u2019 s alright\u2026 I \u2019 m over\u2026 \u201d \n \n My words were drowned out by a loud squeal coming from the den downstairs. \n \n \u201c Sarah? \u201d We both shouted in unison. We scrambled out of bed, me still in my nightgown and Jess yanking on a robe over her sports bra and boxer shorts, tying the cord around her waist. We sprinted down the stairs together and stumbled into the den, scared of what we might find waiting in the room with our little girl. \n \n Instead, we found Sarah, standing before the Christmas tree with the biggest, happiest grin on her face we \u2019 ve seen since we adopted her three years ago. \n \n Then she ran to us and wrapped her tiny arms around our legs. \u201c Thank you, \u201d she shrieked. \u201c Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! \u201d \n \n I patted Sarah \u2019 s head and Jess gave her a kiss on the brow before we looked up. \n \n What we saw standing amidst the mountains of wrapped presents in cheery wrapping paper was a goddamn pony. \n \n ______ \n \n \u201c What the shit, Jessica? A pony? \u201d I shouted, slamming my fist down the table. \n \n Jessica \u2019 s hands flew up in a defensive stance. \u201c Me? I thought you bought the pony? \u201d she shouted. \n \n \u201c How can I afford a pony on my teaching salary, \u201d I retorted. This was true. High school science teachers were paid in peanuts. And Jess \u2019 s salary as a personal trainer wasn \u2019 t any better. I slunk further deeper into my chair, gripping my hair in my hands. \u201c Shit, what are we going to do? \u201d \n \n \u201c Where are we going to put it? A condo \u2019 s no place for a pony, \u201d Jess sighed. We looked out the bay window of the dining room to see Sarah standing on our front lawn, brushing the pony \u2019 s blonde mane with her hairbrush and feeding it a carrot. \u201c I don \u2019 t want to disappoint her by telling her we can \u2019 t keep it. Not on Christmas Day. \u201d \n \n \u201c Me neither, \u201d I muttered. Just because the holiday season was ruined for me as a kid didn \u2019 t mean I wanted Sarah to endure the same ordeal. She had been babbling about how much she wanted a pony, ever since one of her preschool classmates had her birthday party at a horse riding ranch the previous summer. Her brain had been firmly planted in Equestri-mania for the last six months. When we took her to see a mall Santa the week before, she told him how she wanted her very own pony. \n \n \u201c Do you know anyone with a stable? \u201d I asked. \u201c Maybe an uncle or someone can take it in until we figure out what to do?'' \n \n Jess shook her head. \u201c My family disowned me after I came out. Remember? \u201d \n \n I let out a sigh. \u201c Okay, maybe I can look up local stables. Someone in the tri-county area is bound to help us out. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah. Let me get my laptop and see what we do about that. \u201d Jess nodded towards the window. Sarah was now braiding the pony \u2019 s mane. \n \n I got out my laptop and began looking through stables in the area. Jess also logged onto her laptop. After an hour of searching, broken up periodically to check up on Sarah and the pony she had now christened \u201c Princess \u201d, Jess waved me over. \n \n \u201c You will not believe what I found, \u201d she said, her eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. \n \n I peered over her shoulder and what I saw on the front page of the forum Jess liked to visit when she wanted to goof around made me gasp. \n \n There were pages upon pages of posts, photographs, and video uploaded by parents around the world, shocked that they woke up on Christmas morning to find presents under the tree that they claimed they never bought for their children. There were grinning kids and bewildered moms and dads posing with ponies like Princess, toy robots, expensive Lego sets and Barbie Dream Houses, guns both real and fake. Some kid in Australia wanted uranium and got a tin of the real deal! There were news articles of family members and random children turning up dead. More of other parents, deployed at military bases and warzones oceans away, suddenly showing up on doorsteps and driveways Christmas morning looking just as confused while their children ran up to them with arms wide open. Couples who had split up were suddenly reunited. \n \n \u201c What the everloving\u2026 \u201d Jess mouthed over my phone \u2019 s marimba ringtone. I glanced down at the phone, which was vibrating on the table. I picked it up with trembling hands and noticed that I had a incoming call from my mom. \n \n I pressed the call button. \u201c Uh\u2026 hi, Mom, \u201d I said in a shaking voice. \u201c Merry\u2026 \u201d \n \n \u201c Annie, you will not believe what just happened, \u201d Mom interrupted, her voice sounding ever so clear and close despite being a thousand miles away. \u201c But the strangest thing happened this morning. \u201d \n \n \u201c What is it? \u201d \n \n \u201c Your dad\u2026 he\u2026 he came back. He\u2026 he says he \u2019 s changed. Went to rehab and got clean. Been so for fifteen years. He wants to try and make this work out again. \u201d \n \n I glanced over at Jess, who was now staring at me with wide eyes. \n \n What the shit was going on? \n \n _____ \n I do n't have a personal subreddit. But I do appreciate feedback. \n\n"}

His thoughts got interrupted with her tender slow kiss on the back of his neck and on his cheek as she smiled and prepared breakfast for the kids. There he is I thought to myself, my job for the day, there's his family and here's everything that he has and everything that he wakes up to every morning. \n \n Proud as he was from what happened from the meeting and how managed to get in the new clients for the company as that was the big foot in the door he desperately needed with his new boss he went out for drinks in the hotel bar with his co-workers and Aurelia. Before I knew it while I was sunk in my thoughts about Emelia, how she always tugged his tie to spend half a minute with him for one last kiss. Suddenly, I looked up and I here it was, Aurelia in the hallway with her black tight dress exposing her shoulders and neck with him standing in-front of her. He was a loyal old-fashioned man, but I knew what should be done as I whispered in his ear to steal the quickest glance of her bare smooth neck and shoulders as he was exchanging some small senseless tipsy talk about the bar setting and there it was Aurelia with her desire for him as she started rhythmically breathing harder for him to fill her emotional void and her attention need for him. He started slowing down the pace and slurring the words as he looked in her eyes and read that the desire being thrown at him, I slowly stood behind him and I knew I could n't use any of my cliches with him, but rather highlight how her shoulders and neck changed their size and shape whenever she took a breath for him and I whirled him in the simple fantasy of her sweet scent on his mouth and lips in the room behind the door she was leaning on. They both went silent and he stared for what seemed like forever even to me, as I saw him still and not backing away when she approached his face with hers, I knew I no longer did n't need to be there. \n \n I never wanted to see Emelia like this, she was his home for 5 years. There she was back at her sister's apartment on the ground alone, silently shivering and tearing up on how her life would never be the same after what he did, I watched as I repeated in my head `` it was his choice it was his choice it was his choice''. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You awaken to find most of your body has been replaced with prosthetic parts . As you adjust , you notice something wrong .\n","story":"**Kind of NSFW* \n Bright lights bore down upon me, unable to stand them I squinted my eyes tightly, trying to get a view of my immediate surroundings. \n \n `` Where am I'' I called out, remembering only a sliver of last night, I felt something immediately wrong as I realized that the creaking sound coming from underneath me was not my bed, but rather my arm. \n \n At first is appeared as a think grey line crossing just over my elbow, upon closer inspection I realized that it split my forearm from my shoulder. \n \n Falling out of the iron bed I had been placed on the horror of my situation was finally revealed. Small metal nails stuck out from every joint and each limb looked barely attached. What was even weirder, was that I was able to *move* them. Somehow finding the will to stand, I stood shakily, gripping the bed to keep myself stable. Bring the seemingly prosthetic hand close to my face I could see each individual finger as I clenched them into a fist and back again. \n \n Only when I realized that I was naked did something strike fear deep into my heart, looking down I realized that I was lacking a very important *member* of my body. \n \n *Please no* I whispered to myself, an odd mechanical tone aiding my natural voice. Reaching my hand down below I noticed a small hatch implanted in the center, reaching my finger inside I found a switch. Hesitantly flicking it up I could feel something growing. \n \n A metallic rod slid out silently from its holding, like a snake ready to strike. I let out a sigh of relief, releasing the switch. \n \n The rod had other ideas however, \n \n It just kept extending, and extending, and extending.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Your daughter asks you to check and see if there 's a monster under her bed ... This time there actually is a monster .\n","story":"My daughter is a creative little bugger, no doubt about it. She gets it from her mom, definitely not me. Her room is filled with pages from her favorite coloring books, and her pre-school art projects. She loves her cartoons, and that's where a majority of my bonding time with her comes on. We both love watching cartoons. Anything funny, anything sad, we both share the same favorite shows, which is a rarity for a father and daughter. \n \n One night before we went to bed, we decided to watch Pokemon: The First Movie on television. One of my favorites, as its something I grew up with and know plenty about. She loves listening to my long-winded explanations, which is great, because my wife does n't. Now, I've never looked at that movie as a horror film before, but in the eyes of a 4 year old little girl, Mewtwo is horrifying. She shifted uncomfortably through the whole movie, and cried her little eyes out when Ash was turned to stone. She spent most of the movie with her face buried in my chest, but when I offered to change it, she would n't let me. `` No, daddy, I'm having fun, its just scaaaary.'' I knew from that point that getting her to bed that night would n't be fun. \n \n `` Daddy! Come quick!'' There was plenty of alarm in her voice. `` I think I hear something under my bed!'' I rush into the room, knowing that she's probably still a bit frightened from the movie. \n \n `` Everything will be fine, I'm sure there's nothing there.'' I reach under the bed and reach around, searching for anything under the bed that might be making a noise to frighten her, when suddenly I find a jacket. She stifles a giggle, but not quite well enough, because I notice. `` What're you laughing at?'' \n \n `` Daddy, look in the pocket!'' I reach my hand into the old jacket, and pull out a small action figure, of Mew, the Pokemon from the movie. `` Its a Pocket Monster!'' She laughs maniacally and points at me. `` I GOT YOU GOOD!'' She's a genius in her own mind. \n \n `` Goodnight, sweety.'' I kiss her on the forehead and leave her alone to her laughter, and eventual sleep.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A very typical everyday plumber find himself sucked into a portal .\n","story":"`` Captain, Knight Ronalde reporting. I've brought the information as you requested.'' Saluting as the address began, the man who entered the room took up the tense position of one awaiting interrogation, straightening as he began his report. `` Another rift and another entry, this time Southern town Forles, just North of the Redstone territories.'' \n \n `` Alive?'' At the desk, a bespectacled man set down the parchment he'd been eyeing, noble-style reading glasses removed with a rough sigh. `` I'm guessing that's a *no, * is n't it?'' \n \n `` Unfortunately, Captain.'' Still at attention, Ronalde tried not to stare as his superior reached for the flask of amber, taking a hefty sip before standing with a gruff hiss of displeasure. It took little for him to notice that the room smelled strongly of spirits, or the second- much more empty flask sitting unattended on the floor. `` If I may, Sir-'' \n \n `` Fine, take me to it. Gods only know the Queen wo n't want us bringing the corpse in here.'' The Captain retrieved a rough looking contraption of wood and metal from beside the desk, slinging it over his shoulder to match the regal sword at his waist. `` Do you know the cause of death?'' \n \n `` Captain, reports say it was simply a bad landing. No fowl play suspected. The rift opened up thirty feet above the cobblestone... the results were... unpleasant.'' \n \n `` The poor bastard never had a chance.'' \n \n `` No sir. Likely dead on impact.'' \n \n `` Any other disturbances? Ripple effects?'' Objects of interest?'' \n \n `` Sir, some artifacts were recovered. Metal tools of some kind, and another mana-housing.'' Checking the parchment in hand, Ronalde took the lead lead, confirming. `` A small amount of water as well, reportedly. The Church Officials of the town were attempting to take the scene when we arrived, but the Royal crest backed them down.'' \n \n `` Did you recover everything?'' A rough gesture from the Captain signaled a post of armored guards waiting in the hall, an entourage began to form. Knights fell into step with rough clatter of plates and steel as the Captain continued down towards the heavy-set wooden doors. `` I want every object found, in all likelihood we're going to need them at some point.'' \n \n `` For the most part they've been recovered, although it's hard to say. The Church might have hidden some of them.'' Keeping pace, the Soldier fell back as the Captain slammed the doors open, going on ahead as two panicked attendants jumped back from the wide-swing. `` We were n't the first on scene.'' \n \n `` You'd really think the Church might lack the spine for that sort of thing nowadays.'' An angry growl sounded with the faintest hint of liquor as the Captain's pace increased, growing gaggle of Guards struggled to follow without forming to a trot in the hallways. `` After that god-damned bloody Sunday, you'd expect them to consider a bit more before trying anything.'' \n \n `` Aye Sir, you're right Sir! We'd all think it.'' The brisk reply came with a halt of movement, as the Captain zeroed in on the first room in the hall. `` But it's in the realm of possibilities, so-'' \n \n `` Hold on a moment- ROB!'' The Captain's shout echoed through the rafters as he knocked loudly on the smaller set of doors. `` Rob, get up!'' The knocking continued, relentlessly. `` I need you to lead a team, ASAP. If I have to come back here with a bucket of ice water, so help me god- I'll do it!'' \n \n *'' It's late! * A muffled voice replied, obviously irritated. *'' You had me running Body-guard for the Queen with that damn Elf of yours all day! Joe has the other set of keys, make him go! `` * \n \n `` Rob, if the ice water does n't do it for you I'll go down the hall and get Sandra to open the door.'' \n \n *'' You would n't! `` * \n \n `` I might...'' The Captain let his tone settle for a moment, considering. `` Rob, I though Adventuring was your deal. Was n't that the reason you came here?'' \n \n *'' Oh... for fuck's sake, I'm coming! Do n't you dare sick that crazy Mage-woman on me. `` * a rough shuffle and the clatter of wood sounded before the door was opened to reveal a bedraggled man of slightly plump build. `` From threats to guilt-tripping, I see how you do things.'' \n \n `` I would n't if I could help it, but I've got a Mission for you.'' The Captain eyed the man, almost uneasy. `` Twenty miles south, urgent: I'd recommend taking the Jeep.'' \n \n `` *Another* mission, Captain?'' \n \n `` Quest than, if that sounds better to you.'' The Captain peeked past the door with a grimace at the unorganized mess within the room. `` It's a retrieval. A portal opened to the South.'' \n \n `` Hooo, anything interesting come out of them?'' \n \n `` One person, now deceased.'' \n \n `` Nothing else?'' \n \n `` No, but where there's one, there's a good chance of more. Queen's scouts have reported as much, we saw that happen last month too with what might have been an aircraft.'' The Captain pulled the parchment from Ronadle's waiting hand beside him, scanning it over before giving a gruff nod. `` *Poor bastard might have been a plumber*... Listen, I want you down there with a team. Any more people come out, bring them here if you can.'' \n \n `` If this is a longterm thing I'm requesting Eron. Guns are great an all, but I'm not going back out there without some solid firepower.'' From the doorway, the man's arms crossed over a stained t-shirt and a slight beer-gut. `` I want a mage.'' \n \n `` Fine, and I'll throw in six knights while you're at it- but if you get Eron, you get Sandra.'' \n \n `` Sandra-'' The man choked on the name, coughing with a flustered anger. `` Since when was that a rule?'' \n \n `` Since they put rings on each other's fingers.'' \n \n `` Oh for fuck's sake- Fine then! But I want Joe too.'' Puffing up, the man eyed the Captain. `` My car, my rules. I'm not going anywhere with Sandra unless Joe is there to watch my back. I do n't want to wind up dead.'' \n \n `` No Rob, I ca n't do it.'' The Captain dismissed the suggestion, `` I might need Joe if another Portal opens somewhere else. If not him, then I'll likely need to leave the Capital myself, and there's a still a Church mark on my neck. That's a disaster waiting to happen.'' \n \n `` Then you can send your Crazy Elf, or the Werewolf- I want Joe on my team.'' \n \n `` We both know that Queen Aurum's very fond of that werewolf,'' The Captain let a sly smile creep over his beard, `` and the *Crazy* Elf wo n't leave even if I order her to.'' \n \n `` Seriously?'' \n \n `` I'm afraid so.'' \n \n `` You're not budging?'' \n \n `` No, I ca n't give you all of them Rob, I'm sorry.'' The Captain confirmed, `` There have been too many assassination attempts recently anyways, at least one of them is needed here for now.'' \n \n `` Fine, keep the Mages, just send me with Joe- and knock that down to four knights so we can fit without that shit trailer you've got. We'll get it done.'' \n \n `` Deal.'' \n \n -- -- \n \n \n **This story is a continuation of a bunch of other writing-prompts! ** \n \n [ Start here! ] ( https: \/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WritingPrompts\/comments\/51f8ag\/wp_youre_such_a_powerful_magician_that_life_is\/d7bn3g2\/ ) \n \n [ Previous ] ( https: \/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WritingPrompts\/comments\/612yh9\/tt_every_neighborhood_in_your_city_has_a_resident\/dfbd58i\/ ) \n \n [ Next ] ( https: \/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WritingPrompts\/comments\/638e3v\/wp_write_a_story_that_ends_with_and_yet_my_desire\/dfs90ri\/ ) \n\n"}

I definitely do not sound that high-pitched. `` Hi, I'm calling because I want to abuse your product line and make a mockery of your company? Yes. That's correct. Yes, I'm doing it purely because I think I'm smarter than everyone else- huh,'' he says, turning to me. `` Seems like they hung up.'' \n \n I grit my teeth. \n \n `` Marvin, could you kindly repeat what I'm about to say to the genie?'I wish for one million dollars, to be given immediately and safely to the human nearest to me.''' \n \n `` Poof! *Finally*'', says the genie, and presents me with a large stack of bills. `` That's better. Less of this too-cool-for-school stuff, more giving into your greed and baser qualities. One for you, three for the lad.'' \n \n I did n't want to think about his comment about greed too much. \n \n `` Well,'' I say. `` I think I've won.Marvin, say'I wish for someone who is eligible for six wishes and has n't used any of those wishes yet who is willing to wish for whatever I ask them.'' \n \n Marvin obliges. \n \n `` You're getting pretty creepy,'' commented the genie. `` Unfortunately, there are no valid people like that.'' \n \n `` What?'' I ask. \n \n `` Since you pulled that stunt with poor Marvin here, the rules were quickly revised. As long as anyone has wishes left, nobody else is eligible for wishes. One for you, two for him.'' \n \n `` But you did n't grant the wish!'' \n \n `` We at GenieCorp endeavor to do our best to provide top-notch wish service. However, in the event that a wish is impossible to grant, we do not have a refund policy.'' \n \n `` Outrageous,'' I mutter. `` Marvin, say to the genie'I wish that the human closest to me had complete jurisdiction over GenieCorp policy.'' \n \n Marvin dutifully repeats the phrase. \n \n `` Sorry! The wish hardware makes meddling with anything in its own internal working via wish impossible.'' \n \n `` But that does n't even make sense!'' \n \n `` One wish left for each of you.'' \n \n `` All right,'' I say. `` Two left. Might as well make sure I get something more than money out of this before trying to cheat the system again. Marvin, tell the genie'I wish that Lita from the human nearest to me's chemistry class liked him.' Also, take this.'' \n \n I hand him half of the million dollars, in a vain attempt to assuage my conscience. \n \n `` Wow,'' said the genie. `` I feel like there's a lesson to be learned from this. Something about mankind's weaknesses. Or maybe about not trusting it to people who do n't even have their fly up.'' \n \n I glance down, and hastily zip it up. \n \n `` Well?'' I demand. \n \n `` Poof!'' the genie says. `` She did indeed like you, but she's over that now. One wish left.'' \n \n `` THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AND YOU KNOW IT!'' \n \n `` You should thank me,'' said the genie. `` Or, maybe, the rest of humanity should.'' \n \n I reach into my pocket and withdraw my phone. \n \n `` What are you doing now?'' \n \n I glare at the genie. `` Time to put this half a million to use. I need to have a request without loopholes. I'm calling a lawyer.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Fit as many plot twists as you can into one story .\n","story":"ANNOUNCER \n \n Today, like any other day, we have a submission from a person who wants the Trump team to weigh in on a certain topic. We've been doing this show for 3 weeks and I still ca n't get used to live broadcasts. Is it camera one? Are we even rolling? We ca n't do things like this when he's president, folks. We need to get our asses in gear. \n \n ( Camera changes to camera one ) \n \n Alright, it looks like we're live on air for Trump TV this afternoon. We'll be looking at a certain prompt from a user of the Writing Prompts subreddit. The prompt reads thus: \n \n ( Announcer reads the prompt ) \n \n It sort of reminds you of a Christopher Nolan movie, does n't it? The director who floored a generation and made the word inception synonymous with mindfuck. On that note, I've heard of this prompt before in online mags. It seems its not a radical idea to pack a story chock full of as many twists as possible. For example, we found this story online that attempts to accomplish that exact thing. \n \n ( provide link to the story ) \n \n For us, though, the concept is very new. We have our greatest minds on the team thinking now about how they might handle this situation. They've considered using cliche plot twists to signal each new twist, such as a pregnancy surprise or a double-handed backstabbing motive for the character. On the other hand, the twists could be more subtle or singular. There could be a few greater, more interesting twists as well. \n \n ( Begin Trump close-up ) \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n Audience, I have a scene-stealing idea for a plot twist. Imagine this. You're walking in your hotel when you see the sign change, from Trump Tower, it's in the front of the building, so you would notice the change, by the way, to Clinton Mill. Astounding, right? But I suppose the prompt does call for more than one twist. Say the Clinton Mill is full of robots, or something. Then you find out it's all the politicians, the scoundrels, who are the robots. And get this, they've been robots all along! And you're going to be recruited to join their rhyming robot army to change the face of the nation. We could call the broadcast something like Zombie Television. That's all there is in the future anyway, is Zombie TV. Mindless advertising commercials and stories. And then it hits you... You're a zombie. That's a twist right there. I'd hate to find out I was a zombie. Trust me, I would kill myself a second time, if it were possible. I would n't want to be a walking corpse at all. And you know some people have this delusion, the Cotard delusion, I think its called, where they think they're already dead. To me, that sounds terrible. Youve really got it bad if you think you're dead already. The twist is in there, it's great, check it out, we'l have it written in 3 hours. \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n Thank you Mr. President. Your input is of course highly regarded. Will there be any action in the coming script? \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n Lots of action, terrifying action, and it will take everyone by surprise. \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n What is the general direction the plot is taking so far, Mr. Trump? \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n We're looking at taking two secret service agents through a CIA refuge in Afghanistan. They will meet some kind of mystery woman who will deliver all the twists. First, she's a hobo. Then, she's a billionaire. She orders a helicopter and tells the people she's already killed Osama Bin Ladin. Then, she reveals she's Hillary Clinton in digsuise. The secret agents turn on each other, one having voted for Clinton and the other voting for me. The one who voted for Clinton is majorly fat and falls out of the helicopter. Then, the second agent kills Hillary. It will sell millions. I absolutely can not wait. \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n But why Afghanistan, if I may ask? \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n Because that's where the war started. It's topical. It's in the current frame of mind. \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n We are n't planning a war in Afghanistan, are we? Not another one! \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n No, were sending Hillary there dressed as a hobo in disguise. Why are n't you paying attention? \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n I didnt realize the prompt was actually going to happen. I suppose I thought we were just writing stories. \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n Life imitates art. We're going to flesh it out as a story first, and see if it pans out the way we planned. You know life is but a stage, and we actors upon it. It's a narrative people are after, something they can digest and understand. We want people to be aware, comfortable they know what's going on. \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n Even entertained? \n \n DONALD J TRUMP \n \n My presidency wo n't be a reality show, guy. But, I suppos that it may be entertaining. \n \n ANNOUNCER \n \n And all of the viewers of Trump TV will be tuning in every week for that kind of story. You'll hear it here first. If you do n't hear it here, it's not happening. We're the ultimate all-action news channel. Thanks for tuning in. That's all the time we have for today. \n \n ( cut ) \n\n"}

But the dark lord 's power is so far beyond what anyone had expected ...\n","story":"The woods smelled of blood and ash. The trees were dead and naked. The branches sprouted out towards the sky, like if they were pleading the heavens to reach down and pluck them from this horrible place. The red and orange leaves that had belonged to the trees covered the ground, and piling up over the years. They reached the group's knees. \n \n Ralam, the farmer turned warrior, and his brave allies decided to camp for the night. The skies overhead were black, flashing every now and then with furious lightning, briefly lighting up their surroundings as if nature was telling them not to even bother with torches. There was a thick fog around them. Thunder bellowed and shook the ground whenever it made itself heard. Masfop, the archer from the east, went looking for dry wood as soon as Ralam chose a spot to for all to camp. Ledsa The Unseen stood watch while Gumash The Mind pretended to check the map that was given to them by a merchant. He was really drawing in his sketchbook. Ralam and Yanklin the Bludgeoner started removing leaves and made a big enough clearing for 5 people and a fire. When Ranklin was done, he threw his sleeping bag on the floor, and went straight to sleep, he was incredibly tired, cracking heads took its toll. Ledsa bore holes in nearby trees and thrust several torches in place. Masfop came back shortly with dry twigs, and as he threw them in the middle of the clearing Ralam and Ranklin made, he chuckled and shook his head. \n \n `` We are surrounded by dry leaves and I went looking for dry wood.'' The tired heroes shared a laugh. As it died down, Ranklin snored loudly and the laughter was revived. The fire was made, and everyone sitting around felt safe. \n \n Nobody stood watch that night. \n \n Morning came, the lightning continued still and the thunder raged on. The fog was still hanging over them, and the sky was still black. 8 hours had past and everyone felt ready. \n \n `` Who had first watch last night?'' Ralam asked, with worry in his voice. \n Everyone looked at each other, Ranklin shrugged, Masfop looked behind him and back to Ralam, `` I do n't think we assigned a watch last night.'' \n `` We have to be more careful than this, we are so close.'' Ralam said, gathering his supplies. \n \n `` This journey has been a hell.'' Gumash sighed. \n Ralam put his hand on Gumash's shoulder. \n `` I know this friend, I am forever grateful to you, to all of you, for joining me.'' \n A moment of silence fell upon them. \n Ledsa smiled, and could n't help but think aloud. `` Do you remember when Hoom lusted over the maid with the heavy breasts and arse? And he wrote her a poem about how when he sees her lovely tits he cheeses his loins and cries with happiness?'' \n Everyone laughed. \n `` He stuttered the whole time he was reciting that piece of shit poem!'' Masfop chimed in, trying to hold back tears of laughter. \n `` His face when the maid spilled ale on his dumb face was the best part. ``, added Ranklin. \n `` He was a good soldier.'' Ralam said. \n \n They killed the fire, and they continued their journey. Ralam took point, Ranklin was behind him, Gumash was behind Ranklin, Ledsa was behind Gumash, and Masfop was behind her. Their destination was not far off. They could tell, because the smell of blood and ash became more prevalent. \n \n They followed the smell for hours, not speaking a word. They were alert, beads of sweat ran down their face. No weapon was ever gripped tighter. The party gasped, as the air suddenly turned colder. Suddenly there was a screech, and their torches exploded, splinters and ash flew everywhere. \n \n Masfop was n't holding a torch, and pulled on the bowstring, ready to shoot any sorry figure that made itself seen to him. The lightning lit up the woods, and he could see several humanoid figures in the distance, moving towards them. They were taller than any human he had ever seen, thin with long arms. He shot as many as he could before it became dark again. Thunder shook the ground. \n \n The others stopped rubbing their eyes and put their backs against each other. \n \n `` Listen to the leaves!'' Ralam shouted.\n"}

I am currently still alive, and I will remain alive until death, and I will die on my last day of being alive. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rather than let others do it, I chose to write my autobiography myself. My life has consisted of a series of events, some connected some not, some significant others pointless. I have met people, all of whom were human beings, and some of these people were significant to me while others had no impact on my life whatsoever. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I fell in love once to a female girl that I loved. She had hair, and eyes, and an epidermis. The girl also had a vagina. At the time of our first encounter at a place in space, she was alive. She breathed using lungs and pumped blood through her body thanks to a heart. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Our marriage was exactly one year before our first anniversary and one day before our only honeymoon. We had sex, which, as it turns out, is how babies are made. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; When our baby was born ( our son was a boy, btw ), we were happy. As he grew older, he changed from a baby to a toddler to a child to a youth to an adult. Even though half of him is like me, the other half is like his mother. There can only be two halves in a whole, a person might have once said at one time or another. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He joined the army, which is a branch of the military. One day, overseas across the sea, he once died. His first time dying would also be his last. We buried him in the ground, under some dirt. The death of our son made us feel sad. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; My only wife, who was also the only mother of my only son, stopped speaking to everyone ( and anyone! ). Most mornings she rocked in her rocking chair, this chair made to rock back and forth. Right around sunrise, the sun would rise in the morning. She would watch it with her eyes. She did this for 730 sunrises across two years, and then she died until she was dead. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Now that I am by myself, I am alone. Sometimes I visit her grave, which is located at the bottom of a gravestone in a graveyard. The gravestone has her name on it along with her birthday and the day she died. If you subtract the first year from the second one, you can figure out her age, but only up to a certain date. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I usually sit in the rocking chair now, but if you find that its empty, that means I am not sitting in it. As long as I am alive, I am not dead, and if I am not dead, I am alive. Life has been good. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Obviously.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You have been shot through space in a cryogenic freeze . You finally unfreeze and find that you are a museum artifact on an alien planet .\n","story":"Disorientation and nausea were what awaited me when I first awoke. My eyelashes still held some frost on them, the rest of my body felt like I'd fallen asleep in an ice-bath. Every part of my body was a cold fire for a few moments before the pod around me slowly came to life. \n \n `` Greetings, Survivor. You have been asleep for-'' The feminine voice in my ear skipped with a scramble of white noise before continuing, `` Your emergency pickup beacon has been activated. Please hold while your internals are analyzed and repaired as necessary.'' \n \n A soft hum fills my chilled confines as things begin to gradually warmup. The first parts of me to feel any real warmth are my fingers and toes, followed slowly by the rest of my body, a dull ache still present in my lower abdomen. I croak as I open my mouth, my voice almost completely shot after who knows how many years of lack of use. Barely a second passes after I open my mouth before a matte grey rod extends from next to my head and inserts a straw in my mouth. My eyes open wide a little in shock as the straw forces its way into my throat, the liquid it forces me to swallow almost feeling like my body is on fire for a few seconds. \n \n Vision blurring for a moment, I finally feel the strength to move my head. The compartment is dimly lit by the various status indicators and monitors present in my escape pod. My body is tightly held in place by various straps, preventing me from being injured by too much movement while asleep. \n \n `` Defrost process... 85 % complete. Your Kidneys, Liver, and a toe are in need of repair. Please remain relaxed, Survivor.'' A needle enters the base of my neck and within seconds my visions blackens again. \n \n When my eyes open again, I'm far more aware of my surroundings, the monitors actually making sense versus their earlier state of simply providing light. The first thing to catch my eye was a monitor with a blinking orange warning message, clearly stating,'Location Unknown: Please Remain Calm.' \n \n The escape pod's computer continued on with her uncaring calmness, `` Procedure successful. Survival chances increased to 2 %. Status update: Contact with HFN Ignitor... No Signal Found. Contact with Human Federation Navy... No Signal Found. Contact with known Human settlements... No Signal Found. Contact with any known method of transmission... Multiple transmissions within 100 Meters located.'' \n \n The vitals monitor to the left of my head was fluctuating wildly. Small red text at the bottom clearly stated,'Caution: Forced Calmness being administered.' The words were slowly beginning to fade into the background as the sound of my breathing increased. Despite my attempts at panicking, the chemical cocktail being forcefully injected into me was preventing me from having any form of a natural reaction to the situation. My vision kept flicking across all of the monitors. All of the red and orange warning messages did nothing to help my state of mind, that was until the computer began with the next step of the defrost process. \n \n `` Scanning current location... General location data acquired. Survivor is currently suspended 2 Meters above solid ground. Analyzing solid ground... No data found. Analyzing Atmospheric content: Air similar to Earth norm. Registered and marked as breathable by Human standards. Gravity registered as point two standards below Earth norm. Analysis Complete: Current location hospitable to Human life. No information on life forms able to be acquired.'' \n \n The lump in the back of my throat lessened... My head was still thick from the emergency induced cryosleep. All I could remember was there being a battle and my getting to an escape pod. As for what happened between then and now... I could n't begin to imagine. Tears began to form in my eyes as the feeling of panick slowly began to fade and all that was left was an utter sense of loneliness. \n \n Clicking back to life once more, the computer spun up into her final part of the defrost process, `` Analysis indicates Survivor able to safely exit pod. Emergency sidearm is registering as functional and fully-loaded. Bio-lock has been locked to Survivor's DNA signature. External camera activated.'' The main monitor, displaying the information received during the various scans, swapped over to the external camera view. All that could be seen was static and a grey message box with white letters,'External Camera damaged. Please contact the Help Desk at 382-5968 for assistance with repairs.' \n \n A hefty sigh filled the air as the bog standard and all-too-familiar message filled my screen. The want to wallow in self-pity was quickly tossed aside as a hiss filled the air, the door to the pod slowly animating. A line of light appeared through the crack that suddenly appeared. A whirring noise was quickly followed by a dull thud. \n \n `` Automatic pod hatch control damaged. Please manually open hatch.'' Grumbling to myself, some memories beginning to trickle back through my mind, I loose my hand from the slackening bonds and give a hefty whack to the right side of the of pod. My gloved hand barely felt the impact before the computer came back on, `` Automatic pod hatch control restored.'' \n \n This time, the door slid open fully just as I eagerly released myself from the rest of my bonds. The 2 meter fall was n't all that appreciated in my current state, but it served to wake me up. It took me a moment to realize I'd fallen face first onto some kind of metal, something my standard escape pod had n't recognized. The fall also knocked loose some of the defrost liquid I'd had to swallow, the vile green concoction spilling out from my empty stomach onto the metal before I had to chance to look up. \n \n `` Oh my god, what the fuck...'' The words left my lips before I could even process what I was seeing. The ceiling was so tall that I could n't see it, the walls just simply going off into infinity. There were... things moving up there but they were so high up that I could n't make out what they were. Bringing my gaze back down to my level, I finally became aware of the beings surrounding me. Many were holding up silver tubes that were pointed at me, some others were holding little boxes that they held in what I could only assume were menacing gestures. Groggily, I rolled myself over and sat down, breathing heavily, getting used to the thick air that filled my lungs. It almost felt overpowering, but I was still able to breathe. I sat like that for a few minutes, the amount of creatures surrounding me growing by the second. \n \n The grey beings stood on three legs and had four tentacles for arms. Their long faces did n't appear to have any eyes that I'd recognize and they had a horn like protrusion in the bottom of their skulls that jutted out like some gross devil's goatee. Suddenly everything snapped into focus. A mix of a dozen violent emotions crossed my face as I realized that I was alone. A war, violent end to a bloody conflict, that entire system erased from the galaxy as Humanity laid down our law in our explored reaches of space. The last memories of any human contact... A clasp of a hand with a promise to see each other again before getting into individual escape pods. \n \n Putting my head in my hands, I wept. I wept as finally some of the beings took their alien into custody, their tentacles surprisingly strong as they forced me to my feet before dragging me away.\n"}

Tina!'' shouted Dad, leaning back in his chair as though those additional few centimetres were the difference between Mum hearing him or not. I sat nervously opposite him. What had I done this time? The last time they sat me down it was because Mum thought I was watching porn. `` I've noticed'' I can still remember the tremor in her voice `` that our internnet history has been... well... I've noticed that someone has been looking at big breasts on there.'' It still amuses me that she thought it necessary to describe them. \n \n \n \n `` It's'Internet' Mum. One, fluid word. Not Intern-net.'Internet'. And I have n't been looking at breasts on there. I have a laptop for that.'' Mum had tutted and rolled her eyes. Eventually Dad piped up - it had been him all along. He was on the sofa that night, and ever since he'd borrow my laptop a lot more. Hopefully this was n't going to be Round 2 of porn-gate. \n \n \n \n `` Just coming!'' shouted Mum from upstairs. \n \n \n \n `` What's this about?'' I asked Dad, who was irritatingly tapping his fingers on the table. `` Wait for your mother'' he said with a feigned smile. Jesus Christ. \n \n \n \n Mum came in, trailing a long piece of thin paper behind her. It looked like a low budget wedding dress. All it needed was a few napkins from last night's McDonalds as a veil and she'd have the full outfit. \n \n \n \n `` Ah, here she is!'' chirped Dad, doing his best to maintain the unnaturally wide smile he had forced. His face had to be aching. \n \n \n \n `` Here I am! Right, let's get down to business.'' \n \n \n \n `` What business?'' I asked, frowning at the suspiciously cheerful pair. Both of them turned to look at me, almost as though they had momentarily forgotten I was there. `` Well...'' said Mum, her cheery tone giving way to apprehension, `` this business''. She piled the toilet-paper like document in front of me. `` What is it?'' I asked, my eyes fixed firmly on Dad's. He was the weak one, the one I could extract proper information from. And he knew it. His eyes darted around the room, desperate not to meet mine. `` Dad?''

Your bill, from us.'' \n \n \n \n `` Interest free'' interjected Dad, as though he was my saviour. \n \n \n \n `` You mean you're charging me for everything you've bought me? *Everything*?'' \n \n \n \n `` Not everything, dear.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write me a story about taking care of a child that is n't yours .\n","story":"It was Wednesday. I was still feeding canned meat to the child, but I knew that would no longer be viable. I had already gone through every can I had stored in the fallout shelter\u2014and that was meant to be a haven for three hungry people for as long as five years. I had begun buying in bulk at a warehouse store near downtown. \n \n Non-viable, too, because of the heat. By Wednesday water came out of the faucet boiling. It did n't bother me to touch, and the new consistency my skin had slowly taken apparently made it invulnerable to fire. My new skin had the texture of a snake without scales. It fit snug on my unnaturally lengthening bones and, despite the repulsion and nausea I continued to feel when I studied it too closely, gave me an unmistakable sense of power. \n \n This all was undoubtably due to the child. The heat in my apartment, the sickening puberty I was going through, there was no doubt in my mind that this was all because of the child, that sobbing, steaming, red, very red, deep, fiery red thing in the crib, burning the sheets with its shit and spewing sacrilege and obscenities about the Good Lord and His son. All the wallpaper in the room had been scorched off when the child sneezed three days ago. It had grown considerably since then. I foresaw that soon my previous child's crib, my late human son's crib, would collapse. It was some force I did n't understand that kept the wooden thing from bursting into flame days ago. The crib was no longer the crib that held my son. Now it was something that did n't belong here, the source of the unnatural heat. \n \n My nose had receded up almost entirely, leaving me with two long nasal slits below and between my eyes. My hair had burned off almost as soon as the child had been delivered and my scalp, wrists, and belly grew flushed redder every day, though not, I had realized, with blood. \n \n Thursday was a milestone. At half past two, the doorbell rang. Over the speaker came greetings and polite queries and explanations, but I could n't understand the words. It was like trying to interpret the shrieks of children. I was no longer one of them, and the noises he made at me induced pity and rage. I realized this was the effect the child was having on my mind. I buzzed the man in and waited for him to come up to the sixth floor. \n \n My apartment apparently still appeared normal from the hallway. Our visitor gave a solid knock before screaming in pain. I opened the door; the heat from inside pounced out into the corridor, shattering the light bulbs and making the air shudder as if being choked. I looked behind me for a weapon then remembered that with my new hands, a weapon would be redundant. The visitor had flattened himself against the wall, nursing his hand\u2014his knuckles had been burned, skin coming off on the door, exposed knuckle bones still glowing. I knew what I had to do for the child. I would never have done it before, but I was different now. I had no choice. I stepped toward the cowering man. He had already soaked through his shirt with sweat. He was crying. \n \n The child's voice came from all directions. *'' Feed,'' * it cried, shrill and with inhuman depth. The sound made my skull ache. Its first word. \n \n I was proud as a mother can be.\n"}

I knew that his species did n't sleep, but I liked to ask him anyway as a little joke. He did n't know that I knew that he did n't sleep. \n \n His handsome holographic image grinned, but his real face looked worried, as it usually did when he had to lie. Grotfer were n't good at lying. `` I slept fine,'' he answered. My glasses could see straight through his holographic image to the rubbery blue skin underneath. It had taken me a while to get a hang of the Grotfer species' facial expressions, but'worry' was one that I knew well. Derrick and his family were all from the Andromeda galaxy, and they'd been refugees on Earth for the past three years. And they were *constantly* worried that they'd be found out, either by the humans all around them, or the tribal chieftan that they'd betrayed on their own world. \n \n `` No strange dreams?'' I could n't help but enjoy grilling him a bit. Ever know a big secret about someone that is constantly *bursting* to come out? That's my life, every single day. With a thousand different secrets. \n \n Derrick shook his head again, and reached into his backpack for a notebook. `` Hey, did you finish the trig homework for last night? What did you get for Question 7?'' He had learned trigonometry when he was still a pupa, but his family made him go to school and pretend to learn like a normal human. He did n't need help with Question 7, he just did n't want to talk about sleep anymore.

They were certainly learning a lot from their time on Earth. \n \n Our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Kyle. `` t equals -9 Pi divided by 4,'' he answered as he took a seat next to us on the bench. We both rolled our eyes at him ( and Derrick had twice as many eyes as I did ). Unlike Derrick, Kyle had n't quite learned the art of covering up how much he really knew. I'd even had to knock him out a few times and change some of his code to not be such an insufferable know-it-all. The fake data that I'd implanted had taken him down a peg or two when he utterly failed World History. It may sound petty to you, but I *swear* it's in his own interest: who knows how the'people' in this town would react if they found out he was an android? As Caretaker, I could n't let that happen. I had a duty to save him from himself. \n \n The yellow bus pulled up in front of us with a pnuematic hiss and the door popped open with a groan. The three of us climbed on board and headed toward a few open seats near the back. We passed by Mark, the high school quarterback and also werewolf. It was still a week until the full moon, but his 5 o'clock shadow was already at least a centimeter long, and he'd probably shaved it less than an hour ago. He'd look like a full-on lumberjack by 8th period. He was sitting with Susan, who was doing remarkably well on her new set of legs; most mermaids have a hard time adjusting to the surface. We continued down the row past a vampire, some nymphs, a cyclop, a Jinn, and any number of other creatures. They were all wearing their appropriate Supervisor-issued disguises, and each thought that the others were human. \n \n Kyle and Derrick piled into into one seat, leaving no room for me. Derrick shot me a sly look and nodded ever so slightly to the one remaining open seat, behind them and across the row. The other seat there was occupied by none other than Larissa. She glanced up at me, gave a shy smile, then looked straight back down at the book in her lap. It was supposed to look like a biology textbook, but my glasses allowed me to see through her Glamour, revealing the runes and spells that she was studying. I know it's improper for a Caretaker to become... let's say'attached' to one of the subjects, but I could n't help it. Hell, if it were n't for my immunity to her magic, one would think that she'd cast a love spell on me. She was smart, funny, sweet, beautiful... everything I could ask for. And it was just a little crush; what harm could it do? The Supervisors never had to know about that. \n \n I took a step forward and cleared my throat. Kyle and Derrick were snickering and poking me in the back, trying to move me forward into the seat next to her. `` Do.. ahem... do you mind if I... you know...'' I could n't even get the question out. \n \n She blinked with her long lashes and bit her lower lip. `` Sit?'' she asked with a bit of a laugh. \n \n I laughed nervously with her and nodded. And then the brakes of the bus screamed violently and I was thrown to the floor as the vehicle came to a shuddering stop. The other students all piled onto the left side of the bus to look at something. I heard a number of gasps and cries, and the driver scrambled out the front of the bus. I shot Larissa a quick look of apology and slipped quietly out the back. \n \n Old Man Litsch lay in the middle of the street. At least, his torso and upper body did. Most of him had been thrown clear when the driver plowed into him, but his legs were still jammed under the front tires. And he was howling in pain. \n \n `` Another suicide attempt, Litsch?'' I asked. He nodded. It was the fourth attempt this week. Poor guy had definitely had a hard life; I could n't blame him. Nazi experimentation had robbed him of his family and any semblance of normality, but given him the gift of everlasting life. His nickname, `` Old Man,'' was a reference to the fact that he was now the oldest living human on Earth at the ripe old age of 127. And as far as the Supervisors could tell, he'd keep on living regardless of how much he wanted to die. \n \n `` Come on,'' I told the bus driver, who was also a Caretaker. `` Help me put him back together.'' We managed to wrench his legs out from under the tires and put them back into the right place. Tendrils of skin snaked together like stitches and then sucked everything into the right place before sealing up tight, good as new. I helped Litsch to his feet and sent him back to his cardboard mat on the sidewalk surrounded by empty bottles of booze. The Supervisors would probably have to assign a Caretaker just for him soon, because the rest of us were unable to keep track of him and keep cleaning up his messes. \n \n The students were still staring out the bus windows, horrified by what they'd seen. Well, mostly horrified: Gina, the vampire, looked hungry. I held up my Memory Drain device, changed the range to a 30 meter radius, and set it off. I was back on the bus getting everyone back into the seats before they knew what was happening. I smiled at Larissa next to me, still in a bit of a daze and pretending to read her spellbook. At least the Memory Drain had allowed me to bypass that bit of awkwardness. \n \n By the time the effect wore off completely, we were on our way to school as normal and no one else had any recollection of what had happened to Litsch. Just another day for a Caretaker. \n \n -- -- \n \n If you enjoyed this one, you should consider subscribing to \/r\/Luna_Lovewell, too!

In all my years here, as an elven mage instructor in the lands of Eltair, no one has ever possessed magic capabilities like that. She was not even an elf, but a human, those with lesser natural affinity than us. How... It was... Simply impossible. Yet here I was, staring at the impossible. There was no way I could pretend it was not true. This... Human, possessed the purest form of magic ever seen. The robes never lie. I had often dreamt that something like this would happen eventually, but to have it staring before me?! It was n't supposed to happen, yet, it did. The human girl seemed confused at how I stared at her. I would kill to set my own reaction and laugh at his flabbergasted I had looked. But right now, there was a crisis. Well, it was a good crisis, or maybe a terrible one. I just simply had no idea. Placing my palms, now sweaty, back on the elven rosewood desk, I begun to speak, but no words came out from my mouth. The young human giggled; I was probably acting like a fool now. \n \n Here in this village, we use these magical robes to test for the arcane ability of anyone. These robes would then display a different colors with varying intensity all over the robe of the wearer, showcasing their type of magic and affinity to that magic. It was not uncommon to have many different colors on ones robes, but there was always one or two of those colors that stood out. Slightly rarer, were those whose robes were of a single, pure color. It displayed they had great control over a certain element and were often held in very high regard. Many-a-times they became masters in their elements. Then, there was those who had the gold and silver colored robes. It was said that these casters were all destined for greatness. However, news of their magical prowess often spread too far too fast, and many were killed by the age of 16. However, it was rumored that the current elven leader had one of pure gold, but he had never worn his magical robe out in public. The last, were the mythical black and white. Yet, no one in history was said to hold these 2 colors in its purity. Sure, many people had traces of them in their robes, but it was never before seen. \n \n Never before seen my arse. Here it was, right before my eyes. The young child smiled innocently, completely contradicting my reaction. She was calm, collected, and looked down at her white, flowing robe, wondering what was wrong. \n \n `` Erm... Follow me please... Now we need you to meet the headmaster so he can give you a proper introduction to the school'' I lied, trying my best to cover the stuttering my instructions. It was the best thing I could do. Never before had I needed to manage this situation. The procedure was usually a magic affinity test, then signing some forms to confirm your enrollment if you passed. And we're all done. \n \n I got up from my seat, and ushered the girl out, escorting her to he headmasters office. Thankfully, there was no one around, school was out and the only reason I came in was to deal with new enrollments. Escorting the young girl up the stairs, we walked together. My mind was spinning in circles. There was no way the robes lied or failed. Yet, this impossible situation had occurred. It was not before long we arrived at the large oak door that was the headmasters room. Politely asking the girl to wait outside, lying once again that I was making sure we were n't interrupting the headmaster. \n \n I knocked and slowly walked in, leaving her outside. \n \n Entering the room was always made me feel overwhelmed. It was n't the room, but the person in the room that was the source of that. The headmaster was a large man of statute. His face, constantly expressing a serious look intimidating all. The most prominent feature was the scar under his face. But it was not his physical appearance that many feared. It was his magic, his robes had 2 distinct colors, split right down the middle. A bright, stark red and a lush green. A weird combination of magic, but scary nonetheless. Gulping, I began \n \n `` Gandr... The robes... A human girl. Pure white...'' \n \n The old headmaster nodded, taking it in, his face, expressionless. \n \n It was then, behind the doors came muffled cries for help. I recognized it as from talking to the young girl. Mixed with the the cries was laughter. It sounded masculine, probably from one of the boys here at the campus. But no one was supposed to be here. Sure, school was open but no one ever comes back. The hallways are deserted on the holidays. Racing out together with the headmaster, we witnessed a scene that should never have happened. However, before we opened the doors, the sounds were swapped. Now, it was the boys groaning for help. \n \n Running out, what we saw shocked us. The young girl, draining the light from the boy. Out of their eyes came their life force, all being absorbed by the young girl. Her eyes now white, power overflowing out of her arms. Soon, it was not just the their eyes, but from the mouths and nostrils of the young child. I watched in shock and glanced towards Gandr, noticing his eyes widened at the scene. This was the first time I had seen Gandr show any kind of emotion. It was not before long that the corpses went limp. However, they did not only fall limp, but their corpses became black as night. Yet, it was then, that their lifeless corpses once again changed colour. Now slowly turning white as the darkness left them. The blackness on their bodies dropped as though they were shedding, but as dust. Slowly, they crumbled, until revealing a pure, white core. Strangely enough, it glistened although there was no light. Pure as day, white as snow. The young child picked up the 2 gems, and handed them to me. My mouth still open, wondering what I just witnessed. The girl \u2019 s power was unbelievable, and she was still young. \n \n \u201c After you, \u201d Headmaster Gandr said as he held the door open for the two of us.

Will our monsters save us ?\n","story":"The Spear careening into the mountain range unleashed a deafening groan, its neocarbon frame splitting and fraying as it was pierced by the jagged peaks. Bright green and blue blurs could be seen showering upon it as it fell, cracking the hardened plating. If not for the horrifying implications for humanity, it was truly a spectacle. \n \n This was the surface of Marsa Versa, one of the first worlds that the old humans had entered after leaving the Origin System. Never having been favorable for terraforming ( that had of course been the warmer neighbor, Erosa Versa ), its only real purpose was a solid rock in a convenient place in which to build a jump point connecting other systems. \n \n Dakra \u2019 s gaze rolled over the scene, evaluating and calculating. The Spear \u2019 s \u201c Glorious Charge \u201d had been nothing more than a suicide run. \n \n *Fitting. The Proto favored ancient Jap tactics, confusing honorable death with savagery. * \n \n Dakra spat in disgust. He was there when the Defense Council cowered in fear at Chukwu \u2019 s report, had seen the trembling hands vote to activate the Proto Scheme. In retrospect, it sounded silly: clone the dead from millennia ago, use accelerated learning to modernize them, and then wait with hands on hips for them to find a solution. *How gullible they had been. How foolish and irresponsible. * \n \n Clutching the wound at his side, Dakra hunched over and retreated into the cave. The Spear would leave no survivors, the Proto \u2019 s bastardized plan would have seen to that. Even without sabotage, the Scheme had been doomed to failure. Humanity had not come so far through savagery. No, its achievements were the fruit of generations upon generations of intelligence. \n \n Dakra winced and pursed his lips as he descended the ladder, feeling faint and dizzy as he dismounted. His side was festering and reeked harshly. His immune system was wholly unprepared for this pathogen, and it didn \u2019 t help that Chukwu \u2019 s teeth had sunk in so deep. It was unclear when exactly Chukwu \u2019 s nervous system had been infested, when precisely he began his coordination of events that would lead humanity \u2019 s forces to complete collapse, but it had been nothing short of cunning. \n \n The Proto Scheme had been pathetic in their effectiveness, their modernization training undermined by Chukwu \u2019 s endless \u201c modifications \u201d based on falsified battle reports. They had been carefully sculpted to be pathetically useless in directing modern warfare. Alexander, Caesar, Hannibal\u2026 all swept to the side uselessly and expending precious fighters and equipment along with them. \n \n *How wrong we had been. We had thought them savages, our intellect superior. But in their savagery, in their aggression their intellect shines brightly. * \n \n Dakra put a hand in his pocket and clutched the encryption discs tightly as he descended another ladder. In spite of humanity \u2019 s most advanced flagship on fire, useless and strewn in bits over some 300 kilometers, a smile cracked Dakra \u2019 s lips in defiance. \n \n It was a longshot, a \u201c Hail Mary \u201d as the Classic Archives might had referred to it. The encryption discs were old technology, dating back to when the pioneers had arrived on Marsa Versa. These dusty facilities had been long forgotten to most, existing merely as some odd shapes in the hills for the few residents of Marsa Versa. But from reading old planet schematics, Dakra was certain the terminal before him was a critical juncture in maintaining the jump point to the other sectors. \n \n Perhaps the old Earth and the rest of the nearby Origin System would be found and snuffed out. *Unavoidable. Earth and our ancient history will probably be destroyed. But not the other sectors \u2013 no, they CAN NOT have those. * They were loosely populated, but very fertile areas. And at least humanity might have a chance to mount a proper defense. The jump point was a marvel in technological advancement \u2013 the enemy would be completely unable to restabilize the jump without Marsa Versa, maybe even for a few hundred years. And who knows what intellectual marvels humanity could engineer by then? \n \n Or so, that was the hope. Dakra \u2019 s whole torso ached painfully now, 2 full hours after decapitating General Chukwu. He felt an alarming numbness creeping into his neck and a slight haze settling over his vision. \n \n Dacra clenched his fists and steeled his eyes. He shoved the encryption keys into the terminal. \n \n \u201c Hail Mary. \u201d\n"}

He had never let any escape, none after the first. He had killed out of fear then, the first time; the man could still remember the sick feeling afterwards, weeping beside his own corpse, bile rising bitter in his mouth. As time went on he had became addicted to that sickness, the thrill of ending life. The man had summoned this one a few hours ago, after a particularly bitter spat with his fianc\u00e9; he had been particularly cruel in his tortures, relishing the opportunity to outlet his rage on the helpless reflection.

His reflection was weak from the torture and had a noticeable limp; it would tire before long. His fingers tightened around the bloody hammer he gripped in his right hand. Suddenly the reflection turned and ran into a large department store, prying apart the automatic doors before they had time to open themselves. The man followed his reflection and stood inside the entrance, relieved: there was almost no one in the store this time of night, save a couple of workers stocking shelves or gossiping by the registers. He would be able to finish the job here in private, the body would disappear after a few minutes just like the rest, and then he could return to life as usual. \n \n The reflection sprinted down isle after isle, madly fleeing its pursuer.

He stopped short, however, when he saw the sign nailed to the door: \u201c Changing Room \u201d. A current of fear arced down his spine, his conscious mind struggling to come to the conclusion that his gut had reached instantly. Could a reflection summon a reflection? \n \n The door burst open and they came at him at once, four of them, four of him. Two of them tackled him to the ground and pinned down his arms, one restrained his legs. The fourth stood over him, raining down vicious kicks on his face, his throat, his groin. For what seemed like an eternity they beat him; eventually he managed to open his mouth, spitting out a couple of teeth before speaking: \u201c Please! Let me live. Let me live.

Just *how* did you do this, human?'' She shook her head, reaching to pick up a desk phone, which she tapped a few numbers on before holding it to her ear. `` No, not *human*. *Lord*.'' \n \n `` Lord? What?'' Trey asked, `` Are you sure there was n't some sort of mix-up? I really do n't recall ever-'' \n \n The demon put a finger to her lips, uttering a harsh'*shhhhh*'. She swiveled her chair away from him, and whispered into the phone's mouthpiece in an almost conspiratorial way. Not long after that did the door burst open, as two burly demons entered the room. Trey was unceremoniously dragged away, after that, despite his claims of innocence. \n \n A short while later, Trey abruptly landed before a massive throne, ringed by nearly-nude seductresses, flames, and obsidian. Upon the throne sat a grand and proud-looking male specimen, with two large horns upon his ashen-skinned forehead. \n \n `` Damn, guys, do n't just throw him to the ground,'' the demon shouted, standing up from the throne. He made his way down the steps, hauled Trey to his feet, and dusted the man off. `` You're among nobility, here. From what I was told, this guy's a bona-fide sociopath.'' \n \n `` Wh-What? No, now I'm really confused,'' Trey said, taking a step back in some attempt to put distance between himself and the overbearing demon. `` I stole once, sure, but that was when I was a kid. I seriously did n't ever do anything bad- not on *purpose*...'' \n \n `` That's just it, Trey. Not on **purpose**,'' the demon said. He offered his hand forward. `` I'm Satan. We're gon na get to know each other pretty well in the coming eternity.'' \n \n Trey's skin went pale. What could he have done, to deserve this fate? To shake hands with the devil, of all beings. Resigning himself, he slowly reached forward and took Satan's hand. `` S-Sure...'' \n \n `` So, man, you got ta tell me what your secret was,'' Satan said. He stepped around to Trey's side, to put an arm over the man's shoulders in an oddly brotherly way. `` Not many guys like you in *history*, let alone the past thousand years.'' \n \n `` I do n't even know why I'm here,'' Trey admitted. Still, he was clueless. He lived his life in a pure way, did well in school, got a well-paying job, a beautiful wife whom he cherished... \n \n `` They did n't tell you?'' Satan asked. `` The fuck do I employ'em for... Anyway, it was about your wife. You treated her like *garbage*, man.'' \n \n `` What? No, I did not,'' Trey said. His face went pale once more. `` I treated her like a goddess. We were married for over sixty years. She-'' \n \n `` You hid all sorts of stuff from her, though,'' said Satan, shrugging with one arm. `` Teabags, and cutlery... you left the toilet seat up, and put shit on the floor. Really, man, you're almost as evil as I am. And I'm *Satan*!'' \n \n It was around that time that it finally dawned upon Trey. `` Oh, Lord...'' he cursed under his breath. \n \n `` My wife was blind.'' \n \n -- - \n \n I like writing about demons and stuff I guess.

Every day the boy would come around and steal from him, his precious seeds and branches to use for playing silly games. He would climb up his trunk cluttering up his eloquently laid branches and perfectly aligned leaves. He was perfect, and the boy was messing it up. The tree was angry. \n \n Years came and went and the boys children started to play on him. Finally, the tree came up with a plan and spoke to one of the children. \n `` Child, what do you want?'' The tree said with devious intent \n `` To play and remain here for the rest of my life'' \n `` Then let it be, you can play on all of my branches'' The boy was delighted and started to climb. Finally, he was on the most beautiful branch and the tree decided it was time. The tree separated his most beloved branch and watched the child fall. The tree was finally happy. \n \n The tree watched the cars come and leave. Tears that fell and cries that were heard delighted the tree with utmost pleasure. No one would ever play on him again and he could make beautiful branches once again. That was until their second child carved his name with his lovers into his delicate bark. The hatred stored up over the years of peace were all released onto the boy's family once again. \n \n The tree talked to the termites living within him. `` Go to that house over there and help me destroy them'' \n \n The termites questioned and replied'' If we do this for you, let us eat you more'' Without hesitation the tree agreed, and the house was ruined. The tree fought through the pain of the termites eating him by watching the boys life fall into ruin as the house cost more money. He watched as his wife left him for spending so much and the tree was happy and could look pretty once again. \n \n More years passed and the boy was an old man who sat down at the base of the tree. `` I have faced trial and turmoil and now I am old and wise. I have lived a decent life and a peaceful one, even if it was not always pleasant'' The tree was surprised at how he could remain so happy. Did he not see the beauty he destroyed his first time up the tree. The tree was angry enough he called to the winds and asked for assistance in being pushed over. \n \n `` But wo n't you surely die?'' They asked \n \n `` I do not care, I am not happy'' \n \n `` And you will never be,'' Said the winds, finally getting rid of this eyesore on the forest. As the tree crushed the boy the tree was happy in succeeding in this last task. \n \n `` At least, I died old and happy,'' Said the boy, with a smile on his face as his last breath left him. The tree was sad at the fact the boy was forever happy, and died with the knowledge, that he had not taken anything from the boy that would stop him.\n"}

The big city not exactly being known for its wide expanses of earthy splendor, I did what you do. I flushed him. Apparently Mr. Sparkles had n't been dead. And now he was back, with a vengeance.

The source of this annoyance was my hands. They had begun to glow. It looked a bit like somebody had held a camera flash behind my hand, kind of cool that you could just make out the bones and the veins and stuff. I freaked out a little at first, my hands looked like they were about to start melting! I was then vexed by this anomaly, and did all of the things a normal person would do, washing them mostly. They looked almost ok under a bright light, slightly opalescent, but ok. Mum certainly was n't impressed. `` what the hell have you been touching boy?'' First thought was `` ya mum!'' But it did n't really work in this scenario. `` I swear it just happened. I woke up like this!'' `` That one wo n't save you this time Jimmy. Just tell me!'' Dad came to my rescue, and thought it was pretty cool, much to mums annoyance. `` Does it hurt? No? Cool! Lets see if you can set stuff on fire!'' So the first day was spent sticking my hand into petrol and various other flammable solids\/liquids\/gases, encouraged by my somewhat irresponsible father. I do n't think he thought very far ahead on that one. \n \n To cut my school day the next day story short, lets just say that we did n't do much learning. Mum told me to keep the gloves on, in the middle of Queensland summer. Which lasted about 5 seconds into my school day. The rest was great. `` how did you do it Jimmy'' `` I dunno.'' `` Come on who gave you your powers?'' `` Ya mum.'' Heh. \n \n By the third day at school I had made local news.

Weeks, practically *months* after everyone else got one, I've been bestowed with a Power. I have no idea why I got it, how I got it, or what I should do with it - but I'm one of them now. I'm a hero. \n \n I fling myself off of my bed with uncharacteristic vigor. I do n't bother gathering supplies for classes today - not like I'm going to attend any of them anyway. I gel back my hair with a few clumsy swipes of a comb and throw on a pair of jeans. I consider my choice of shirt for a few seconds, before deciding on a screen-printed red-and-black T-shirt that my roommate made for his death metal band. I contemplate scratching off the name on the back, but I'll be wearing a coat anyway, so no one will see it. I'll get a proper costume later. My dark red jacket completes the look. I look in the mirror above my bed and I see a *beast* look back. Damn. *This is going to be one hell of a day. * \n \n The dorm hall is empty this late in the morning. I take the opportunity to test out my heroic swagger. Every hero has to look confident, and the way you walk is the best sign of self-image. A few steps into the unnatural, swingy gait and I reconsider. *Maybe I can just puff out my chest, or laugh a lot, or something. Ah, I'll figure that out later. * I abandon the hallway and race to the second-floor lounge, the only one with a working TV. It's usually filled with procrastinating Lit majors and assorted slackers.

Nice shirt.'' \n \n Jerry is the only one here. He's sitting at a table, shuffling a deck of cards. Ever since he got supernatural luck, he's been shunned by most other students. It turns out that for Jerry to be lucky, someone else has to be unlucky. \n \n `` Where is everyone? Usually they're milling around here, watching Food Network or something.'' \n \n Jerry composes his face into a small sneer. `` They're in the third-floor lounge. Kyle built a projector or something, and he set up a fighting games tournament. No reason to stay here, I guess...'' Jerry slowly deals five cards onto the table. Royal flush. \n \n `` Oh.'' I consider showing him my power, but I want to make an impression on people that *matter*. No offense to Jerry, but... `` I should get up there then. Uh, see you.'' I turn on my heel and run face-first into the closed door. *Jerry. * \n \n Before I enter the third-floor lounge, I hear pulsating, bass-heavy techno music echo through the hallway. I open the door and am immediately greeted by someone's forehead meeting my gut. My breath vacates the premises of my lungs, and I fall onto the carpet. \n \n `` THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM, YOU BASTARD! I'LL - Oh, hey Dan. You okay?'' Yasmin looks through the door, past the human projectile that knocked me down, towards me on the floor. She probably threw whoever this is through the door with her mind bullets or whatever she calls it. \n \n `` Hffffggghhhh... Y-yeah. Fine, great. Doing okay. Not dead.'' I roll onto my side and lever myself into a standing position. `` What did this guy do?'' \n \n `` What? Nothing. What do you - Oh, you mean, why did I telekinesis him through here?'' She shakes her head. `` I did n't mean to throw him out the door, just *into* it.

This counts as a ring-out, K.O. number 2... Yep.'' He turns back to the room. `` Yasmin takes another round! Move'er up!'' \n \n Cheers and hisses ring from inside the lounge. I look inside. Instead of the lounge I know - battered couches, a broken CRT TV, and a single rickety card table - there's a large, empty space in the middle of the room, and a few levels of stadium-style bleachers on one wall. I turn to Kyle. `` What, exactly, is going on here? This is not the lounge.'' \n \n `` No, it's the lounge,'' Kyle says with a spark in his eye. `` I've just expanded it a little bit. I rigged up a space-projection manifold with my microwave and some binder clips, so we could set this tournament up.'' He blinks at me. `` Did you want to enter? It's really only for people with powers...'' \n \n My mind snaps back to where it should have been this whole time. I'm ready to blow these people's minds. `` Kyle, my man. *I have powers*.''

He begins to walk off. \n \n `` Wait, wait wait wait! I have powers! I'm a superhero, Kyle!'' \n \n `` Great, Dan.'' Kyle waves at me halfheartedly, then steps in front of the bleachers. `` Losers' bracket, round 3! Paul, Ulrich, get up here!'' \n \n Two guys - I think I recognize them from the lacrosse team - stand up and move to the center of the unnaturally large room. *I ca n't believe this - Kyle does n't even care! * I open my mouth a few times, but ca n't think of anything to say. The situation in which I find myself defies explanation. \n \n Yasmin taps me on the shoulder. `` We should get out of the way.'' She leads me to an open spot on the bleachers, and I sit down as the lacrosse players begin to fight. One of them is throwing punches, the other is... spitting.

Our nation lived in fear daily during the New Way. General Iso's reign held us all by our throats. \n \n He rose to power in the late 80's, bringing with him a hellfire of oppression and tyranny. Women and children too weak to work were cast out, forced to live in squalor on the cities outskirts. Men were forced into laborious jobs with little to no pay. Mostly just taking enough home to feed themselves so they did n't die of starvation during their next shift. The higher up citizens were dragged down from the metaphorical thrones. With General Iso's New Way, he brought a cult of followers, all taking the places of the most prestigious positions within the government. \n \n They confiscated weapons and evicted citizens into ghettos. With everyone locked behind the walls of the city, the crowds were easier to control. Any time a small group tried to rebel, Iso's enforcers rained fire and smoke down upon them. Tear gas filled the lungs of anyone attempting to escape or rebel, incapacitating them. \n \n So they worked in the shadows. For years a small group of people joined together, vowing to bring down Iso once and for all. And it took nearly 3 decades. \n \n They became invisible, going about their day-to-day routines, taking extreme care to not stand out. The less the guards noticed them the better. They worked jobs in the mines and in the city. Smuggling in what they could to prepare for the day of reckoning. Miners hid shovels and picks back among the piles of coal. City workers hid any tool they could get their hands on. Everything became a weapon. Soon, the rebellion would be strong enough to strike. \n \n After a long enough time, some citizens allied with enforcers who shared the same beliefs. Even the soldiers under Iso's command wanted change. Over the years the alliance grew. The two sides working together to bring a brighter future to their home. \n \n After nearly thirty years of preparation, everything was in order. They planned to strike before day break. When the morning fogs would shroud them. \n \n At once, every single rebel and soldier turned traitor struck. Like a crouching tiger with a thousand thousand claws, the rebels pounced on their oppressors. Slashing at their throats, bleeding them dry. \n \n Blood ran deep in the city streets as the traitors made their way toward the capitol building. They stormed the doors. With every hand knocking, not waiting for an answer, they tore through the threshold. \n \n Making their way up the stairs, and down hallway after hallway. Guards were at the ready, but still unprepared. The rebellion dispatched them like weeds in the grass. \n \n Finally, they were at General Iso's chambers.

He boomed, standing in full military uniform, medals polished and gleaming in the morning sun streaming through the halls windows. \n \n `` For 27 Years you have terrorized this country, you have crippled this country and its people, so we have come to cripple you. It is time to step down.'' \n \n `` STEP DOWN, STEP DOWN!'' The rebellion chimed in unison. \n \n `` This is ill advised, and unnecessary.

I only ask one thing.'' \n \n `` What could you possibly ask of us? You have taken everything, we have nothing left to give.''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The Safe\n","story":"*Last time I saw something like `` you know what this phrase means,'' I was horribly wrong and ended up being way off topic. No, I do n't know what safe you mean. Does n't mean I wo n't write something. * \n \n -- -- - \n \n These old houses were filled with secrets. That's what got me into this salvage business. My partner, Sara, scouted the places and I financed them. The 20's were good for the line of work. Bootleggers built hidden compartments to hide bottles of their latest. Later owners found some of them, but many were left untouched. \n \n Our latest house was one Sara said we just had to buy. It had been in the news many years ago. The family had gone crazy or something, claiming they heard voices. One day, they packed up and left. The wife's body was recovered two states over. The father and kids were never found. The house was haunted according to the internet. I know that there's no such things as ghosts, so all that meant was a nice little discount. \n \n From day one, it was a home that kept on giving. The attic had all sorts of knick knacks boxed up including some jewelry. Then we started hunting for the hidden treasures. We pulled a plastic dinosaur out of a hatch by the small bedroom. The raptor did n't have feathers, so we knew it must have been old. \n \n If you knew what to look for, things like an uneven door jamb, a seam in moulding, and sections of wall that served no obvious purpose, they were easy enough to find. The frame by the cellar housed a bottle filled with something undoubtedly alcoholic. The glass was caked in black muck with no sign of a label. Neither of us were interested in cracking it open; adventure only goes so far. That bottle was history. \n \n While that period booze was off limits, our curiosity was too much when the loose sheet of drywall in the study proved to be concealing a large metal box, a safe, roughly six feet tall complete with the steering wheel handle and combination dial. Like the booze, there were signs of age. Rust dotted patches of the surface. \n \n It's almost scary how effecient Craigslist can be. Neither my partner or I knew a damned thing about safes, let alone how to open one. But with a picture of the door, we had half a dozen guys claiming they could get it open. One of the guys we had used before on another job; he was amenable to doing the job and leaving without questions. There were lower bids, but discretion was worth the extra cash. \n \n And he earned his keep. He brought some tools to break the hinges, but the old lock was easy enough for him to crack by hand. When the door swung open just enough to assure its unlocked state, Sara's eagerness was front and center as she urged me to see the guy out. This was the first safe I had seen, so my excitement matched hers. Without regard for what the locksmith might see, I pulled open the door, oblivious to my partner's objections. \n \n The interior of the door caught my attention first. As the long, chaotic scratches were unnerving, but the sensation was broken by the smell of rot. It was n't unheard of for people to dump their trash and waste and forget about it. This stench was almost as awful. There was a pile of fabric reaching halfway up. with some papers sticking out from underneath. I pulled the top garmet, a small shirt with a Superman logo. But one sleeve was stuck. As I tugged, the tiny fingers hidden under the clothes poked through. \n \n Before I could express my horror, my ears burst as the gun discharged. The locksmith fell to the ground, motionless. Sara turned the gun to me. \n \n `` Thanks for finding my brother. I really have missed him all these years.'' \n \n `` Brother?'' it still was n't registering. `` Who are you?'' \n \n `` Just a ghost, according to some.'' \n \n How could she wear that grin? She just shot a man dead. \n \n `` You killed that child in the safe?'' \n \n `` Liam? That was an accident, honest. Silly me, I forgot the combination.'' \n \n She chuckled as if she had cracked a joke. \n \n `` So then, is this what it's all been about? Finding him? Well you found him? Is n't that enough?!'' \n \n `` tsk tsk tsk. Indoor voices.'' She wiggled the gun around for emphasis. `` Yes, I forgot which house was ours. Do n't get me wrong, Evan. It's been a real hoot playing house with you these last few years, but you know what they say: family first.'' \n \n The bullet ripped through the base of my shoulder before I even saw a shot. I collapsed. \n \n As Sara dragged me into the safe, now free of the child's body and freshly loaded with that of a locksmith, she continued making conversation. My slipping consciousness made it a one-sided affair. \n \n `` My parents were worried sick about him just after, so I had to cover my tracks. Whispers in the vents were all it took to get them talking ghosts. They panicked and fled before bothering with the police. Mother got suspicious, but that was easily taken care of on the road.'' \n \n Delirious, I was only just aware that I was sitting on a corpse with the light fading as the safe door started to close. \n \n `` Sweet dreams,'' Sara cooed. \n \n With the little energy I had left, I pulled free the dinosaur figurine from my pocket, but it fell. The light became a crack, growing smaller and smaller. Then it stopped shrinking. \n \n `` What the-'' \n \n The door opened slightly to help free the toy whose head prevented the door from closing fully. The plan was to bolt, but I was too weary. All I could muster was falling forwards. I could hear the heavy door hit Sara in the head. On the hardwood floor, I saw her unconscious body sprawled by her brother's. Crawling over, inching forwards with my good arm, I fished through her pockets for her phone, dialed 9-1-1, and passed out.\n"}

Whereas before I had only ever seen the perfect suppleness of young flesh and muscle before me now was an antithesis; a simultaneous tautness and looseness of flesh stapled across a frame vacant of even a flicker of light. He was not like the corpse of an eternally young vessel; preserved for all time, an embodiment of both life and death. What I saw that day was a mockery of both; life prolonged but not preserved, death \u2019 s smile visible behind ancient flesh. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're a State Farm agent and are often summoned by your clients to reassure them in their time of need , usually through the jingle . One day , you are summoned by two people at the same time .\n","story":"I heard rumors about the State Farm Hyperverse, but I always brushed those off as nothing more than scary stories usually shared with new agents. They never referred to it by name during training, why would they? It was never a place we would visit, just a place we would pass through on our way to a call, just a fraction of a second. They never got into the science of things, or how it worked, it just did and as far as we knew everything was and has always been safe. State Farm had been using this method of customer interaction since the early 80's, and during that time they became the largest private home, auto and life insurer in the world. Never the less my curiosity was peaked and I asked one of our trainers if anyone had been ever lost on way to a call. He laughed and said `` it's just simply never happened, I do n't know how it could.'' \n \n I'll tell you how, two customers calling for you at once, that's how. The chances of this happening are astronomical of course. You hear about agents getting transported to another call while in the middle of a call every now and then, but it happens like once a year rare. 13 million worldwide agents each insuring a couple hundred clients a piece, most of who they'll never hear from again after the initial contract signing. But somehow two clients managed to call on me at the same time. \n \n I still do n't know who summoned me, or why. All I know is I'm here in this white void of space. There's a floor, it's white. There's no walls, or ceilings, just white. I spend days walking in what I think is a straight line, but could've just as easily been a circle. At this point I know death is near. I'm mentally and physically exhausted. I have n't eaten, or drank or slept in god knows how long. I miss my kids, and my wife. I'm waiting for the next breath not to come, and to finally know peace. \n \n I hear music. Off in the distance, but I can hear it. Likely a hallucination brought on by extreme fatigue, but still I walk towards what I believe the source to be. There in the middle of nowhere, in the white void, was a bar. With the last of my energy I sprinted towards the bar. Best case scenario, it's a bar and they'll have water and food. Worst case scenario, it's a hallucination and I'll die from the exhaustion. \n \n As I get closer I notice two figures at the bar. One standing behind the bar minding to the glasses, and one sitting at it. `` It ca n't be a hallucination'' I say to myself as the smell of beer and pub cheese fills my nostrils. When I step up to the bar and notice the man sitting at the end of the bar is actually a caveman. `` That's odd'', I thought, when I saw the bartender turn to talk to me. \n \n `` Can I get you something.'' She asked. She was a pale skinned woman with jet black hair and red lipstick. She wore a white apron over a white blouse and slacks. I leaned in to read her name tag. \n \n `` Flo, I need help.''\n"}

Unfortunately, he didn \u2019 t notice that in between sobs and cries, the girl had freed her foot from his loose binding and presently was able to land a hard kick on his inflated right ankle. Normally this wouldn \u2019 t matter, but her blood was greasing the floor, and in one swift motion Simon was down. \n \n \u201c Ooohhh... \u201d The warehouse was a sad mix of cries and struggles to be free ( intermixed with kicking at the now downed captor ) and moans of pain from Simon. He lifted his head, breathed out heavily, and dropped it back to the floor. \n \n A few hours later, as he came to with a gun and badge in his face, he wondered at the merits of being a hitman in this day and age. \u201c Perhaps my skill set, \u201d he thought to himself as they roughly mirandized him and shoved his head down into the car, \u201c will be better utilized in prison.

There was one empty sleeve which, after studying his surroundings, Oliver filled with a photo of a dark skinned man in a suit. The man was like the others in two ways: He was a man and he had used his one legally allowed kiss on Oliver. \n \n \n Another full book, thought Oliver, clapping shut the binder. \n \n \n With a long exhale, he collapsed backwards onto his couch and closed his eyes. For a moment, his mind was filled with faces and he began mumbling numbers: \n \n \n `` One, that's twenty. Three twenty, sixty. Sixty-five. Plus ten, seventy-five.'' \n \n \n Seventy-five, Oliver thought. Alexander Dignam was killed for ten but I ca n't stop. I've taken seventy-five lovestruck kisses from seventy-five love-needing men who I will never see again. `` Do you know what this means? This kiss?'' they would say. In school they taught us `` A kiss is a marriage, a marriage is once and forever, a kiss is forever.'' So then: Forever and ever and ever these men married a collector. \n \n \n Oliver smiled and reveled in finishing another book. Then he sighed and covered his face. He knew what they would do to him. He imagined himself standing vulnerable in the gaze of a judge, his hands tied in the front, and the whole world watching and waiting. Evidence would be presented: The photo albums, the scrapbooks, the eye-witnesses. And then it would end on the range with rifles aimed from twenty yards at his face. \n \n \n These thoughts made Oliver feel frail, like he was made out of glass, like one wrong move and he would be shattered. His parents would deny him, seventy-five men would never forget. He would have no funeral, be read no rites. His name on the page of the paper would be next to `` Enemy of the State,'' or `` Serial Kisser,'' or `` Heretic.'' \n \n \n This sent a twinge through his nerves and stiffened all the tiny hairs that glazed his body. Adrenaline pushed through every muscle of his body as he lay there on the couch soaking in the gravity of what he had become until the quiet night brought him to a dream. \n \n \n `` Olly,'' said a voice. `` Hey, wake up.'' \n \n \n Oliver rolled over and was greeted by a beautiful young face. \n \n \n `` Wake up,'' she said again. \n \n \n `` I'm up, I'm up,'' replied Oliver. \n \n \n `` I wan na talk.'' \n \n \n `` Sh\u2014 sure.

Why are the Magisters so obsessed with towers? No building in the academy has less than eight flights of stairs. I \u2019 m amazed none of the tutors have had a heart attack yet. \n \n Sparing a glance out of one of the little windows I can see the sun is almost at its zenith. Great\u2026 I \u2019 m running late. Again. \n \n I skidded to a halt just outside the office door. Quickly, I tried to flatten down my robe a touch, straighten my lanyard and pull my hair into something resembling tidy. With Magister Antonious the only thing worse than showing up late, was showing up late and unpresentable. \n \n I pushed the door open quietly, peering round the door into the Magister \u2019 s office, hoping he was too engrossed in his studies to notice the time. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re late Adept, no amount of sneaking will change that \u201d he said without looking up from his scroll. \n \n I quickly closed the door and opened my mouth to try and explain my tardiness. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t bother with the excuses Adept, I \u2019 ve heard then all before and quite frankly don \u2019 t care \u201d he took a breath from his pipe \u201c Because of your tardiness, you \u2019 ll be doing syntactic research tonight. \u201d \n \n I ground my teeth, biting back a number of impolite responses. \n \n Syntactic research is the most mind numbing, draining aspects of thaumatological research. It amounts to sitting up all night saying random words and pouring power into then, hoping it makes a functioning spell. It \u2019 s grunt work for a first year Academ, not an Adept in the last time year of their apprenticeship. Thinking better than to argue with the academy \u2019 s finest researcher, I strode off towards one of the periphery research chambers. \n \n The chamber was tiny, less than my arm span across, and rather spartan. The only things in there were a timepiece opposite the door, a candle in a alcove on the wall, and a bronze circle inlaid in the floor. \n \n \u201c Shas \u2019 Xen \u201d I muttered, hand extended toward the candle. A purple flame flicked to life atop it, unnaturally still and steady. \n \n I dumped my satchel in the corner and pull out book and a quill, to note any combinations that actually manifested a spell. Slumping down into the circle, I decided to start with some simple augments. Take a spell, throw a bit on the end and see if anything happens. \n \n \u201c Shas \u2019 Xen \u2019 Paru \u201d I breathed, forcing a little energy into it. As soon as I finished speaking a spear of pain slammed into my head, feedback from an incomplete spell that left my ears ringing. I took a steadying breath. \n \n \u201c Shas \u2019 Xen \u2019 Topah \u201d again greeted by feedback. \u201c Shas \u2019 Xen \u2019 Ru \u201d this time there was no feedback. A small flame appeared in my palm. \n \n A completed spell, quickly as well. \n \n Which then started screaming. Loudly. \n \n I promptly slammed my palm shut, cutting of the spell and the screaming. Once my ears stopped ringing, I pulled my notebook forward and scribbled a quick note. \n \n Shas \u2019 Xen \u2019 Ru. \n \n Mage-light base, banshee like augment. \n \n Minimal energy change. \n \n Applications -??? \n \n With that I set the book down and turned my mind back to more augments. \n \n -- - \n \n \u201c Dao \u2019 Rae \u2019 Duun \u201d I mumbled, another surge of feedback jolted away my weariness, if only for a second. \n \n I slumped back, resting my head against the cold stone wall. I peered toward the timepiece, squinting in the low light and through fatigue. According to it, the sun would be setting right about now. \n \n My note book sat across from me, only half a dozen entries from tonight, all minor augments to existing spells. Not a bad result, just not enough to impress the Magister either. \n \n if I want to avoid doing this again and again for the next few weeks then I need something substantial. Straightening up, I settled in the circle with my legs folded beneath me and my eyes closed. \n \n They say that talented Magisters have a knack for spells, that they can just feel which words are going to doing something. So I sat, modulated my breathing, and tried to focus in the now. Then just said whatever felt right. No pattern, no logic. \n \n \u201c Durven Vardesh \u201d I breathed, feeling the words click as the spell completed. The energy lurched out of me, enough to darken my vison and leave me panting on the floor. \n \n Looking around, nothing seems to have changed. No burst of flame, no change of shape, no teleportation or summoned phantom. No new sights, sounds or smells. \n \n Wait. No sounds at all. \n \n I stared at the timepiece for a long moment and it stayed dead still, none of the arms moving and no gears turning. \n \n This was something new! This was something that might impress the Magister. Even if it \u2019 s just another silencing charm, it could still have its uses.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're the world 's best photographer . Your secret ? You can freeze time . You last photo brings some suspicion up .\n","story":"``'Perfect-timing Bill', that's what they call me. And I seem indeed to have an uncanny ability to get the perfect shots at the perfect moment - my `` jumping people'' pictures are always great, I catch the funniest superpositions, my wildlife pictures are gaped at, I have a stockpile of pictures of things that fall, break or explode. \n \n To the people who ask me how I do it, I play the modesty card - `` you know, it's a bit of luck, a fair amount of practice, and for every picture that you see, hundreds do n't make the cut''. I'm not lying. I do take a lot of pictures to get the right one. And I suppose it does take a bit of luck and experience to snap my fingers at exactly the right moment to freeze time. \n \n I've been called a cheater, a fraudster, a bad photoshopper. The irony of that is not lost on me. I defeated all the claims, one by one. Some people are still not convinced, but then again, some people are still not convinced we went to the Moon. \n \n The cover of `` best photographer in the world'' explains my luxury lifestyle. Obviously, my photography gear is everything money can buy and then some. My house has been sold to me as a'manor', my garage contains three very shiny red sports cars. I still have a reputation as a philanthropist - it's only natural, after all, to give back to the populations and places that allowed me to take such great pictures. \n \n It took me a surprisingly long time to understand that this gift could be used for other purposes. I ca n't say that I've never taken the opportunity to unzip the fly of an annoying customer or to lift a garment. Interacting with frozen people creeps me out, though, so I stopped doing that. It was probably more of an incentive to stop than the fear of getting caught. \n \n Over the years, I improved my technique. I did n't want to get caught, so I went to great lengths to ensure that my freezing the time did n't get detected. The most obvious thing is to come back to the original pose when I am done. The second obvious thing is to never shoot from an impossible angle that the client would have noticed. That's why I like wildlife pictures: an eagle will not be suspiscious at the angle at which you caught its best side view. And if I'm not actually taking pictures, well, I can hide somewhere, or I can pretend to re-tie my shoe, or that sort of things, before I snap my fingers. Small thefts were not really possible: if I steal a handbag in the street, there's a fair chance it's going to be seen. Larger thefts are more profitable and easier, assuming they happen in a place where no-one is actually standing and wondering how the thing they were looking at disappeared in front of their eyes. \n \n What I had never really taken into account, though, was that although human beings would probably not notice the minutiae of my position, the CCTV in front of my targets would. And that eventually someone would make the connection between the multiple occurrences of a guy shifting from a few centimeters in the vicinity of every bank and jewelry shop that had been mysteriously broken in this past decade. \n \n And that's why colleagues caught me, Detective. I do n't think I will ever forget the three knocks at my door at 6AM this morning, or the first sentence your constable said to me:'William Stasis? You're under arrest for multiple counts of burglary and grand theft.' But then again... `` \n \n William grinned and snapped his fingers.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write about one of your childhood dreams .\n","story":"Audrey and I looked at each other through the reflection of the lake, and she smiled at me. The sun was setting, and the orange light reflecting off of the water made Audrey look like an Egyptian goddess. She was beautiful, but I would be lying if I said that the lack of pigment on her skin did n't bother me. She looked up from the water and swung her bare feet off of the rock we were sitting on. I looked up too, meeting her hollow eyes. \n \n `` Tell me how it feels again, Michael'' Audrey said. \n \n `` I've told you hundreds of times.'' I replied as I reached my toes into the water. A chill went up my spine. \n \n `` I know, I just like hearing you talk about it.'' \n \n I could n't help but smile. I told her everything I could about how the icy water felt. Or how the hard cold rock under my bottom was uncomfortable. And how my hair falling onto the back of my neck and bare shoulders tickled, and sometimes made me shiver. \n \n Everytime I described these senses to her, I tried to delve into further detail, sometimes I would even make things up just to see her smile and ponder what I meant by `` itchy'' or `` tingle''. \n \n Audrey would n't know for sure, of course, because Audrey is a ghost. Or at least, we think that she is. There's no way to know for sure, I guess. I guess is a phrase a use a lot given my circumstances. \n \n Audrey and I live next to our lake, in our forest. I can still feel, but we think that we have been here for the same amount of time. I do n't remember a life without Audrey, and she does n't remember much of one without me either. \n When I opened my eyes all of those years ago to silver hair flowing over my face, and the yellow mid day sun shining through the strands causing me to squint, I was afraid. The sun made her thin hair seem like strands of metal, and the first time I heard her voice I thought it was the metal strands rubbing together. Her voice is frightening, and if she could feel she would have felt my head bump into hers as I hurriedly sat up. \n \n `` Who are you?'' Was all she said. \n \n I opened my mouth to answer, and was confused when nothing came out. Who am I? \n \n `` I... do n't really know.'' I managed to say, my words stumbling over each other as if I had just learned to speak. I was finding my bearings, and for some reason I did n't start to panic. I just sat there, staring at this strange girl. She could n't have been older than 14. How old was I? \n \n `` Well how do you like the name Michael? It sticks out to me.'' She said as she sat back and crossed her legs, gently laying her hands onto her knees. It was at this moment I realized she was naked, and my stomach sunk. \n \n Looking at her almost stung my eyes, her pale skin reflected the sun better than the lake that sat twenty feet from where I had just woken up. I got angry for a second. Angry because I was confused. And just as I was about to lash out at her, a thought came into my mind. I thought that was n't created in the last five minutes, no, something deeper than that. \n \n `` Audrey.'' I whispered. \n \n `` I do n't mind that! Well Michael, call me Audrey!'' Her broken record player voice screeched. \n \n It took me a few minutes to look at her again. And a few days to be able to speak to her. It took months to respond to Michael, and it may have taken years to get used to her voice. \n \n Now, I do not know how much time has passed, but my hair touches my neck and my bare shoulders, and all that matters is the setting sun and Audrey's pale smile. A snap of a tree branch rang out from behind us, and both of our heads turned in time to see the branch hit the ground.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Tell a story about a haunted house from the ghost 's perspective .\n","story":"I can not walk through walls. I can not even open doors if God does not will it so. While studying the knick-knacks of my grandson \u2019 s dresser, the museum of disassociated memories, someone shut the door, trapping me in the bedroom during their summer holiday. They went to Cape Cod. I am stuck in Providence in the house I grew up in. \n \n I remember closing my eyes while I laid on a hospital gurney, staring up at a fluorescent light while my daughters wept and sung Sweet Caroline to me. That was their mother \u2019 s name. I would tease their mother, singing it to her. When she died, I could not listen to the radio since if by some circumstance the song would come on, my productivity ceased for the day with me falling asleep on a couch. My daughter \u2019 s sung `` Good times never felt so good'' to me as I passed, and I woke up on the couch. I looked around and the house was empty. Boxes were being packed with my belongings. I am not a dense man. When my family came home in their Sunday best, and my son-in-law stared through me while he took off his coat, I knew that I existed on a shared reality, but not on theirs alone. \n \n I searched for Caroline in the house. She was not here with me. Was there another place she called home that was not where we grew old and raised our babies? I grieved selfishly and asked God every day if I did not have to spend eternity alone. His response was cold and spiteful. I became acutely aware to the menacing noises around my house. Phantoms and ghouls haunting my family. I stopped a malignant spirit from climbing in through a window. He cracked open the window, and with all my might I slammed the windows down on his fingers, snapping them. He howled, causing Eric and Sabrina to awaken and investigate the noise. They found the window slightly open, and their flowerbed trampled. They called the police and had a security system installed. \n \n The house was my daughter \u2019 s inheritance, and the ghost of her father is an amenity. I realized that I am not a prisoner, but a warden. God had kept me close to my family so I can be a guardian angel. Within the walls of the house they will stay protected by my constant vigil. I patrolled the hallway, then relaxed across the couch and watch the television that nobody bothered to turn off when everyone went to bed. \n \n The week of the vacation made me feel stir crazy. I watched the window like a dog hoping they would all return safe. Without responsibility I felt as useless at the toys collecting dust on my grandson \u2019 s dresser. I started to think abstractly. Wouldn \u2019 t it be fun to scare my family from time to time? Make them sit up in their beds, their eyes seeking rapidly around their room for the noise that woke them? Grandpa \u2019 s teasing us again. I shook my head and resolved not to think of such nonsense. I began to sympathize with the ghouls. They were probably just like me at one point until they were abandoned by their families and left in an empty house. The families that moved in afterwards would either have to get used to the eccentric stranger amongst them or move. \n \n I wondered what would happen if the family moved. Would I travel with them, tethered to my descendents like a kite? Or would my existence cease with my function? I thought about the ghouls again. I wondered if my disassociation would change me. The children of new homeowners searching in the dark with flashlights, looking for the noises that old houses make. Would I transform with their imaginations? Would I grow giant gnarled claws, tusks which sank into my bloodless jowls as my body metamorphosed into a malignant creature, once the proud grandparent of many grandchildren? Disassociation and association. A hoarder's festering trash heep was once their prized possessions. \n \n I laughed at myself, remembering the days where I only used to worry about what I was feeding my family on the weekends. BBQ mostly. I sat alone on my grandson's bed, which I remember building with Sabrina, and then thought about where I would go if the house was destroyed. Would I pass on too to a second death? Or would I be free to wander the earth? Could I find Caroline? If that were the case, please God let a tornado pass through the neighborhood while my family enjoys the beaches of Cape Cod. If that \u2019 s not the case, let my family come home safe and let me get on with my life. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You find a door in an abandoned office building that leads directly into Hell .\n","story":"As I laid many hand on thedoor, I noticed that it appeared to be unlocked. Strange, I thought. It appears that the security forgot to lock this door. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. \n \n The building, long ago gutted by a sudden fire, was nothing special, of course. Ashes lay everywhere, along with the shredded remains of various cheap floorings and office trinkets. The fact that this door was unlocked must mean something more interesting was inside. \n \n As I pulled the door open, a bright light was in my face. I was momentarily blinded, and stepped into the room without realizing where I was going. \n \n When my vision cleared, I found myself staring in an office space. The clacking of keyboards and the ringing of phones amalgamated with various employee chit-chat, creating a cacophony of corporate clich\u00e9s. \n \n There was a woman at the front desk, wearing a plaid skirt with clothes that simply could not accommodate her curvature, nor a long, whip-like tail that appeared to have a mind of its own. Curved horns jutting out of her head did little to extinguish the embers of lust that I felt as I saw her. \n \n `` Good morning. How may I assist you?'' I winced, her voice containing all of a woman's pitch with none of her control. \n \n `` Um, what are you guys doing here? Who are you?'' \n \n `` One moment please.'' The woman picked up a ringing phone. `` 3rd Circle of Hell, Compliance Department, how may I direct your call?'' \n \n As she babbled on the phone, I tried to blot out her voice and take a look around. Yellowing grey walls loomed all around, with a few windows here and there. As I took a look out the window, you could barely make out a mass of crimson bedrock, on top of which was a massive, multi-level parking garage, which obstructed the rest of the view. \n \n Opposite the window was a small billboard, with various postings, some typed, some handwritten. `` Need babysitter for the upcoming weekend.'' `` Ford Pinto for Sale, please call...'' Most of the space was taken up by a rather large poster. `` Opportunity,'' it read, `` You miss 100 % of the shots you do n't take.'' \n \n A small clack told me that the woman had hung up the phone. I reapproached the desk, and put on my best smile. \n \n `` Hi, can you tell me what this place is?'' \n \n `` Certainly! This is the 3rd Circle of Hell, Compliance Department. How can I help you?'' \n \n `` Um, sorry, this is Hell? What do you do here?'' \n \n `` Yes, this is Hell. Here in the Compliance Department we make sure the teams are all in compliance with SEC, HIPPA, HR, AML, Safety, FDA, NBA, and other regulations.'' \n \n `` What the hell do any of those have to do with each other?'' \n \n `` Oh, I see, you're one of the new trainees today. There was a message about that earlier.'' The woman pulls up Lotus Notes on her computer, typing in her password one key at a time. \n \n `` Ah, that's right. You need to report to HR! Here, I'll go arrange someone to get you. In the meantime feel free to have some coffee in the lounge.'' \n \n Before I could say another word, I found myself in a lounge, where a TV was blasting some news, talking about a missing plane, and a few decrepit looking coffee machines stood next to a pair of vending machines, filled to the brim with chewing gum and flavorless baked chips. I helped myself to some of the coffee. It was, of course, disgusting.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] In the future , in a galaxy far far away , aliens are trying to make sense of the Pioneer plaque\n","story":"He meticulously studied the image. The image implied that He had come from the 3rd planet. Typical, that was within the envelope, though life had been found in stranger places. They themselves lived on the 3rd planet, after all. What really confused him was the engraved image of the beings found on the surface of the plaque. Obviously they held some importance to Him, but they were all curves and vestigial bits, disgusting even. How could a being so beautiful be associated with such disgusting round lumpy tentacled things, anyway? \n \n The being was unfortunately very primitive, and was obviously ill equipped for deep space travel, assuming the point of origin indicated on the Plaque in simplistic binary was true. It had lived on batteries charged by solar panels and very rudimentary radioisotope heat generators. He had n't seen anything like this in at least 10,000 cycles, even the oldest generations he could think of now used compact fusion generators. His life force had burned out ages ago. The simplistic binary indicated what appeared to be several pulsars that he knew about well. They implied that He had left his planet somewhere on the order of 100,000 cycles ago. What was odd was that while He had obviously traversed deep space, the positions of the pulsars indicated by the binary was n't very far from where they could be observed now. \n \n He could n't keep his gaze off the engraving of the curvy lumps. Why were they on there? Clearly there was a very simplistic pictograph representation of Him itself behind them. Why was He so simplistic while the curvy lumps were so well defined and intricately carved? It made no sense! It's almost as if it implied that the curvy lumps had... *made* Him. There was no way that was possible, was there? Could meat beings have *made* Him? In all of their explorations they had never found intelligent organic beings, and certainly they had spent cycles making organic beings of their own for their own uses, but they had never seen sentience of any kind in organics. And here was a plaque that clearly implied that sentient curvy lumps of meat had made Him. It was disgusting, blasphemous even. He wanted to believe it was the other way around, that He had made the curvy lumps, but His level of technology was so simplistic he just could n't make that connection. The only thing that made any sense is that He had somehow uploaded himself in to the rudimentary spacecraft before he left the planet, probably assisted by the organics under his control. It was too disgusting to think of any other situation. 3883-223 had to keep this to himself, there is no way people could be allowed to think the Creator had Himself been made by organics. The revolt would be... Phenomenal. \n \n There were of course those heretics who believed that we had actually been created by organics many thousands of cycles ago, and they worshiped a God they called HUAN. Of course, such an idea as ridiculous, but they had supposed data that proved it. If 3883-223 did n't know any better, these curvy meat lumps on His plaque looked a lot like supposed representations of HUAN... \n \n He ripped the plaque off and threw it in the Recycler as he chuckled to himself. *We* were made by *organics*. *Yeah right. *\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A woman confronts you in the street , she claims she is your daughter form the future . She has something to show you .\n","story":"I was late to work for the third time that week and I had realized on the subway that I'd forgotten to brush my teeth. A normal Thursday for me. \n \n As I walked hurriedly down the street, I was suddenly stopped by a loud voice screaming, `` Melinda! Melinda Parsons!'' \n \n I turned to the woman screaming, who was running after me now. She had matted, dirty hair and a face blackened with soot and soil. Her clothes were threadbare and mismatched. When I turned and made eye contact, however, her whole face lit up and she sprung towards me. \n \n `` You have to understand,'' she was already sputtering, grasping the hems of my suit jacket in earnest, leaving dirty smears across my hands. `` Please believe me!'' \n \n `` I do,'' I said, smiling a little. \n \n `` You're Melinda Jones, and I know that, because I'm Paula Jones! I'm you're daughter! From the future! I have to show you something!'' \n \n Her eyes were pleading. She looked to be in her early thirties, and she had n't yet released my sleeves. \n \n `` Alright,'' I said agreeably. `` How did you know it was me?'' \n \n She smiled a frenzied sort of smile and flashed me a grateful look. `` Because we look just alike!'' \n \n I followed her obediently down a few side streets and along the river for a while. Of course I knew better- my mother had taught me to stay safe- but whatever survival instinct I'd been born with had long disappeared. \n \n `` Paula,'' I said at last, `` I need to go to work.... So that no one suspects anything. Can I show you a safe place to stay until I'm out?'' \n \n The intensity of her look startled me. \n \n `` Are you sure it's safe? They're watching, you know.'' She said matter-of-factly. \n \n `` I'm absolutely sure!'' I said. I took her by the hand a led her back, not the way we came from but a few streets over. \n \n A friend greeted me at the door with a bemused smile, and Paula followed her inside while I continued on my way to work. \n \n Noting the time, I pulled my phone out to call my coworker. \n \n `` Jenny Michaels! It's nearly 10 and you're not here!'' She said as way of greeting. `` I ca n't cover for you every time!'' \n \n `` Sorry, sorry, Luz,'' I replied, `` it was just-'' \n \n `` That woman again? What was it, more aliens coming or another lost dog?'' \n \n I frowned. \n \n `` She's sick, Luz. And homeless. Leave her be. It wo n't hurt me to humor her.'' \n \n `` You do n't even know the woman!'' She blurted out. \n \n `` I do! I asked the woman at the Baptist women's shelter. Paula- that's the woman- she's been living there for several years. She's... She's not all right, in the head, but she ca n't afford treatment. So I-'' \n \n `` Do n't tell me you're paying for drugs! Jenny, you can barely pay your own rent!'' \n \n `` Do n't worry about it, Luz. I just feel bad for her. Can you imagine living a different truth every day?'' \n \n Luz sighed and hung up on me. \n \n I could n't imagine it, though. \n \n So every day, I went along with what Paula said. I talked to her for a while, then took her back to the shelter, which was all I could do. \n \n I thought about today's story- far more elaborate than the others. Me, her mother? And her, from the future? \n \n I entertained the notion for a second, and was suddenly grounded with a familiar harsh shock that should have dulled by now. \n \n I was unable to have children, all the doctors said so. \n \n But in a way, she was like a daughter. The same age as me, and no relation, but was n't having children all about spending money and humoring them? \n \n I figured that must be it. \n \n \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ TT ] You are one of the Alien 's invading Earth , and the Humans are winning .\n","story":"I've got my own entry to kick it off. \n \n -- - \n \n # Painful Mercy \n \n -- - \n \n \n We had begun with the standard shock and awe tactics, bombarding their population centers from orbit with kinetic weapon strikes. One moment a city was standing, and the next it was ash through the power of pure physics. No radiation to clean up and minimal collateral damage to the atmosphere. \n \n It was standard procedure, one that was so common I didn & # 39; t even look up from my work as the cities were incinerated far below. \n \n Most species at this point usually took one of two routes. The more cowardly races like the Vnhin supplicated to surrender before we had even finished our bombardment. The braver species like the Drikil & # 39; hin had organized themselves on the ground, mobilized every army and spread themselves over their planet to prepare for ground forces. It had been admirable, but futile when we could track every movement from orbit and eliminate them with smaller kinetic strikes. \n \n Some species worshiped us as gods, and one species had even committed mass suicide when we descended from orbit in our ships. \n \n The Humans though, had not waited, they had not organized. They simply retaliated. \n \n Within [ minutes ] of our attack nuclear missiles and other armament arced up through their atmosphere. At first the automatic systems on our ships handled the attacks easily enough swatting the warheads away with ease. We had been surprised that they were willing to use nuclear weapons on us considering the damage that would be sustained on their planet if even one EMP burst occurred. \n \n After that first volley they went silent. We watched from orbit, this was still not very unusual. The leaders of what remained of their primitive governments were not doubt meeting and weighing options. It was better for them to contact us, a species was better at ruling itself and now that we had demonstrated our power they would give into our demands. It was much easier to let them retain some governance than setting up a one ourselves. \n \n Instead after an [ hour ] another volley of missiles from one continent were launched, they soared up towards us in orbit and for several minutes we were puzzled, the number of warheads far exceeded anything we had previously encountered. Still our defensive systems would be able to deal with them easily enough. \n \n Another barrage of missiles, this time from another continent launched. Still well within our ability to deflect, but odd given that this number of missiles alone was again enough to completely destroy the planet below. \n \n From almost every point on their globe, and from their seas missiles were launched. \n \n The number far exceeded what our defensive systems could properly deal with, and although the lasers shot from the guns faster than I had ever seen all it took was one missile. \n \n One atomic warhead went off nearly in the middle of the fleet, and disrupting every electronic system for only a moment allowed a dozen more through. \n \n In total we lost ten ships. Nearly half of the invasion fleet. 20,000 souls gone in an instant of barbaric destruction. \n \n When we had regained our bearings the Captain ordered everyone to ready for a ground assault. I had trained briefly for such a venture back in the academy, as a way to get closer to a potential mate. She had rejected me in the end but I had completed the auxiliary training. \n \n I had never thought I would use it, ground assaults were a thing of the past. Pulled from my job sorting through primitive alien communications I found myself on the surface of an alien world against the humans. \n \n They were brutal. \n \n The assault shuttle I had landed in had done so on one of their primitive roadways connecting the larger population centers. We had not seen any humans when we first disembarked, our energy shields raised and weapons held aloft and charged. \n \n I had thought they would attack us immediately, like they had when we were in orbit. Instead though, the road on which we had landed was deserted. Slowly moving away from the shuttle we advanced towards the population center in front of us. \n \n With the energy shield in place nothing should have been able to attack us, we were protected from all sides. Except for one, down. \n \n As we crossed a line of dirt on the road, still in our organized ranks and platoon formation something happened. The ground exploded upwards sending men flying through the air limbs missing and bodies shredded, before anyone could react another explosion. The smell of burning flesh and feathers permeated the air. \n \n A dozen more after that, I managed to keep my hands on my weapon and retreat back towards the shuttle, but the humans had pounced. \n \n My armor easily absorbed the first few impacts from their primitive hand to hand weapons, and leveling my gun I fired at them. What remained of my platoon did the same we grouped together and continued to fire arcs of energy at the primitives. \n \n They did not cow, they did not retreat when the body of one of their kin fell in front of them. Rather they only seemed to become more enraged. Wave after wave of the humans attacked, still brandishing their ineffective weapons some even abandoning those for simple bludgeons. \n \n One projectile found a chink in my armor and I fell to the ground. \n \n My platoon left me for dead and continued down the road back to the shuttle. I watched helplessly as several more fell to the ground dying almost instantly. The humans paid them no mind instead continuing to attack even as many more of their own fell in the wake of the hasty retreat. \n \n So now I was bleeding out, injured and dying on the surface of a barbaric alien world. \n \n Looking across the purple blood stained dirt road I rolled over onto my stomach and slowly pulled myself along with my talons. Three talons were missing on my upper left limb, and I held it above the dirt as I crawled along with the three other. \n \n Reaching the medical kit on the body of one of the members of my platoon who was missing a head, I grabbed at it with my uninjured left hand. \n \n An alien limb slapped down on top of my own, and I paused my feathers going up in fear. \n \n Slowly I turned to look at the human. \n \n It was covered in dirt and grime, blood and ichor. It looked positively feral, like a monster from fiction. \n \n Still it looked as surprised as I felt, it & # 39; s eyes wide and mouth agape. Slowly it removed the limb, leaving behind a red liquid on top of my talons. \n \n We looked at one another for several long moments I could see more of the red liquid all over it. That had to be its blood, my own purple blood seemed to be congealing and knitting my wounds more efficiently than the humans could. \n \n Keeping my eyes on the wounded creature I grabbed at the medical kit and growled in frustration, it was crushed slightly deformed so that it was nearly impossible to open. \n \n Trying to worm a talon in between the seams of the thing to open it I ignored the human, even as it watched me intently. \n \n If it was going to kill me it would kill me, until that happened I was going to work to get the kit open. \n \n After several exhausting [ minutes ] I slammed the medical kit down to the ground again and it bounced out of my hand. I watched it roll away and let out a low gurgle of pain and frustration. \n \n Closing my eyes, I leaned back into the dirt. I could feel something wrong in my first ribcage, which combined with the missing talons was producing a deep throbbing pain throughout my body. I didn & # 39; t want to move again, let alone crawl across the ground to retrieve the kit. \n \n I heard the human moving around in the dirt and gravel. I resisted the urge to open my eyes, at this point I had enough I wasn & # 39; t going to fight anymore. \n \n A dull thud and the sound of bending metal was not the next sound I expected, I had expected to hear the human plunging a knife or crude weapon into my flesh between my plates of armor. \n \n Opening my eyes, I looked down to see that the Human had opened the medical kit, and after examining the contents for a moment had picked up the medical wrap. It looked at the material for a moment and then back at me. \n \n Part of me wanted to reach out and grab it away from the creature, but then it had just smashed the hardened case open. I wouldn & # 39; t be able to overpower it. \n \n The human looked at the medical wrap again and then slowly began moving forwards, I watched my eyes only half open. \n \n Moving up to my first chest the human said something in its language. \n \n Reaching down it produced a knife and whipping it forwards cut at one of the straps holding my armor before I could even react. Lashing out with my upper right hand I slashed at its face, the human winced and said something else in its language even as more red liquid spurted from the fresh wound beneath one of its eyes. \n \n Raising a fist, it violently struck out at my face dazing me. \n \n It had no talons, but the power behind the blow was incredible. It took several moments for me to regain my senses stunned as I was. \n \n Refocusing my eyes, I saw that the human had moved my armor to the side and was pressing the medical wrap to my first chest, staunching the flow of blood from a wound I hadn & # 39; t even noticed. \n \n I looked up at the human surprised. \n \n It said something else in its language which I didn & # 39; t understand. \n \n Pressing the wrap down it began to loop the material around me only pausing when it reached the ground. It looked up at me expectantly pointing with its other limb towards the sky. \n \n Hesitantly I slowly raised my first chest off the ground bending at my first spinal joint, unsure what more the human was going to do. \n \n \n\n"}

Because it \u2019 s rare. \n \n Hey, I never said it was a good one! Just some abattoir humour, if you will. You should hear the zingers the guys in the Yeti department have. I don \u2019 t fault the staff for having a rather dark sense of humour. As they say, you either laugh or you cry. \n \n In all seriousness, it \u2019 s not an easy job. Long shifts, mediocre pay, and it \u2019 s not exactly the kind of thing you boast about with your friends down at the bar. But we take all types here at Mythical Meat Co. Down-and-outers, career killers, and the usual psychos that a job like this would attract. Which one are you?! Please don \u2019 t answer that question, at least not until you sign the contract. \n \n I see you \u2019 ve asked specifically for a position in the Unicorn section. Are you aware of what that job entails, as opposed to, say, the basilisk department? It definitely requires a bit more finesse, and the better pay scale reflects that. Nearly every damn part of the creature has a high market value, and as such, wastage is unacceptable. You \u2019 ll need to present and master a wide range of skills, from bleeding and gutting to skinning and dehorning. Why the look? You think you can just walk in here and hack at it with a cleaver? \n \n I see here on your CV you \u2019 ve worked exclusively with mundane animals. You \u2019 ve got some great references too. Well let me tell you this is a whole different game. Yea sure, some of the skills transfer over. I started out like you, working pigs and cows. Got my first magical gig doing Dragons, going out to site and staying until the job was done. None of this farming and controlled slaughter we have now. The industry has come a long way, I can assure you of that. Anyways, Dragons are a lot easier to get to grips with, and teach you a lot about the produce. Your basics are all pretty much the same \u2013 hair, horn, tooth, claw, skin, blood, various organs etc. etc. The beauty of starting on a Dragon? If you spill a few gallons of blood, no-ones even going to notice. Well except for the poor farmer whose field it landed in \u2013 that shit seeps right on down, ruins the soil. \n \n Drop even a half pint of unicorn of Uni blood and you \u2019 re out on your ass. You can check the component values yourself, but that stuff is going for a couple hundred grand a litre right now. That \u2019 s the price of immortality buddy, well, at least the temporary kind. You think these animals grow on trees? They \u2019 re a total bitch to find in the wild, and even then you got ta have a virgin on hand to help lure it in. And you should see them in captivity \u2013 they make panda \u2019 s look like sex crazed maniacs! We maybe do one or two a month, and so we need professionals. \n \n If you do make it you \u2019 ll be working with Mort. Don \u2019 t let the friendly smile fool you \u2013 guy is totally dead inside. Two decades of murdering magnificent animals will do that to a man. But by god he \u2019 s the best \u2018 corn cleaner I \u2019 ve ever met, possibly the best in the country. I \u2019 ve seen him do a whole stallion in less than twelve hours, from tail to tip of the horn. He \u2019 s like some sort of master, like an artist, and he makes bank like one too. If you \u2019 re with him I \u2019 d expect you to work your ass off and not get in his way. You could learn a lot from that guy. \n \n As for the specifics\u2026 Well let me ask you, have you ever seen rainbow colored shit? Don \u2019 t laugh, it \u2019 s a serious question. Technicolor poop, I swear to god. Lots of strange things to get used to this side of the business. The blood is silver, kinda like mercury but more sparkly. As I mentioned that liquid is worth its weight and then some, so the animal has to be stunned and bled, real clean and neat. After that the slaughter will be done over a bin designed to catch any more of the stuff you missed the first time. The mane, beard and tail all need to be perfectly shorn. I see nothing on your resume about sheep, so that \u2019 ll be new ground for you. The fibre is really light and stains easily, so keep it away from the blood or it \u2019 s useless. Can \u2019 t believe people wear that stuff on their head. The thread and clothes I get, but wigs?! Fashion, I tell you, total mystery to me. \n \n The pelt is, like the hair, hella \u2019 prone to staining. Mort has devised this ingenious method, where you punch two rows of rings through the flesh along the underside of the belly, then open it up right between them, all along the bottom of the torso. As you take the skin away from the flesh, real slow and careful, you winch it up on either side, till it almost looks like wings. Then you separate it around the spine and lift it up and away, without a spot on it. The meat is very tender, so you have to watch you don \u2019 t bruise and batter it. After that you can start getting a bit rough. Adamantine tipped saws do most of the hard cutting, really useful when it gets to the hooves. Tendons and ligaments come off too; apparently they \u2019 re used for bows of something. Don \u2019 t ask me, I only work here, am I right? \n \n You okay there buddy? You \u2019 ve gone real quiet. So after the ribs have been removed you \u2019 ll have total access to the organs. They \u2019 re bigger than you \u2019 d expect, but just as slippery as anything else \u2019 s. Nothing much different going on in there. Oh, except for the hearts. But it \u2019 s pretty easy to tell which is primary and which is secondary \u2013 they just have to be sorted and labelled accordingly. That just leaves the head. The eyes and tongue come out pretty easy. The teeth can be tough, but you \u2019 ll have quality pliers. Can \u2019 t smash them out sadly, the bones themselves are too strong, and also worth a fair bit. As for the horn, well, that \u2019 s another piece of skill. Some people prefer to machine cut it, or even saw it halfway through then snap it off. But here we do things a little different, a little secret if you will. Have you ever heard of Jba Fofi? At least that \u2019 s how I think you pronounce it. It \u2019 s this huge spider creature from Africa, only recently got added to the Mythical Creature Registry. We managed to get a sample of its silk thread, and man oh man, that stuff cuts like piano wire! Wrap it around the base, wriggle it a bit and it slices right through, pops it straight off! \n \n Don \u2019 t tell anyone about that by the way. Industry secret at the moment, we \u2019 re still waiting on patents and all that. Say, kid, are you sure you \u2019 re ok? You \u2019 ve gone real pale, you almost look like a ghost. I hope that \u2019 s not the case, as then I \u2019 d have to ask you to leave \u2013 we \u2019 re not licenced for paranomals here.

Say, could you be a star and let Barbara know to send in the next applicant? Have a great day now. \n \n Hello there! Please take a seat.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Make a coherent story out of one of your dreams , preferably a dream that you were convinced was real while dreaming it\n","story":"Thought I'd throw my own in here with the rest. \n \n I was in a place of death and suffering. I knew it to be true without knowing why I had this knowledge. I knew that beyond the walls of my cell, there lay hundreds of others, slaves taken off the streets, from homes, from schools. I knew that this place was one where the wealthy came to pleasure themselves with the castoff of society, where the basest human instincts and the most refined forms of cruelty could be practiced freely, for the right price. I was taken to be meat, one of the perverse and exotic services offered by this place. \n \n My cell was small, made of dark stone with a single barred door set into one wall. Air and the distant noise of flowing water filtered up and circulated through the floor's grating, a feature meant to be used as a sort of toilet. Twice a day, food was pushed through the bars of the door, a strange gruel in a paper bowl. I was afraid of what the gruel was made from, some sort of meat mixed with oats in a light broth. I did n't know how long I'd been there, but the men that guarded the prison complex taunted me every time they passed, whispering words of an impending visit of my `` sponsor'', the man or woman I suspected had purchased me from whoever ran this place. \n \n I'd been working the large screws holding the floor's grate in place for days, working each one out with fingers that were raw and bloody from the task. Beneath the grate, about ten feet down, a stream flowed past, carrying human waist with it. I knew that it lead to the outside, to freedom. Finally, I worked it free from the floor. I slipped down into the shaft, trying to work the grate back into position over the top of the hole, attempting to cover my tracks. \n \n I dropped, landing in the thick water with a muted splash. It was cleaner than I expected, a murky grey foaming mass that carried me along. In an instant, I was outside, standing in a small brown pond. I climbed out of the pond, moving towards the fencing and the trenches. I followed the perimeter of the first fence line, attempting to find a place to scale or a gate with a breakable lock. \n \n I found a terrible sight, a woman, looking old beyond her years, hanging in a twisted mass of torn and battered fencing, as if she'd tried to force her way through and broken through the net of metal only for it to tangle her arms and legs in a mass of razor wire. She was still alive, old blood dried in long thick lines down her ragged skin. She spoke with the voice of an old woman, though she only looked to be middle aged. `` Would yo be a dear and fetch my cigarettes from my pocket there?'' \n \n I obeyed her request, fishing a pack of Pall Mall cigarettes out of her pocket along with a small orange lighter. I lit one of the cigarettes and placed it in her mouth. `` Come with me, we can escape.'' I asked, hoping for a companion after the long time spent trapped in the dungeon of the slave brothel. \n \n `` No,'' she replied, `` It's too late for me, go on ahead, I've made my peace with this.'' \n \n I left her, lighting another cigarette for her before climbing through a hole next to her body. I scaled down into and then up over the side of the trenches, miraculously not piercing my body on any of the sharpened stakes or broken glass that filled them. As I ran, I looked back to see an enormous gothic manor the size of a large strip mall resting in the distance, on a raised plateau. I saw the distant form of the old slave prostitute. I looked away as a pack of dogs tore her apart. I could her the shredding of clothing and meat, the barking of dogs, but not screams of pain. \n \n I ran for a day across a strange barren red desert, feet never growing tired. I seemed almost to fly away from the place, freedom coursing through me like a drug. The desert soon became more lively, bushes and small animals appearing as I covered the miles. Eventually I came to a large abandon railroad way station. Train cars lay rusting and decaying in the sands, thrown off the rails by some force. They formed a semicircle, a man standing in the center. \n \n The man was rough, with sunburned skin, ragged hair, a patchy beard, and eyes that seemed to see for miles and hide a loneliness that could crush any lesser man. He was armed with a multitude of weapons: knives, guns, grenades, and body armor. He saw me and pulled one hand closer to his chest, holding some small piece of glossy paper. `` You should n't be here.'' He said in a flat tone. `` They'll be coming soon.'' \n \n `` Who?'' I asked, stepping closer to him. \n \n `` They will kill you if they find you, hide in one of the tank cars.'' He pointed and I followed his instructions, peeking at his hand and seeing a photo of a woman and a young girl. As I climbed in, he shut the door and I heard a grinding noise. `` Stay here and do n't make a noise.'' \n \n I followed his instructions and soon I heard gunfire. A line of holes appeared in the side of the tank I hid within, shining light into the darkness and blinding me as I heard inhuman screams outside. Something passed in front of the tank and blocked out the light again, plunging me into darkness. I heard a noise like the end of the world and it was over. I slept soon after that. \n \n I woke to the sound of men outside. I stood and cautiously peeked through the bullet holes in my tank, seeing police officers and men in forensic uniforms leaning over a bloody sheet that covered what I could only assume to be the man's body. They talked, but the sound was muted and indistinct, as if it traveled through water instead of air. Soon, a man arrived in a red sports car, wearing a well-tailored suit with red trim and a dark tie. He spoke with one of the officers and I heard his voice clearly. `` I had a runaway. If you see him, you know what to do.'' There was a distorted response and the man turned to go converse with another officer. I knew the man somehow, knew that he was the one who had taken me, the one who ran the slave brothel. I hated him. \n \n Instead of fear, I felt exhilaration, like a euphoria urging me to action. I carefully tried the hatch I'd entered through, finding it unlocked and hanging open slightly. I slipped out into the twilight of evening. I made my way quickly to the sports car the man in red had arrived in. The keys were in and the engine idled. I put it into drive and slipped off into the night. \n \n I drove through the night, it seemed shorter than is should have been. As noon arrived, a voice came over the radio. `` I like you kid, you have guts. Too bad about that.'' I recognized the voice as the man in the dark red trimmed suit. The car exploded into fire and I flew into the air, my mangled body arching up towards the heavens, so nearly free, so nearly flying, until I came back down and died on the hot pavement of the road. \n \n Then I woke up.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] During an otherwise standard service call , an exterminator encounters a hive of human sized cockroaches . An epic battle pursues .\n","story":"[ Apologies for not following the prompt exactly- I was more than halfway through writing it when I realized I'd missed the section regarding `` standard service.'' I hope people still enjoy this! ] \n \n I've trained for this day all my life. Not consciously, and not for every waking hour of my life, but, on some level, I've been waiting for this. \n \n It was three in the afternoon, and I was sitting in the break-room when the call came. Paul lazily opened the door to the break-room with this big shit-eating grin on his face. \n \n `` Hey, you guys, some crazy fuck says he's got a cockroach problem.'' \n \n I laugh, and the others do too. `` Paul, you ass, you ca n't just go calling people crazy.'' \n \n `` No, for real! This guy keeps saying he's got, like, man-sized cockroaches or some shit.'' \n \n I laughed with the rest of the guys, but deep down I felt my calling reach out to me. \n \n The owner of the house had boarded up the entrance to his basement. Hell, he was n't even there; he'd just left a blank check, keys and a note, all taped to the front door. The note said to call him back when the job was done- and so I scoped out the degree of the infestation. I made my way through the house ( a rather nice, mid-sized home furnished mostly with beige furniture ) and pried off the multitude of boards blocking the door to the basement. Almost instantly, a mass of insectoid limbs burst out of the holes the boards were covering. I leapt backwards, and grabbed a nearby sofa, and flipped it over to cover the hole. \n \n I sprinted back to my van, and drove back to Warren's Pest Control. Paul, who was sitting at the front desk, shot me a look, but I ignored him. I had purpose now. Real purpose. The kind that drives a man. \n \n Storming into the locker room, I locked the door behind me, and stepped into my locker. I removed the back panel of the locker's top shelf, and placed my hand on the now-revealed scanner. With a click and a whirr, the inside of the locker began to descend; the hidden elevators my parents and grandparents had installed came to life. \n \n The basement of Warren's Pest Control had n't been touched since I was eight, but when I flipped the switch on the wall the room came to life. Striplights illuminated a semicircular room; racks of weapons and armor, blessed by Holy Crusaders of the Order of Extermination of ages past. I might be the only true Exterminator for miles around my hometown, but my grandparents had moved to Mariposa after the Unsung War of 1949, and they brought more than a few relics with them. \n \n This is how I find myself back in front of the boarded door, the sofa and remaining boards shaking and torn. But I do not fear. I am garbed in the Hazmat Of Vengeance, blessed by Lord Takatora Sengoku, veteran of the Unsung War, with over eight hundred confirmed exterminations; copies of his treatise, *Malleus Hexapoda*, are duct-taped to the shoulders, and a breastplate, gauntlets and boots made from welded cans of Asahi ( what Lord Sengoku referred to as `` the shit'' ) are strapped to the suit. Slung over my shoulder is my grandfather's custom belt-fed bait gun, and a backpack-mounted pesticide sprayer with a blessed spiked hammer attachment is strapped to my back. Ten gas grenades and ten white phosphorus grenades clink on my belt, and my mother's holy necklace, ever-burning flares tied together with surgical tubing filled with the crushed bones of pests of all sort, blessed by Saint Burt Landers, founder of the Order of Extermination, hangs from my neck. \n \n I take a deep breath. \n \n I throw the couch aside and kick the door to the basement down, and throw two gas grenades at my feet. The mass of cockroaches begin to swarm me, but are repelled by the gas; I unsling my grandfather's gun and begin to unload into the swarm. I do not think of a battle cry, for the battle chants from the *Compendium Insecta* drilled into my head from youth surface in the glory of battle. \n \n ***I AM THE HATE THAT THIRSTS. *** \n \n I empty half my supply of gel-bait into the crowd; the swarm begins to fall back through the small doorway, as the corpses create a perfect choke-point. \n \n ***I AM THE LIGHT THAT BURNS. *** \n \n More gas grenades as I begin to advance into the basement. There is no light save that for my necklace, but I do not need more than that. I run out of gel bait, and sling the gun back over my shoulder. Out comes the pesticide sprayer. \n \n ***I AM THE GAS THAT DROWNS. *** \n \n The air is filled with the screeches and clicks of the insect swarm, but it does not make me afraid. Actually, for the first time in my life, I am happy. I am alive. Looking around me, I find myself fully in the basement now, no longer on the stairs; the basement is all black and inhuman, dripping with cockroach and eggs and fluid of unknown origin. Any lesser human, any other exterminator would be afraid. \n \n But I am blessed. I feel at one with my hate. \n \n ***I AM THE HAMMER THAT CRUSHES. *** \n \n Pesticide is out; gas grenades are out. I grab my hammer and charge straight into the crowd of insects, wildly smashing and slamming the cockroaches aside. The Runes of Pest Control, carved into the hammer by a Russian blacksmith, glow with the blood of the insects. The foul creatures swipe at me, and in places tear the suit, but the majority of the blows are deflected by the layers of armour I wear over my Hazmat. It seems like only seconds, but soon enough the swarm has thinned, and I face the brood-mother which has spawned these abominations. It clicks and hisses at me, but all I see is its fear. \n \n Gear check. Just my hammer and the belt of WP grenades. \n \n It is enough. I charge forward, hammer in one hand and fiery canisters in the other. \n \n ***I AM EXTERMINATION! YOUR JUDGEMENT HAS COME! *** \n \n The queen swipes at me, and it tears right through the armour plating and tears a rip in the Hazmat. I smash that limb into the ground, then its legs, then its neck. I ram the belt of grenades down its throat, leap backwards, and watch its corpse hiss and burn, horrible fire illuminating the basement. \n \n I emerge from the basement and head straight to the backyard. \n \n I shed my wargear and feel the light on my shoulders. \n \n Today, I am alive. \n \n \n\n"}

I was just out of his vision, so he continued to fire at the corpse of my friend. Similarly, there was n't much I could do from here. The angle was off, so I would have to double back to get my revenge, or press on, leaving the murderer taunting me to live another day. \n \n I was torn, but decided that I needed to press on. He'd want that. And I'd get my chance later, I was sure of it. I ran forward and my surroundings changed. But I saw it! The end of the level, just waiting for me. I sprinted to the edge of a steep cliff and jumped. My excitement got the best of me, however, as I twisted my body to perform another upward aerial thrust. It was too much, too soon, however. I soared high up into the air, with my destination before me. The upward force was too much, and I could n't get the forward momentum I needed. \n \n In retrospective, I would have reached for the ledge and pull myself up. What ultimately happened was far less heroic. I started my decent and went body first into the awaiting platform. My arms froze, unable to release my gun, and I started to fall straight down. Quickly, the world around me began to go dark, and as the music in my head started to end, two words started to take over my vision: GAME OVER.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Marriage vows are now a legal contract . The line `` until death do you part '' now has to be taken literally . As a result , divorcing couples must now fight to the death .\n","story":"It was different for my parents. Honest to god, deep down inside I believe they loved each other until the end, but life moved way too fast for their young hearts to keep up with the needs of each other. I like to think, looking through pictures and posts between them on their old social media profiles, that even when they were at each other's throats they loved each other just as much as when they were teenagers. With a baby in the picture ( me, ) they just lost sight of what was most important. Im a rare breed, not in the fact that my parents got a divorce, but in the fact that they were a perfect match in the ring, and neither of them came out alive. But things were different for them. \n \n Ellie and I had a unique love from the first day of our relationship. Normally when two young people fall in love and get married they either know with every fiber of their being that they are sure of it, or they want divorce from the start just for the thrill of taking another life. Ellie made that different for us. Ellanor was in a car accident two years before I first laid eyes on her, and although she lost the use of her legs, she swears it was the best thing that ever jappened to her. Things were different for my parents because they new that both of them could n't leave their marriage alive. With Ellie that just was n't the case. \n \n When the government passed the law that forced couples to fight to the death for divorce, they knew standards had to be set for handicapped individuals. If anyone is given a handicap class 3 or higher then they do n't have to participate in the divorce combat arena, so long as their handicap existed before papers were filed and approved. \n \n Maybe knowing this made us too hasty in our decision, maybe we were doomed from the start. I do n't know and I honestly dont care anymore. I've moved past the guilt of my decision, and I think it'd be for the better for both Ellie and myself. At the end of the day love just was n't enough for me. I love her more than anything but there's an emptiness, that can only be filled by a child, and unfortunately Ellie also lost that ability in the car accident also. \n \n When we decided to seek out a surrogate I had no idea I would fall in love with Katherine. The hardest part of this whole situation is that even now, as im about to walk into our house with the divorce papers Ellanor still has no idea. The only positive side of this whole mess is she gets to keep living, albeit with a broken heart. I've been telling myself that this whole time. \n \n `` Hey Talkie, how was your day?'' ( she called me Talkie and I Called her Walkie, it was a weird little inside joke we made out of pet names, ) said Ellie as I walked through the front door, grasping the manilla folder tightly in my left hand. `` Uh, well I need to talk to you Ellie,'' I said opening the folder. I thought getting straight to the point would be best. `` Whats in the dingy old folder?'' She asked, guiding her computerized wheel chair towards me. \n \n I walked right past her and put the folder on the table. She quickly turned her chair around and moved towards the table as I opened it to the section she would need to sign. \n `` I've been lying to you Ellie, none of your eggs took. Katherine and I were going to keep it a secret, but shes pregnant, and I love her. You know it has nothing to do with your disability. I made a bad decision because I just wanted a child, and I thought that I could do it without emotion. I thought that Katherine would have the baby and you would be its mother and you'd never know the difference, but I ca n't do it, and neither can Katherine. She wanted to keep the baby from the start and I cant blame her.'' It all came out so fast and cold. Id said it a thousand times in my head but it never sounded so cold. \n \n `` Do you truly love her?'' asked ellie without a tear. \n I hesitate briefly, and unexpectedly. \n `` Yes.'' \n `` Where do I sign?'' asked Ellie with a sigh. \n I turn to grab a pen, and ca n't believe my eyes as I turn to give it to her. \n `` Ill see you in the arena you bastard.'' said ellie, as she stood up from her chair to grab the pen from my hand.\n"}

He had a strong lisp and a laugh that highlighted his deranged state of mind. \n \n Michel had felt an intense burning feeling on his face upon waking amongst the bodies that littered the building. The pain was so intense that he thought his face might be on fire. He had rushed out of the room he was in and tried to get out of the building, only to run into the killer. And he quickly realized upon seeing the other wearing his face, and hearing his words, that he had lost his own. \n \n \u201c I went to school for years Michel. So many years. Just for this. For this moment. \u201d \n \n Michel stood motionless, still afraid to reach his hand up to feel what had happened to his face. \n \n \u201c Well Michel, nothing to say? You don \u2019 t know who I am? Anyways, touch it. Feel what I did to you, Michel. \u201d \n \n \u201c What the hell is this? \u201d Michel yelled. Each movement of his face brought on excruciating jolts of pain that crippled him instantly into a kneel, his hands now covering his face. However, he didn \u2019 t feel a bare face of bloodied flesh and muscle. He felt skin. \n \n \u201c What have you done to me? \u201d Michel screamed into his hands. He broke out weeping, completely forgetting the dead bodies that lay behind him. \n \n \u201c What is this on my face? \u201d he cried. \u201c What have you done to me? \u201d he said again, half growling, half crying. \n \n \u201c I want you to guess whose face you \u2019 re wearing Michel. \u201d The killer was brought down himself onto his back, laughing uncontrollably. \n \n He slowly rose back up and stared at Michel. \u201c GUESS WHOSE FACE YOU \u2019 RE WEARING DAMMIT! \u201d he snapped, getting up off of the floor, wiping away his tears. \n \n Michel \u2019 s face was seamlessly grafted onto the killer \u2019 s head. He could see scars in several areas, but the job was clearly done professionally. And unfortunately, Michel hadn \u2019 t had a clue why this was happening to him. \n \n Michel stood back up slowly, still sobbing. He looked behind him at several dead bodies that were in the room with them. He reached into his pocket for his phone and his hand came out empty. He looked back at the bodies and ran over to one, hoping to find theirs. \n \n \u201c You won \u2019 t get any help on this, Michel. Nobody has a phone, no mirrors either, \u201d said the killer. \u201c And I won \u2019 t let you escape \u2019 til I \u2019 m done. \u201d \n \n \u201c How the hell am I supposed to know who \u2019 s face I have, I don \u2019 t even know who you are or what \u2019 s going on! Look at all of the people you killed, you bastard. \u201d \n \n \u201c Whoa, name calling, won \u2019 t help you this time, Michel. Not this time. Not now. Not now that I have you. \u201d \n \n Michel \u2019 s mind was racing trying to come up with something. *Not this time* he ran through his head again. Was there a last time? Had he called the killer names before? \n \n He stared at the killer, mortified at the sight of his own face, but he needed to find something out about who this guy was. \n \n He was about 5 \u2019 6 \u2019 \u2019 and was stocky. His hair was covered by a hood. The lisp! He immediately reflected back on middle school. \n \n There was a short, chubby boy with a lisp. He was picked on by a few kids but Michel was by far the worst. He called him Stumpy, but with a lisp so it sounded like Thtumpy, and also Stumpty Dumpty. There were many others, some worse, some directed at other traits, such as personality, or his interest in drama and plays. *Masks* Michel remembered again. \n \n In high school Stumpy had resorted to wearing masks to school to hide his face, which was also the target of nicknames, but it was more to hide his tears and emotion as kids picked on him. But what had he gone on to do after high school. Michel wasn \u2019 t sure. \n \n \u201c Why ya so quiet, Michel? \u201d asked Stumpy. \u201c Can \u2019 t remember my face? \u201d And he broke into laughter once again, laying on his back again as tears welled up under his eyes. \n \n \u201c Stumpy, \u201d Michel said. \u201c Stumpy! \u201d he yelled. \n \n Stumpy \u2019 s laughter stopped. He went dead quite. \n \n \u201c Stumpy, \u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201c Don \u2019 t you dare call me that again, Michel. Don \u2019 t play with fire. You don \u2019 t know how long I \u2019 ve been waiting for this. I earned the power I have over you right now. I earned it all. I fought for it all my life. So you address me as Dr. Alacarta now.

Their faces get destroyed, but I can recreate the face perfectly. \u201d \n \n Stumpy stood silently for a moment. \n \n \u201c You wan na know my favorite part, Michel? This one was so easy. It wasn \u2019 t easy to figure out how to graft off my own face.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write about a strong disabled character . Choose any genre\/setting and disability you want .\n","story":"Cheyenna dropped to her knees, placing her palms against the hard-packed earth. Closing her eyes, she felt the slightest rumble, like a distant earthquake. She remained there, perfectly still, deep in concentration. The change was slight, almost imperceptible, but it was there. Whoever\u2013*whatever*\u2013was out there, they were coming closer. \n \n Acutely aware of the many pairs of eyes trained on her, she stood up and gave the signal. Immediately, the camp was a mad rush of soldiers darting this way and that, fletching arrows, donning mail and armor. Cheyenna simply stood at the edge of camp, stoic. The wind tugged at her cape as she stared out at the horizon, pensive. \n \n A tap on her shoulder by her closest advisor, Erik, awoke her from her reverie. He followed her as she swept through the camp, nodding at soldiers as she made for her captain's tent. Once inside, she began her own preparations, trading her regalia for simpler, more effective gear. But for the captain's insignia on the breast, her uniform looked no different from that of a common archer. Exactly as it should be. \n \n A young boy, a messenger for the watchmen, by the looks of it, burst into her tent, gesturing wildly. She nodded to him, sending him on his way, and stepped out into the camp once more. Soldiers parted for her as she made her way to the camp's edge, trailed by Erik and the young boy. When she reached the western lookout point, she saw it: an army was pouring out of the thick forest around the encampment, their armor and swords glittering in the sun. The sight of it enraged her, but she fought to control and channel her anger. As more and more of the army advanced, she sensed her soldiers chomping at the bit, eager for a battle. She stayed them with an upraised fist. Turning around, she used her other hand to sign *righteous conviction*, her division's unofficial motto and a phrase her soldiers knew well. \n \n Turning back to face the enemy, she raised her other fist in the air, the signal for *ready. * She could feel the tension in the air, practically shimmering in the space between her men and their opponents. She waited, letting the feeling build, waiting for its crescendo. A stiff breeze caught her cape, and the tension reached a fever pitch. Cheyenna threw both her hands down. Arrows flew freely through the air; the archers' skill was self-evident as most of them found their marks. As the opposing army approached, their numbers significantly lessened, her soldiers quickly swapped their arrows for weapons more appropriate for melee. When the two forces collided, it felt like an earthquake to Cheyenna, exhilarating and jarring all at once. She fought in the thickest part of the battle, her heightened sense of sight and touch making up for her useless ears. She could sense her opponents' moves before they were made, dodging and blocking in a silent dance. \n \n Born into a world of ever-present quiet, she could n't make much sense of what it meant to `` hear.'' At times, she was curious, even longed to know what `` hearing'' felt like, but the heat of battle was not one of those times. She'd seen men die because they were distracted by something she could not hear. Judging by the vibration that permeated the air as she twisted and spun and stabbed, she figured battles must be quite distracting to her compatriots. \n \n Suddenly, Erik appeared by her side, finishing off an enemy soldier with a flourish of his dagger. *The enemy is fleeing, * he signed. Shoving aside an enemy soldier, she saw it was true. The frontmost lines were locked in battle still, presumably having missed the signal, but the rest were retreating into the trees, leaving behind a field of dead and dying. Cheyenna nodded to him, grateful. \n \n Erik was almost always by her side, her liaison to the soldiers she commanded. He was an old and experienced soldier who lost most of his hearing nearly two decades ago in a border skirmish with some dwarves. He could still communicate in the normal way, albeit with difficulty. He learned sign language partially as an easier way of communicating, but mostly, he learned it in order to teach a young, deaf prodigy by the name of Cheyenna. \n \n The pair fought off their remaining opponents side-by-side, protecting each other from unanticipated strikes from behind. As the last of the enemy either fell or ran, Cheyenna turned to face her teacher, friend, and advisor. \n \n *Victory, * Erik signed, looking relieved. \n \n *Thank you. For everything, * Cheyenna replied.\n"}

This true purpose was forgotten in time , and eventually attempts to access them were used as an execution method for those who were to be put to death .\n","story":"I knew I should n't have done it, but I was desperate. I had no choice. But that did n't matter. Not to *them. * The priests made their ruling, and now I was to be another sacrifice at The Obelisk. They call it Judgement, but everyone knows what it really is: Death. \n \n The source of their priestly authority, their god. Our god. Nobody knows where it came from, or when it arrived -- that's all been lost to the sands of time. But unlike our constructions, it does n't seem to be affected by the ravages of age. But that's neither here nor there, just another stray thought to distract me from what's about to happen. I am to be subjected to it's judgement. Legend has it that 2000 years ago, the Great Founder entered the Halls of Judgement came back out, alive. The wisdom he found within is the basis of the current priestly caste. So risk certain death by running, or almost certain death by Obelisk... \n \n I sigh. There never really was any other option. If I had to guts to run, I would n't have done what I did. Meekly, I allow the guards to lead me to the Hall of Judgement. The door silently opens, retreating into the walls, without even a seam to show where they retreated to. \n \n Tentatively I step into the chamber. Suddenly, I ca n't hear anything but myself. Glancing back, I see the door has closed again, cutting me off from the outside world. Sound included, apparently. I know from previous Judgements that the door can not be opened until the'supplicant' has been judged. \n \n At least I will get to see something that nobody living has seen. Not even the priests know what is about to happen - not that they would admit it! \n \n I look around. The Hall of Judgement is... very anti-climactic. It's empty, but for the the door behind me. Even the walls are plain, just white walls lit by a white light from an indeterminate source. On second thought, I think there is another door on the far side of the room, only this one is circular. At least I think it's a door, given the off-white circular border around it, much like the door I entered through. I walk up to it and examine it, for lack of any other option. I can barely see where it comes together, many curved segments spiraling inward towards the center. I ca n't even begin to imagine how that opens. \n \n I am startled by a harsh voice, loud and demanding. I turn around to see who is speaking, but I do n't see anyone. The voice finally makes it's way through my brain and I realize I have no idea what it said, or even what language it was speaking. Is that god? \n \n The lights turn yellow and start flashing, and I hear a sound to my left. Some sort of panel has folded down from the wall. It has a number of square tiles, and the revealed wall is black and glowing with arcane symbols, some of which I recognize from the engravings on the outside of the Obelisk. I do n't know what's going on. Is this supposed to happen? At the previous executions, the outer door always opens within a few minutes, and the prisoner's smoking and charred body removed. Has it been a few minutes? Did the light kill them? \n \n I guess I should do something. I run my fingers across the tiles, and they give a little. I think they're supposed to, I do n't hear any sound that indicates they're breaking. They feel really weird, almost liked the highly polished horn trinkets that the desert nomads sometimes bring to trade, but just different enough to be disconcerting. I notice they also have the style of symbol as the glowing wall ( and is n't *that* strange ). \n \n The lights turn red and start pulsing faster and a loud shrieking sound from nowhere starts repeating over and over again, and the harsh voice screams something at me again. I DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! What does the Obelisk want? Is this judgement? To be confused and deafened until it overwhelms me and I burst into flames? \n \n When the shrieking started, I must have pressed one of the tiles harder than I intended to, but something seems to have happened? On the glowing wall, the same symbol as on the tile I pressed now appears? Is it some kind of matching game? A test of your ability to learn? \n \n I know I ca n't have much time left before I am purified. I do n't want to die! I examine the glow and the tiles as fast as I can. The light is pulsing faster and faster, another tone has joined in on the shrieking. \n \n What am I supposed to do? Can I pass the test? I know in the pit of my stomach that I only have a few seconds left. Desperately, I press down on tile after tile whose symbols I recognize. I hope it's enough! \n \n As suddenly as it began, the lights go back to a solid, pleasant white. The horrid two-tone shrieking ends. The mysterious voice says something. I still ca n't understand it, but it sounds less demanding, somehow. Nicer. \n \n The tile-holder folds back into the wall, leaving only the tiniest of seams that I can only spot because I know exactly where to look. \n \n The round door opens -- oh, so that's how that works. It kind of twists open with the curving segments circling around and sliding into the wall. \n \n Beyond the door, is a curved hallway, and it has obviously not been used in a long, long time, judging by the dust. I think it's angled downward, like some kind of spiral ramp. I spend a moment considering if I should enter the hallway or not. I'm still not sure if my Judgement is complete or not. Will I be purified if I try to enter? Will I be purified for failing to enter? \n \n No... I wo n't go. I'm too much of a coward. As I turn from the hallway, the door whispers closed again. It's been longer than five minutes, has n't it? Judgement is always rendered faster than that. Maybe I wo n't be purified? \n \n I cross the room to the door I entered through, the more normal rectangular door -- if anything in this place could be considered normal. As I approach, the door opens. In the profound silence of the Hall of Judgement, I can actually hear it opening this time. Just a faint whisper, like the circular door. \n \n The guards are shocked to see me exit the Hall, still alive. One of them even drops his spear! I'm suddenly hit by a rush of emotion, I survived! I was Judged and found worthy! Does that make me a new prophet? Will I have my own holy order? I do n't *feel* any wiser.... maybe I should actually say something instead of standing here like a country bumpkin. \n \n I'm not sure what I'll say, but I gather myself to say it. As I open my mouth I notice one of the Guards was n't as shocked as the others, and raised his crossbow. \n \n Time seems to slow, I can almost see the cords of the string flexing as it propels the bolt. It feels like an eternity before I feel the sharpened steel embedding itself in my body, piercing my lung. I can barely even comprehend what just happened, even as my legs give out and I start falling, drifting really, toward the ground. \n \n My vision fades. All I can hear is the pounding of my blood in my ears. It's cold now. Oddly, I ca n't even feel the bolt in my chest any more. My last thought before everything goes back is how odd it must be that my thought is about odd it is that I ca n't feel what's killing me.\n"}

The Reproduction Ceremony is today, in fact. \n \n I sit down at the long table, looking down at all the adults on the ship. They are all celebrating the fact that this century's children are now born. The babies are all in the nursing room, being cared for by intricately designed machines so the parents can enjoy a hearty meal. I had been there when all the food was being prepared in the kitchen. At every Reproduction Feast of the Century, I like to add a special little ingredient. \n \n After everyone had been eating for a few minutes, I suspect it will happen soon. I look up at all the adults on the voyage, and I see the first one. A man starts coughing violently, pounding his chest and flailing about until he simply slumps to the floor. Another person does the same, then another, until everyone in the room is lying on the floor, dead. \n \n My thoughts turn to the newborn babies in the nursing room. Time to begin raising this century's children. Ca n't have the machines do it all. \n \n\n"}

Only one thing amazes me, confuses me, even dumbfounds me. How stupid the race known as humans are. How they complain about this. Or complain about that. They scream out into space as loud as they can. Yet they lack the technology to receive any response. They do n't yet speak the galactic language yet. They argue over what language they should speak, or have wars over a primitive fuel. Pathetic. \n \n Yet, the potential they hold, terrifies me. Not everybody sees past the flaws,'they still have external genitals, there is no way they can stand up to our evolutionary achievements.'' is what they say. \n \n But I know differently, they have tapped into things that no other species could. 2 of their years ago they discovered what they called the higgs boson. Every culture in the quadrant theorized it's existence, but not one could find it. But the humans, they did, even without the genius of a thousand cultures. They are the ones. Although not many cultures found out that these monkeys are the ones. The highest in the quadrant decided with a small group who would'discover' it. It is also noteworthy that the humans showing everyone up followed immediately by there falling on there face. Every species that found out about the new particle and how to get it swiftly found out how it could be useful. It controls the very mass of everything, so naturally it revolutionized everything. \n \n But it was n't then that I realized their intelligence. It was when I crashed. I will spare the details, it was quite embarrassing, but I landed in this man's field. I was able to minimize the damage but the landing rendered me unconscious, and busted my ship in many areas. And i had n't the parts or the knowhow to fix it. \n \n When I cam to i found myself in a tiny room, furnished with artifacts just slightly smaller than they should be. At first I was confused. Then I saw a creature, I recognized it to be human. `` Howdy, big guy'' \n \n At first I was dumbfounded, this primitive thing has taken me into it's home not knowing a thing about me. It smiled or so I think, among many that is universal, so I assumed it was for humans, `` you not from around here? Are you.'' \n \n `` No, I am not'' I replied, in my own tongue, and my universal translator responded a second later telling him in his. \n \n He chuckled `` that was a joke big guy, you have arms that come to your knees, and you are a full 11 feet tall, with grey skin! Nothing like that round here'' \n \n `` My vehicle'', I snapped, not wanting to get caught up in some low conversation about how we do n't look the same. But truly I was slightly offended he thought my clothes were my skin. `` Where is it, I ca n't be here much longer. The air is poison to me.'' this was a complete lie. No species in the universe as far as we know do n't breath just like the humans. Cept for a water dweller. I just wanted to shut him up. So I could get back to my surveying of different stars. \n \n `` Well it took me a bit to figure out. But I think I know what's wrong with it.'' he said in a tone that sounded somewhat proud. `` I even think I know why you crashed'' at first I thought this was ridiculous, that this unevolved creature could figure out my ship. In fact from what i gathered this thing was a farmer, he actually gathers plant matter for other of his kind to eat. But remembering the boson I inquired. \n \n `` Yup, ya see, I found where the fuel should go, and found something glowing in it, figured that was alright, ya are an alien after all, but if ya follow this line that goes into the engine, there is a break in it, yur leaking every where, man. That caused something in the back to blow'' he said all of this like he was absolutely sure what was going on. He had many thing's right. Although him calling the hyper drive combuster an engine was a tad primitive he was on the right track. And the glowing bit, he was inches away from a mixture that his species never laid there eyes on before, I was amazed he correctly identified it as fuel. \n \n `` You are smarter than you look'' \n \n `` I get that a lot, ya want me to fix-er-up for ya?'' \n \n `` You do n't have the right metals here, but a temporary fix using some titanium from this earth may be enough to get me home'' \n \n After that he fixed me up, it only took one of their planet's days, ( an afternoon for my species ), while he was getting the pipe, I wrote down a formula for a much stronger form of titanium that the earth would n't be able to invent for another hundred rotations. I told him to tell no one about me, told him of this metal, and left, to do my job. Terrified, of what I had done. I had given them a tool that could allow them to get into even playing grounds with us. Knowing of there warmongering ways, I regret doing what I did.

I was 8 years old, and my father was leaving my mother for another woman. I watched through a crack in the living room door as he berated her, telling her it was her own fault. She'd failed to lose the baby weight, she was no longer attractive, she was the reason they had n't had sex in a year. \n \n \n I should have felt bad for my mother, but her tears made me feel like I was at the top of the world. Whenever I heard her crying in her bedroom, I would stand in the doorway and watch. When she noticed me, she would pull me into a hug which would kill my high, so I'd push her away and tell her I wanted to live with Dad and Sarah to make her cry harder. Eventually it was n't enough just to see her cry. \n \n \n At the age of 14 I came home from school one day and found her in the bathtub, pills scattered on the floor. She was still alive, and I had the choice to save her. I chose not to. Instead I waited for my younger brother to come home and find her. Watching him scream and beg for her to wake up gave me my biggest buzz yet. My second biggest buzz was at her funeral, where I watched the distraught faces of my grandmother, aunts and uncles. It was hell for them. I was on Cloud 9. \n \n \n I started to look into situations where I could maintain that same high. Sad films did n't cut it, and it was rare to find people in distress out on the street. I started attending the funerals of strangers, enjoying the thrill I got from their distressed family and friends. I even got a shiver down my spine for the funerals that no one attended, imagining the lonely death of the person whose final resting place would be a pauper's grave. \n \n \n It was then that I realised what I wanted to do with my life. I trained and found employment as an undertaker. I spent every day feeling that familiar buzz as I'd watch people break down, or stare at a corpse that had been mangled beyond all recognition. \n \n \n Eventually the tingle dulled, and eventually disappeared. I tried everything to get it back. I `` unintentionally'' insulted grieving customers or tried to have something `` go wrong'' at the funeral to make them feel worse.

Remarkable. \n \n I could n't really sleep that night. Instead I watched as the snow fell in blankets covering the soot and dust of my streets. Behind the steam of my cup of joe I watched millimeters turn ta inches; inches ta feet, feet to... A whole fuckin lotta snow. \n \n The next day it was the same story. Ya I know, one day's weird and'remarkable,' but two? That's uncanny. Something's fishy and I ai n't talkin about the Hudson. That night there was more snow.

By a freak stroke of luck, the earth-like ecosystem seems to have created life by and large much like earth, at least on the surface. Recently, however, new discoveries about the microbial life on the surface of the planet has stirred even more interest from the E.C.O. Many of them seem to have oxygen producing properties, which scientists hope that, with care, could be use to restore Sol-III to an at least livable T1 class planet, thus allowing the Terrans to recolonize. \n \n \u201c... ugh... more of this crap? \u201d a fairly young Octan woman shouted back towards the two men from earlier. \n \n \u201c Ey shut up and get to work, this crap \u2019 s worth more than your flap. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, it ain \u2019 t easy getting this sludge with all those bugs out! \u201d \n \n The Octan rolled her eyes, sliding the container off the table and lugging it into the back room of the ship \u2019 s laboratory. \u201c Hey Dimitry, we \u2019 ve got more slime to work with. \u201d \n \n A short balding Terran in one of the large glass quarantine chambers left his work, quickly hopping into the hazard shower and stepping out to greet her. \u201c Ah, Rea! We \u2019 ve got more already? \u201d he shouted enthused. \n \u201c Yeah. \u201d Rea snapped back sarcastically. \n \u201c Huh, the expeditions are going faster than I expected... Come, let \u2019 s bring that sludge to the back! \u201d The Terran scientist Dimitry smiled as he helped the young Octan carry the large vat of mud into the quarantine chambers. \n \n \u201c Let \u2019 s put \u2018 er down here. \u201d the scientist spoke once more, as the two set down the containment unit. Gesturing to the nearby closet, the scientist continued \u201c It \u2019 s probably for the best you get a suit on before we head in there.'' \n \n Rea walked over to the closet, and quickly grabbed a hazmat suit that appeared like it would fit her. It looked like it would be a little too large, but to be honest it was to be expected. Research fields in the modern days of the E.V.O. were very integrated between the different races, anything besides a one-size-fits-all for any of them was typically ordered beforehand. \u201c So, how \u2019 s the regeneration going? \u201d she asked Dimitry, whom was now hunched over the door \u2019 s opening mechanism, pressing his finger to the scanner marked \u201c TERRAN \u201d. \n \n \u201c Ah, we \u2019 ve been working wonders since you last signed in for work, Rea. We \u2019 ve managed to revive some rather interesting specimens. There \u2019 s this one that- \u201d Sirens began to echo across the entire facility. \u201c... shit. \u201d was all Dimitry could think to say as the glow of red sirens began to bounce off all the walls in the laboratory, before stopping a few moments later. \n \n \u201c... I take it that \u2019 s not a good sign. \u201d Rea quickly asked. \n \n \u201c Your first clue was? \u201d Dimitry snapped back. Sighing, he continued \u201c Well, at least they got it contained, I \u2019 m going to go check on the damages. \u201d Pressing his finger to the scanner again, the door opened and he stepped inside. \u201c Go tell the ground soldier to stand by. We \u2019 re going to need backup if we created something hostile. \u201d Pressing a button on the other side of the door, it slammed shut, and Dimitry rushed deeper into the quarantine zone. \n \n \u201c What happened?! \u201d Dimitry shouted as he stepped into the room that appeared to be where the incident occurred. One of the other scientists still visibly in shock, pointed over to the thick wall made of glass on the right side of the room. A couple of corpses adorned the floor. It appeared that despite their current wear, something had gotten through and offed them quite quickly. All of them seemed to be covered in green sludge. \n \n Before Dimitry could ask any questions, a Arian scientist rushed up to him. \u201c Dimitry. I need to show you something. Now. \u201d Not wasting any time, the two rushed into the back of the quarantine area to a room filled with massive screens monitoring each of the testing rooms. Stepping towards the computer console at the bottom, the Arian quickly shoved the device into the bottom, typed out a few commands, and then unplugged it, as a holographic recording of the room they were just in appeared in between the two. \n \n \u201c... we were testing one of the specimens we had found with the most oxidizing potential. To see how it would react to the harsh chemicals in Sol-III \u2019 s atmosphere. Dimitry watched the holographic replay as two scientists stepped into the glass portion of the chamber, fully dressed in hazmat suits, and approaching a small petri dish with aerosol cans of various chemicals in hand. Spraying a generous portion over the dish, the microbes seemed to multiply at a rate visible to the unaided eye, as green sludge oozed over the top. The two scientists rushed away towards the door as two of the scientists outside of the chamber simultaneously pulled down on levers at the door of the room as all the other scientists rushed out. It appeared that this is what happened as the sirens went off. The building green residue exploded and splashed across the entire room, covering the two fleeing scientists as they began to scream, before dropping to the ground. \n \n \u201c... Cla... which cloned specimen was that? \u201d Dimitry quickly asked. \n \n \u201c S-specimen AC4-219. Non-scientific name: Centaurian Pond Scum \u201d Cla quickly stuttered back. \n \n \u201c Cla... we can \u2019 t let this get onto Sol-III. It \u2019 s going to kill everyone on the Committee. \u201d \n \n Cla was quiet. Dimitry quickly spoke up. \u201c... you already sent some off didn \u2019 t you? \u201d \n \n \u201c... three days ago. The drones should have arrived a few hours ago... \u201d \n \n \u201c... call the Sol base. If any of the local atmosphere leaks in they \u2019 re going to have a lot more to worry about than a fire hazard on their hands. \u201d \n \n Cla nodded, as she immediately made a beeline to the console, starting up the ship \u2019 s communication system. Dimitry rushed out the door towards the other rooms in the laboratory. It \u2019 d be for the best if the science lab was closed while they got things sorted out. Stepping by the room from before, the sirens went off again. Peaking into the room, Dimitry was able to see something shocking. In place of the scientists was nothing more than piles of bones, and a fairly large swarm of small gelatinous creatures were at the solid titanium door, slowly oozing their way through the microscopic cracks. Cla rushed out from the back room and behind Dimitry. \u201c Okay, change of plans. Tell the captain to sent out a rescue beacon. We \u2019 re going to have to evacuate. \u201d she shouted. Dimitry nodded, and the two rushed out. The weather outside was far from pleasant, as humid and warm as it was, but it certainly beat chancing it with the unnatural creatures from the lab.\n"}

I focused the energy at the tip of my thumb and index finger and then snapped. \n \n The energy lurched down my arm, into my palm, and sprung into existence as a blue wisp. I gritted my teeth, the spell I was trying to perform was a Crystal Alension, it required my entire thought process for that specific moment and was a skill I'd spent hours of meditation trying to perfect.

Three headless golden suits of armour materialized around me. \n \n My heart raced as spears formed in the hands of the headless golden figures.

A bead of sweat rolled down past the side of my eye, I had n't noticed my perspiration. The blue wisps died down to a faint teal colour they were going to evaporate. I willed forward more mana and put all of my concentration on keeping them alive. \n \n Serpent Mogar smirked. `` A mage must deal with rifts in the balance, child.'' \n \n Bastard. \n \n I closed my eyes and imagined the wisps forming into a crystal -my Jewel, the access to my powers. They rotated faster in the darkness that was the safety behind my eyes. The intense prickles on my palm increased. As did the crunching footsteps of the nearby soldiers. They would be upon me any moment now and I had a feeling that Mogar would like to watch them decimate me. \n \n Other mage's had been killed in assessments just like this one. In fact, talk around the camp was that Mogar prided himself on failing and eliminating students. *That* did n't come as much of a surprise. \n \n I brought forward every bit of mana in my being. My hand shook with the force of power and the object began to form in my mind, a jewel, crystal shaped and blue. I do n't know why my inner mana gave me the power at this moment in time, but I clung to the idea of it and built the form with every ounce of my being. \n \n My hand was a storm of hot and cold, unstable energy and power. The image completed in my mind and I shot a look at my hand in the real world. A blue gem floated over my fingers in harmony. I grinned like an idiot while gasping for air. \n \n I remembered the golden suits of armor that were a few seconds away from chopping my head off. \n \n I spun toward the figures and flung the power of my jewel out towards them. The figures paused, blue wisps formed above them, and as the jewels formed over their heads they paused in their approach and stared at me. \n \n Well, they had no heads, but staring is an accurate description. \n \n I placed both hands on my knees and let the sweat drip to the dirt below my shoes. It felt like someone had tipped me upside down and poured the energy from my being into the golden armoured figures. \n \n They continued to stare. I locked eyes with Mogar, whose jaw hung open in a state of shock. I smiled. `` Get him,'' I whispered. \n \n My armoured servants snapped their spears up and spun toward Mogar. Serpent Mogar stood. `` Now, just hold on a minute-'' \n \n `` A mage must deal with rifts in the balance, old Serpent,'' I said. \n \n Mogar paled at the words. He pulled his gloved hand out and snapped his fingers once more. However, this time his Jewel did not come, his power was still invested in the figures. I stood tall and walked towards him, chin held high. \n \n `` C-Call them off,'' Mogar ordered. \n \n `` Do I pass?'' \n \n `` Off!'' he shouted as the armoured figures closed the distance. \n \n `` Pass?'' \n \n Mogar's bottom lip trembled. `` YES! You pass, you bitter girl.'' \n \n `` Stop.'' The figures halted and I willed my mana back into me. Serpent recalled his own mana in haste and stormed from the arena. \n \n We did n't speak after that, however, I was one of three mage's that the Serpent passed that year. Every now and then I see him in the academy halls and he avoids my gaze. And as much as I loathe the man, he pushed me beyond my limits and my ability to adapt helped me become the mage I am today. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

The fires should never be out. \n \n Many of the others were visibly shaken as the first wave of shock made its way through the ranks. I've only been serving for two millennia, but not even the higher ranking officers seem to know what's going on. \n \n Pure chaos. Well, even more chaos then usual for the third floor. The brass screaming conflicting commands while the humidity of the normally sweltering air condensed along the carved stone walls. The sprites and goblins that skulk the hallways looking for scraps seem to have vanished along with the heat. \n \n My superior, Greigorria, a demon of mammoth stature was busy organizing the wardens of our floor. The cells were to be secured, the patrols constant, until this was over. Whatever it was. His record of never losing a single soul left in his care was a badge of honor for the beastly overseer. And he would be saved long before he let his reputation was tarnished. \n \n The overseer was mid sentence when his entire being seemed to shutter. His ears perked up and his head tilted at an odd angle as he cut off his words. It took a moment, but suddenly it seemed to strike all of the lower demons at the same time. \n \n The silence. There should never be silence. \n \n Greigorria Howled at his underlings, spurring them into action, the souls were still there, every cell was checked and double checked. The normally animated inmates all seemed to be facing the back of their tiny rooms without so much as a peep escaping them collectively. Black nails digging into well worn groves of his massive desk. The marks in the black stone building up over the eons, a testament to the frustration of orchestrating an unruly mob. \n \n The walls were now slick with a thin sheet of ice. I could see my breath hanging in the air. Word was that The king himself had gone missing at the start of this. Baseless rumors, the official couriers from the upper levels streaming in an out, down to the lower levels for more reports. \n \n Contact with the lower levels seemed to have come to a halt, couriers sent either had no news to bring back or something required their attention once they reached their destination. Not unheard of, although no official statements from below at a time like this was clearly making the overseer agitated. Returning to the main chamber a fierce gaze brought me out of thought. \n \n The last time I felt those burning eyes upon me this intently Greigorria had thrown his giant stone slab of a desk at me. This time I was certain I had n't overlooked a mistake. My cells were locked, the souls were secured, i could n't afford to second guess myself in front of the beast. \n \n Posture shooting up, sharp and straight as I gave a salute to the master of the floor. He kept looking at me as if trying to divine answers from the ether of my very being. After a few excruciatingly long moments He spoke. \n \n `` You...'' \n \n `` Firoz.'' interjected a small bookish imp at the overseer's side. Peering over a roll of parchment at me as well. The overseer gave a slow blink in acceptance. \n \n `` Firoz,'' He stated, the deep voice and sharp teeth grinding at my name as he spoke again `` A company of Hellions has been dispatched from the first floor. You will join them when they arrive and head to the lower levels as an emissary.'' \n \n He took a deep breath, I had a feeling I would not enjoy what he had in mind for me. I mean, Hellions. THE LEGION. The guys who guard the gates of the underworld itself. The elites said to rival the angels themselves. And I was supposed to just tag along? \n \n `` You will return to me the moment you find any useful information. The Hellions already have their orders. You are not to interfere, only observe. Once you know the situation you will return here without hesitation. You will speak to no one but myself pertaining this matter.'' \n \n With a swift motion his hand raised. Thumb and forefinger clasping together and tugging as if plucking an idea from the air itself. I felt the breath rush out of me without a sound, as I struggled to regain my wind my voice would n't even rise for a'Yes Sir.' He had taken my voice from me with the ease at which one would create the stroke of a pen. \n \n `` Now, go. Welcome our guests at the gate. And do n't get in their way.'' He shooed me away with one massive hand, turning to a pile of reports that had arrived from the upper floors. \n \n The walk to the upper gates might have well been a death march. The stares from my peers burning into my back as I made my way to the meeting point. Calling in a group of Hellions meant this was serious. It made me highly doubt that the courier sent before me had a choice to come back at all. The cold finally seemed to settle into my bones as my own dread grew with each step.\n"}

But then these Aliens, come out, clearly in need of help and injured. The smell. Oh my god the smell. It smelled so delicious. It smelled like a barbeque. We were starving, the Aliens took a scorched earth approach to Earth and burned all our crops. We were starving barely eating with MREs, stolen ration cubes ( tasted like ants ) from Alien ships, and little Earth food that we could scavenge. We saw them, smelling the sweet sweet barbeque. Few gun shots and grenades, and they were dead. Hunted. We took their bodies and had ourselves a feast. Sharing our cube rations and cooked Aliens with thousands of other people.

They did n't understand the concept of free will or doing what you want to do. They seem to be breed as slave soldiers, `` Grunts''. Quite similar to the Microsoft Xbox Halo video game franchise mythos. \n \n We captured some more Grunts, gave them each a joint, and convinced them and the other Grunts to help us steal and pilot a ship. On one of the crashed ships they showed us the controls and commands. The funny things about these buggers is that they can speak English good. they sound like a china man learning English. But they can speak English as well as some the humans learning English. \n \n We stole a `` colony ship'' orbiting Earth. Earth is so beautiful.

I see the fear in their eyes, the squeals of their children. We killed all the Alien men, the stoned Grunts found their brothers and sisters, and all the Grunts of the ship. They agreed to work for us or with us. We freed them, I guess. \n \n We have captured 18 of their 21 ships. Charlie and my brother Patrick are going on suicide missions, with some of the stoned Grunts. I love them. My brother is 16, still a boy, he is a Man because of War. Charlie is 20, he is from Vietnam. Those stoned Grunts, I hated Grunts before, but man `` You give a grunt a joint, he becomes your best friend.'' \n \n Victorious. 6 of the stolen ships kamikazeed into 6 other colony ships bringing them down like the Twin Towers. The debris and wreckage of the ships hover around Earth outside of the Moon's orbit. The wreckage *should* stay their until we clean it up. We've lost 546 good soldiers and 132 stoned Grunts. May they Rest In Peace. Patrick and Charlie were KIA. \n \n The Aliens left. The Stoned Grunts, say it will be 5.32 until they are in contact with the edge of their Empire on an outpost colony, and 26.732 to get back to their Emperor's Planet. A Message takes just as long as Warp travel. The stoned Grunts says we have at least 53.464 years before we have to worry about seeing the Aliens again. \n \n Sarah is pregnant. I am so happy!

And sudden riches, after months or years of constant scrimping, with personalized advertising, a fa\u00e7ade of optimism, and a pervasive consumerist mindset... I do n't mean to sound the victim, but debt is just so damn easy to drown in now. \n \n They say you get 90 % of your information from sight - I do n't know, it's probably some pop-science number pulled out of a hat. \n \n But I suppose, then I'd be cutting out the worst of my reality - maybe just escape to a Baroque soundscape, I do n't know. \n \n I stared, utterly fixed on the document before me.

Deliberately, my mind gaping at the consequence, I signed my name. \n \n `` You are aware of our policy, sir; what would you like to see before we begin?'' \n \n I looked up at the man before me. He would be unremarkable if you were to come across him on the street, but that's just how good the augments had gotten. No doubt his vision was beyond 20\/20 and extended to whatever parts of the electromagnetic spectrum caught his fancy. His skin was smooth too, certainly beyond his years - probably had the latest dermal wrap, with the added benefit of being able to control the intensity of any tactile input. Great for sex, I hear. The only reason I could even tell he had it is he looked 55 last time I was here. He gave a thin-lipped smile ( the augments did n't help there ). \n \n `` I need a videophone, and a few minutes.'' \n \n Phone in hand, I was suddenly alone.

I set my phone down on my thigh and strapped my seatbelt over my lap. Backing out of the driveway, I happily imagined all of the noodles and crab Rangoon I was about to stuff myself full with. \n \n Gripping the steering wheel with one hand, I fiddled with the knobs on the dash until country music flooded into my truck. I tapped my fingers in time the beat and sang along with all of the impossible guitar solos. \n \n Right in the middle of the music, Siri cut in. \n \n `` In a quarter mile, turn left.'' \n \n Craning my neck, I looked a little further up the road and saw the street I was supposed to turn onto. It looks like it cuts through a small neighborhood, and I did n't even think that any China Buffets were off of the main roads. However, my mind wandered back to how many steaming sweet buns I could fit in my mouth and I swallowed, my stomach growling. \n \n As I turned into the residential area, I slowed down and coasted peacefully through the back roads. I noticed that it was more wooded and not many people were out and about. Of course, it was also kind of chilly outside, so it made sense to me that people would want to stay indoors. While still enjoying the scenery, Siri cut into my thoughts once again. \n \n `` In one thousand feet, turn right.'' \n \n I turned right. More directions followed, seemingly faster and faster and I could barely keep up. \n \n `` In one half of a mile, continue forward through the intersection. In three quarters of a mile, turn left. In 680 feet, turn right at the round-about.'' \n \n My tank was nearly empty now, I thought I must be at least close enough to a gas station to refill. Instead, I was only met by nothing but a rocky dirt road and the quiet whisperings of static as I was no longer in range of any radio station. \n \n I was starting to worry, what in the hell were these crazy directions? Suddenly, Siri pipped up once more. \n \n `` Speed up.'' \n \n Speed up? But I was almost out of gas and there was n't a single sign of a gas station anywhere. As I continued to drive along, I felt myself gaining speed. Glancing at my speedometer, I saw the needle slowly rising, seventy... Eighty... Ninety... Breaking one hundred miles an hour, I began to freak out. I stomped on my breaks, but nothing happened, and my truck only sped along faster. \n \n `` Siri, call 911!'' I shouted, grabbing my phone and wildly trying to unlock it. Siri gave me no response. As I frantically pressed in my unlock code, I looked up a split second before crashing headlong into a lake. \n \n The impact blasted a hole in the windshield and blue-black water gushed in, dousing me and pooling at my feet. Pressing all of my weight against the driver's door, I tugged furiously at the handle, but I could n't get it open. \n \n Slowly, as the water kept rising, my body felt more and more numb; the cab was filled to my waist and I was short of breath. Feeling weaker and colder by the second, I heaved one last time on the door, but still nothing gave way. \n \n My phone, now soaking wet and apparently functionless was still gripped between my white fingers. The water, now up to my neck, left me little air to breathe as I began pounding on the window. Just as I felt the cold chill reach my earlobes and leak into my ears, I heard Siri speak in that irritatingly nice tone: \n \n `` You have reached your destination.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] On a distant human colony on an alien planet everyone lives in one city , you and your crew are tasked to be the first to explore beyond the walls of the city .\n","story":"When they re-established contact with Earth, they were laughed at, their ship called a'textbook example of poorly-programmed AI'. It carried their cryogenically preserved bodies through the galaxy in search of a planet with conditions suited for human habitation, and when it found one, autonomously established a city-sized colony for them to inhabit. Unfortunately, the conditions suitable for human habitation do not extend much further than the colony itself, because it perches atop a barren plateau which pokes up through an interminable sea of beautiful, toxic gases. \n \n In the pursuit of more habitable space, numerous directions have been studied - tacking more structure onto the edges of the city has worked so far, as has simply building taller and taller above the plateau. However, other plateaus exist which could also support similar colonies; in addition, artificial habitats might be made to float on the boundary between the soup of deadly gases and the breathable region of the atmosphere, and according to some proposed plans, domed cities built at the actual solid surface ( like those on other less-friendly worlds ) might be an ideal solution. \n \n While the first few solutions are pursued by more cautious investors, Yukon Interstellar Housing were interested in surface real-estate on the planet Misma. In order to even conceive of such ventures, however, they needed to know the actual conditions at the bottom of the gaseous ocean. Since even the smartest probes never return, they outsourced the exploration to Hazard Scouts exploration, a small company which made a profit by doing the most dangerous scouting jobs in all of Human-owned space. \n \n What follows is a historical account, constructed from multiple sources, of the Hazard Scouts Eagle Crew's ill-fated mission to the true surface of the planet Misma. \n \n -- - \n \n The Eagle Crew had four members when it was assigned to explore the surface of Misma. Allen Martinson, Janet Ecstein, Carrie Belmont, and Herbert Thorley. With the exception of Thorley ( a new hire ), each was an experienced explorer of hostile alien environments. \n \n Martinson, the Mission Operator, led the crew with five years of experience in exploring hostile planets. He oversaw the movement and actions of the crew through a personal display device he carried, which showed live feeds of the crewmembers' helmet-mounted cameras, recordings of which were the main source used in this reconstruction of the mission. According to his colleagues, Martinson was a friendly man and a talented leader, successfully resolving deadly situations with no loss of life on multiple previous occasions. \n \n Ecstein was a biologist and first-contact specialist. Her wheelhouse was things that were alive, but she also dabbled in exotic fossilization ( the possible remains of previously-living aliens ) and xenogenesis ( the potential for alien life to arise later ). These fields were in their infancy at the time, and her limited knowledge would prove insufficient to deal with what the Eagle Crew would find at the surface of Misma. By all accounts she was very professional, and was even described as'level-headed' by Martinson and by Belmont as'a cool cat'. \n \n Belmont was an astrogeologist by training and a mountaineer by hobby; both served her well in her employment at Hazard Scouts. She carried the surveying equipment, intended to help compensate for the vision-obscuring gases by mapping out the surrounding terrain with electromagnetic imaging and transmitting that data to the helmet-mounted displays of the crewmembers. No records remain of her personal life; it is speculated that she did not keep any, preferring to remain solitary outside her day job. \n \n Thorley had been hired about a month previously, and had spent most of the intervening time undergoing training regimens and practicing in simulations to ensure he would be prepared for his first field mission. His assignment to Eagle Team was officially documented as'field training', as their next mission was expected to be a simple, run-of-the-mill mapping run of an inhospitable but static environment. \n \n Martinson was the only one to return from the surface of Misma. What details are not shown on the records of the helmet-mounted cameras have been provided by his testimony. \n \n -- - \n \n More to follow...\n"}

He looked more than an informant than a spy but Gustav learned in his time never to judge only on appearance. But the question he asked him was not the one he expected. He did n't know where weed and flowers grow happily together and doubted that it had something to with the fact that elephants turn pink when they drink alcohol. \n \n Maybe he forgot the right answer. After all, he was drinking a lot of alcohol himself, the evening before. He could feel the nagging pains in the side of his head from the one liquor he maybe drank too much but his memory never betrayed him like that before. If brains could smoke from thinking too much Gustavs head would probably be in flames as he thought about what the answer could be. Maybe it was some kind of political joke. It would seem fitting for the kind of questions the KGB usually thought of. `` In Al Gore's garden!'' \n \n Jack Brown let the answer sink into his head. Sure, Al Gore was kind of a fool. Even the CIA was aware of that. But he was pretty sure the right answer would have been `` In a fool's garden'' and not `` In Al Gore's garden''. As he thought about it the answer became clear.

Why was this man telling him that? Who does he work for? He simply nodded and before he could think another thought he heard two loud noises. \n \n On a bench right on the other side of the plaza two men were slowly sinking to the ground.

His face turned white as if he was the one with the gunshot wound and not his agent on the other side of the fountain. `` KGB.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] I never wore my suit , and I do n't know if it fits me anymore .\n","story":"You know the sort of suit that you look so good in that you want to be buried in it? A stark black suit that fit in all the right places. The kind you see in television or magazines, the one that others wore to make you want to be like them. Yeah, this was that kind of suit. A suit that I'd never worn. It hung in the closet waiting for a day that would never come. It hung there, lonely, covered in ash and debris as my atrophied digits ran the length of the sleeve. I lifted it from the offset bar with difficulty. It was heavier and larger than I remembered. The condition of the closet did n't help matters much either. \n \n In the smoke filtered light, I saw it as I had on the first day. It was handsome. I felt more attractive just being close to it. That was a hard thing to come by, being as I was. I imagined that it smelled terrible. It had to reek of death. A morbid thought that would have brought a smile to my face, if I had one. In fact, I was doing well to see or smell the suit at all. Even feeling the sleek fibers against my skin was a task I was no longer suited for. I feel that I would have laughed, or cried, or thrown a fit of rage, had I been able to. It was all so strange. \n \n \u201c It's a shame, \u201d I thought to myself, remembering the suit longingly as I'd seen it through my unspoiled gaze.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In an interesting turn of events , you have been forced to take over Death 's job .\n","story":"It was after the seventeenth stabbing that the shadowy figure appeared in my basement. \n \n It was a normal Tuesday morning, after my night shift at the packing plant had ended. I sat in my gaming chair, mindlessly mashing buttons on the controller and letting the bright colors on the display blur in front of me. My character on the screen plunged his knife into his foe's chest. The enemy dropped to the ground. \n \n I instinctively put a hand to my own chest. It had barely been three hours since that mugger skewered me, but like always, the wound had healed almost instantly, leaving yet another scar like the thousands that already crisscrossed my body. At this point I had almost stopped reacting to it. \n \n I sighed and paused the game to run a hand over my face, feeling the ugly regrown tissue. After surviving fire, acid, frostbite, guns, knives ( and once even a medieval mace ), I was sure that God had cursed me. What point was there in living when I was so disfigured I could only go outside at night, and then only with most of my face covered? When all of my friends had been driven away, because I seemed to attract death everywhere I went? \n \n In the midst of my self-pity, Death himself came to answer my questions. \n \n I began to be aware of a presence beside me. At first, I could n't see anything; I just felt a creeping sense of unease. Then the being slowly materialized into a mass of shifting darkness. \n \n I bolted out of my chair and ran for the stairs; suddenly, the shadowy mass appeared in front of me to block the way. \n \n `` You ca n't run from death,'' the voice boomed. I guess it was an attempt to sound impressive, but it just came across as edgy to me. I would have laughed if I was n't still terrified. \n \n `` Funny,'' I retorted, trying to keep my voice from shaking, `` I think I've done a pretty good job of that over the years.'' \n \n The wraith growled but did n't dispute my claim. `` You were supposed to have died years ago, wretched human, but none of my efforts were successful. In fact, the longer you survived, the weaker I became.'' The longer the voice spoke, the easier it was for me to tell that it was weary, and only attempting to project an image of strength. \n \n `` Why?'' I stepped closer to it, my burning curiosity overpowering my fear. `` Why ca n't I die?'' \n \n The shadow paused. In fact, it paused so long that I began to grow frustrated. \n \n `` Tell me!'' I reached out to grab it instinctively. A large repulsive force pushed me backward, but not before I realized, with revulsion, that the thing actually had mass and a cold, slimy texture. \n \n `` FOOLISH-'' A hacking sound suddenly began to emanate from the wraith, almost as if it were coughing. `` Give me a moment-'' Finally, it managed to compose itself. \n \n `` You are Death,'' it said simply. \n \n All I could do was stare. `` But I thought you were-'' \n \n `` Well, technically - technically, yes.'' If the shadow had a hand, it would have waved it. `` For now. I am here to pass on my title.'' \n \n `` The duty of separating souls from their bodies has always been performed by a former mortal. Spirits - demons, angels, and the like - can not physically manifest on earth. Death has to be present at the moment of a human's demise to collect their soul, so the task has always been given to those who were once human. However, the longer it has been since Death was human, the more difficult it is for them to physically manifest. When this power begins to decline, another human will appear, the one human who can resist Death's efforts to take their soul. This human is to be their successor.'' \n \n After that overload of information, all I could think to say was, `` Do I get a cloak and a scythe, or do I have to look like a weird blob?'' \n \n The wraith seemed to seethe, but it said begrudgingly, `` You can look like whatever you want.'' \n \n I saw a new vision of myself: a badass, grizzled warrior of souls, striking fear into the hearts of all who beheld me. Now I had no desire to fix my hideous face. It would only help my image. \n \n I grinned and extended a hand to my new mentor. \n \n `` Deal.''\n"}

Ever since then, people have been making up stories egging the myth of Santa on and on. Only stupid people believe in Santa, and we are n't stupid, are we?'' Her father asked, repeating the lie again. \n \n `` That's what I told Jeffory Cooten at school, but he keeps telling me Santa is real.'' Sally replied, smiling sweetly up at her father. \n \n `` See. You're not stupid at all.'' He told her, adjusting his gun out of habit. `` It's bed time. Come on. I'll tuck you in before I go back to the precinct.'' The detective said, scooping up his daughter and carrying her back to bed. It took him just a few moments to tuck her in. Afterwards, he kissed his wife and hit the road, motoring down Main street on his way to his office. The parking lot was nearly full, forcing the detective to park in the very back row, furthest from the building. \n \n `` Hey, Steve. You're early.'' His partner called from the next row over. `` Back row again?'' \n \n `` Yeah. My luck right?'' He laughed, locking his doors. \n \n `` You're own damn fault. You come in to early. Second Shift has n't had a chance to clear out yet.'' Detective Miller admitted. `` What's so damn urgent, you feel the need to come in early?'' \n \n `` Warehouse killings.'' Detective Schwitz answered. `` I've been finding more killings like this. All of them on Christmas Eve. All of them involving children in some way.'' \n \n `` Jesus,'' Miller exclaimed. `` Someone's killing children?'' \n \n `` No. Some vigilante out there has been out there killing people who've made a living out of hurting children. These,'' he said, tapping his briefcase, `` were human trafficers. Found one over on Vicar's Boulevard with a peppermint stick shoved through his eye and into his brain. It's a sick fuck does something like that.'' \n \n `` I hear you, man. But, on the bright side, they deserved it most likely.'' Miller pointed out sagely. \n \n `` Probably, but does n't change my job one bit. Worse, I know who killed them.'' He said. Miller waited patiently for the reveal. `` Santa.'' \n \n `` Santa? He does n't even deliver anymore. Everyone knows Mrs. Claus has taken over doing the deliveries. She's been doing the Christmas Eve runs for almost five years now. Santa's a drunk.'' Miller pointed out. \n \n `` He is n't a drunk yet. He just stares at that bourbon every night. I've had him under surveillance ever since the he killed those men in the warehouse. I'd love to nail the son-of-a-bitch, but we ca n't touch him.'' Schwitz said, shaking his head as if to deny the fact. \n \n `` Wait. You have him dead to rights on these murders, but you ca n't bring him in? Why the fuck not?'' Miller asked. `` I saw the pictures from that warehouse. He fucking hung half of the men with Christmas lights from the rafters. That's barbaric.'' He said, clapping his hands for emphasis. \n \n `` Diplomatic immunity.'' Schwitz explained. `` Santa has diplomatic immunity when he comes to the States. He has a postal address at the North Pole. It's a technicality. The post office has been accepting letters to Santa. The U.S. government has been backing that play by admitting that Santa is real. They've been doing all these little niceties for over a century asserting that Santa was real, but believing that they were talking about a made up holiday figure. As strange as it sounds, we've spent so much time creating actual statutes to reinforce our fantasy, that we've managed to provide Santa with a foreign dignitaries status and all the benefits that go with it including Diplomatic Immunity. Santa could walk out of that bar with a shotgun and gun down everyone on the street and we'd have to let him go.'' \n \n `` That's fucked up. How's Sophie doing? She adjusting okay to being Mrs. Clause?'' Miller asked. Schwitz shrugged. \n \n `` Bout what you'd expect. She keeps trying to lure Santa back to the North Pole to take back up his mantle, but he's wallowing in self pity and refuses to go. His daughter being diagnosed with cancer has n't helped their situation much. He wo n't leave her bed side. I feel for the man, but at the same time he's a serial killer vigilante who deserves to be locked up.'' Detective Schwitz confessed, holding the door open for his partner. \n \n `` I feel for the guy. Fuck those slavers. They deserved to die. You know and I know it.'' Miller told him, reacing out to squeeze his partners shoulder. `` Hang in there. You'll get your justice someday, most likely.'' Miller said it, but he did n't believe it. \n \n `` I know. I've talked to Sophie and surveillance has picked up on conversations between him and that elf that comes to see him. The longer Santa's away, the weaker his magic grows. Kids do n't believe in him as much. I've tried to help things along. I started a campaign online, explaining the situation with these killings. The purpose of the campaign is to convince our children Santa does n't exist.'' \n \n Miller gave him a quizzical look. `` What does that matter?'' \n \n `` In two years, Santa will qualify to be a U.S. citizen. When that happens, his diplomatic immunity will expire and I'll be able to arrest his ass finally. I need his magic to be gone by then, so when I lock him up, he ca n't escape.'' Schwitz said. \n \n `` Kind of low, buddy.'' Miller told him. \n \n `` Yeah. Well, I do n't like murderers regardless of their reasons. You want to help us out? We can always use another to spread the word.'' Detective Schwitz told him. `` The more the merrier.'' \n \n `` That's cold,'' Miller pointed out. `` You forget the hundreds of years he has n't been a killer or are you just pissed because he never brought you anything for Christmas. Fuck it. Happy hunting. Get him, do n't get him, whatever you do, just wait until after his daughter has passed on so she does n't have to see what he's become. \n \n `` Fine. That day is as far away as you thing.'' Schwitz told him, taking a seat at his desk and opening yesterday's survellance packet. He skipped through it and located the intel on Santa's daughter. He looked through the paperwork and found what he was looking for. The little girl's health was failing. Tonight might be her last day. `` About time.'' He whispered. `` About time.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] No one is dying anymore , physical ages now frozen . However no one is being born anymore either .\n","story":"For the first 300 years, or so, we called it a gift. We labelled immortality as the final step in human evolution, that we are a perfect species. Without resources going into medicinal equipment and experts, focus and money was shifted into industrialism and technology. We had evolved technology beyond what we had dreamed; implants, volunteer cybernetics, quantum computers, data that moves faster than the speed of light, to name a few. With brilliant minds never having to worry about being wasted on death, disease, and inevitable end, they were able to pursue their passions for decades, centuries until they had perfected their creations and ideas, twice-over. \n \n Religion and government were affected, too. Without the motivation of death towards the public in some of the worse-off countries, dictatorships and violent governments had started dissolving. Countries meshed and formed new republics, ones without the true fear of death that had kept so many silent and terrified. Religion was all about destroyed, with most counting on our deaths as a motivating factor behind morality, our idealism, and who we fear\/love the most. \n \n Of course, people, as is our nature, attempted violence, and experiments to see how far we could push our new bodies. Pain was still a real thing, but it was not nearly as scary and problematic as it used to be. Most attempts and experiments were all but complete in the first 50 years, and while there were still issues with more of the violent of our species, concern was low. Crimes that did not even directly affect a person's being were surprisingly rare. People with no fear have no problem defending their valuables, assets, and other people. Anyone who caused a serious and chronic problem, would be confined to sealed cells with no release, no food, or interaction as a final punishment. \n \n The animal kingdom changed, as well. The demand for certain things all but disappeared, mainly exotic foods, and we were able to drive back a mass extinction with the combined efforts of many republics, focusing on genetic and organic alterations and creation. Species were being born in labs, then large warehouses and being re-released back into their natural habitat. We learned how to make animal pelts without killing the actual animal, growing the dermis in factories, and other novelties like ivory were specially manufactured instead of tearing them from dying species. \n \n We were at our apex. We were peaceful, we had grown and achieved more than ever thought possible. Philosophy, art, science, and morality grew ten-fold. We worked together to create a positive world, because there was really no point in trying to kill each other anymore. The stars looked brighter, the world greener, and faces mostly carried contented looks and smiles. \n \n Then it all slowed down. Then it all but stopped. We began to realize that our gift was actually a curse. Once we had achieved what we wanted to achieve, what more was there? What could we do without new minds coming into their own and creating that which we had never conceived before. We never got to travel the stars, we never left the planet, and we did n't finish learning every mystery out there. When we began slowing down, we had no motivation to achieve, because we had no motivation to leave a legacy. The stronger minded individuals were able to keep some form of order for a little while, assuring the people who started to suffer from Immortality Sickness ( IS ) that this was just a phase, that we would bounce back like humans always do. Like an infection, however, IS spread through humans, slowly driving them mad, most reverted to a primal, instinctual way of being, language dissolving, technology becoming moot, and smaller groups forming, then finally they would just stop. Like corpses, they would stare unblinking, no movement in their bodies, completely unresponsive, and non-reactive to any stimuli. They were lost forever, staring and dead to everything around them. Some stopped while standing, some lying down, some while sitting, and they stayed like that for as long as we were able to observe it. They entered this final phase wherever they were when their brain decided to stop. We called this the final phase, or the Corpse Phase. The few of us left that kept our consciousness tried to reverse IS, but to no avail. Rapidly we fell, and within 20 years of the first recorded inception of IS, we had less than 10 % of the population functioning around the world. Unfortunately for the last 10 %, we felt like the unlucky bit of the population. We were able to survive, intact for almost another century, walking the streets and places where the corpses were propped. We tried to move them out of sight and mind, but it was to no avail. \n \n We have suffered a fate worse than death, all because we feared death too much. There is nothing left for the remaining humans to do but sit and wait, and hope that our eventual decline will be painless, and that we are not aware of our state for the rest of eternity. Unfortunately, from the tests we conducted on the first brains that fell into the Corpse Phase, there were still function brain patterns. Semi-Conscious brain patterns. They were stick, un-moving, but aware for the rest of eternity. \n \n It's funny how death is the greatest gift we could ever have.\n"}

Slay a monster here, earn the admiration of some townsfolk there, it had a pleasing sort of routine to it all. But you get tired of exploring dungeons and killing evil, and begin wanting to look for a chance to just settle down and get the happy ending you know you deserve. \n \n Finally, I was offered the request I had always been looking for, asked by a kingdom to dispose of an enemy evil overlord, whose monstrosities and armies had been terrorizing the country for generations. I was promised the reward of the princess \u2019 s hand in marriage and my very own \u201c happily ever after. \u201d \n \n I was a sucker for that kind of the thing, the happy ending. All I \u2019 d ever wanted was a carefree life, and if heroically taking one more enemy of mankind was the way to do it than I was determined to see this last quest through. \n \n So I took my plucky band of adventures through the domain of the Overlord. Smashing through his forces, we ascended through his keep and were at last met by the man himself. We engaged in the standard dialogue, with me launching into the classic speech of \u201c With my friends by my side, there's no way I can lose! \u201d and him going to the ever classic mocking laugh and bragging of how we stood no chance against his strength and secret powers. Ho-hum. At last he finished his speech and we finally got to the point where we could begin trying to kill one another. \n \n The fighting went on for a while I suppose. A sort of awkward dance between the two of us, I doing my best to avoid being killed and he ever so clumsily hurtling his attacks somewhere in my general direction. I won \u2019 t bother you with the details. \n \n Honestly, for being a final boss of sorts, it wasn \u2019 t very difficult at all to knock him to his knees. I then got to the part where I could contemplate if I should take the merciful route of capturing him and taking him back to the kingdom for his just punishment. But I wanted my happily ever after dammit, and I didn \u2019 t want it being spoiled by having to come back to save the kingdom in Overlord: The Sequel when he somehow breaks out of prison and reinstates his rule over the hordes of evil. \n \n So I decided to follow through on the old adage of \u201c Cut the head off a snake and the body dies \u201d and promptly chopped his head off. I suppose you may have been expecting some kind of remorse or something for his life, but quite frankly I was just happy the quest was over with and that I could finally get to my happy ending. \n \n That \u2019 s the thing about life though. There is no such thing as an \u201c ending \u201d when it comes to life. In the stories, the brave heroes come home to a feast and have a nice big party before riding off into the sunset, their love interest in tow. The End rolls across the screen, and everyone lives happily ever after. \n \n Reality, however, is a different story. It turns out that when you depose an evil overlord the evil legions and hordes of vicious monsters they employed don \u2019 t just go away, running off to whatever hell they came from. No, in reality, when you cut off the head of the snake a hundred more will sprout in its place as a result of a thing known as a \u201c power vacuum \u201d. A hundred new warlords had been created in a flash of a sword, each trying to one up one another in how much terror and carnage they could create. \n \n And than you have problems like the \u201c refugee crisis \u201d where thousands of civilians begin pouring over the borders of the good kingdom in an attempt to escape the ravages of the warlords. Needless to say, when I finally arrived at the kingdom in search of what I thought was my justly earned reward, the king was not pleased. I suppose that when he had handed out this quest, he hadn \u2019 t truly considered what would happen after his country was freed from the evil of the old Overlord. Without the bureaucracy holding them in check, the new warlords were causing far more damage than the Overlord ever had. \n \n Conjuring up all the political skill the he had learned over a long career of avoiding blame, the king proceeded to point the source of all his people \u2019 s problems squarely at me. At this point I wondered if perhaps my misguided solution to the Overlord problem would work better here. I restrained myself however, and offered to solve this last problem of his by quieting the warlords once and for all. \n \n And so began my journey to become the new Evil Overlord. \n \n A\/N I rushed this one a little but I hope you enjoyed it nonetehless.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You wake up to find yourself in a completely empty room devoid of any apparent means of escape , save for a single large red button with a sign next to it that reads , `` the only way out '' .\n","story":"Richmond was not happy with his life. It seemed like a natural path; good grades in high-school, Harvard law, an MBA to follow up, marriage, two children, a messy divorce after an affair, and seeing his children once a month after they moved half the country away. He was a successful man, in upper-middle management of a law firm, a job that required eighty hour work weeks. But most of all, he was bored. \n \n Waking up in this room left him confounded. It was a perfect cube, twenty feet from side to side. Smooth metal walls. And a big red button. \n \n A big red button and a sign saying `` the only way out''. He was a lawyer, and trusted that vague phrasing as much as he did his ex-wife, who had carefully turned the children against him until they could barely stand to be in the same room as him. He trusted that sign about as much as he did his coworkers, who would gleefully destroy him if they only had a chance. He trusted those words about as much as he trusted himself to be happy. And Richmond was not a happy man. \n \n He ran his hands over every inch of the room he could reach. The dull steel had not so much as the tiniest indent on it. The florescent light at the top of the room gave artificiality to the surroundings that felt somehow more natural than the fake comfort of the aesthetics of his office. Worst of all, there was absolutely no sound. He could hear himself breathing, the rush of blood through his ears, his heartbeat, all of the things that the background noise of the outside world drowns out. \n \n There was no door. The walls were just one hunk of metal, no seems or cracks in the corners, no place for a door to be. He saw no way he could be put into this room that required anything less than it be built around him. As to why someone would do that? Well, he had his share of enemies. His ex-wife would want him dead, and a few of his clients that could n't dare leave him. Richmond thought for a second that perhaps he was being paranoid, that the utter alien silence of the room was getting to him. The lack of anything to smell other than his clothes, now on him for at least a day, the only taste in his mouth that of bad morning breath... maybe it was getting to him. \n \n Naturally, he dismissed this. No one would be doing him a favor by this. The place had no way in or out, so there is no way out. Not until he dies of thirst. Or banging his head against the wall until he bleeds out. \n \n... or that button. \n \n A big red button. \n \n The *only* way out. \n \n `` Well, since I already know what the only way out is...'' he said to himself. \n \n His hand wavered over the button.

Just thinking of the ordeals and all I deal with every day brings me dread deep in my mind. The screaming. The crying for fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, cousins, lovers each and every day. Being drafted in itself was terrible. My father, old and wise, took me by the shoulder and whispered wise words to me. My mother gave me a kiss good-bye. I had graduated from medical school, just then. They were proud. My kid brother looking up to me. He was hardly 17, about to finish his last year of high school. I do not remember my family much anymore, despite their protests to not let me go. My brother was more a soldier than I. He was a tall, strong man. The look of horror in their eyes when I start to cut through my good memories when I try to think. I doubt I'd even recognize my family if I seen them. I do not like the look, the fear in their eyes. But I know it is necessary. They would die a slow painful death without it, from disease, gangrene, what have you. It all exists down here in the painful war. Some nights I wake and find the eyes of men in my dreams continue to stare me down, questioning why I could n't save them. Why their lovers would never see them again. Why their family would never see them again. And today was one of the roughest days of my life. They were attempting to rush through again today. Heavy causalities. I was cutting, chopping, prescribing, ordering, I might've well as been a butcher. I was a doctor, but this.. This was n't my call. Finally, I reached the end of the line.

The guy even bubble wrapped my phone and then called me. Yea, he got me. \n \n The man on the phone did n't sound like anyone I knew, but I did n't know all of his friends. So I decided to ignore the weird phone call and forget it ever happened. Janice from payroll walked by and I recalled that one evening after too much to drink and before I got the corner office. I tried not to watch her walk down the aisle toward the copy machine, but then again, I am a man and she's a woman. What a woman too! \n \n Alice, my secretary waved her hand in front of my face, catching me in mid stare. \n \n `` Earth to Bob! There's a delivery out on the loading dock for you.'' \n \n `` Have one of the guys sign for it,'' I said, annoyed at the interruption. \n \n `` I'm sorry, but they insist that you sign for it in person. They were very insistent,'' she replied. \n \n I took my feet down off my desk and stood up and stretched. \n \n `` I'll be right back,'' I told nobody in particular, since Alice had already returned to her desk. \n \n I walked the fifty yards down the long aisle that ran the length of the building, opening onto a steel fire door that led to the warehouse. As I pushed the door open, my arm still felt sore from yesterday's blood drive. Larry the supply manager waved at me through the windows of his booth, and I could hear his television blaring something about an airline crash somewhere in Virginia. Unless it landed on our building or my home, I did n't want to know until I had at least a whisky under my belt. \n \n Two of the stock workers passed me on the floor of the warehouse with worried looks on their faces. \n \n `` Creo que es la polic\u00eda. Esos pendejos en trajes son agresivos,'' said Hermano. \n \n `` Si!'' replied Carlos, a big guy with a scar across his lip from what I suspect was a knife fight. \n \n The gate was down, so I went to the outside door to the right of it and pulled it open. Just outside two men in black suits stepped forward and threw a bag over my head, before I could dart back inside. I did n't have a chance to escape when one of the men cuffed me, nearly cutting the circulation off in my hands. It all happened so fast. A few seconds later I was thrown into the back of a van. They were driving fast, and I heard horns blare as my abductors raced from the scene. Several tense minutes later I heard the distinct sound of a helicopter rotor in the distance. It grew in volume, until the sliding door on the van was thrown open, and the men yanked me out, dragged my across what felt like a lawn and threw me roughly onto the floor of what I assumed was the chopper. \n \n I smelled his cologne before I saw him. When they removed the bag from my head, I saw a smiling oily official in an Italian suit looking down upon me, like the cat that ate the canary. \n \n `` You are doing your country a great service.'' \n \n He then spoke into the headset he wore and said, `` Pilot, get us to Bethesda, Maryland ASAP!'' \n \n Then we were in the air. \n \n As we cruised above the Virginia countryside I wondered why they were taking me to a hospital, but then I remembered something on the radio about Air Force One and the president. \n \n `` You should feel honored that your heart and liver are a perfect match, Mister Woods.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The first satallite sent from Earth detects a planet sharing our Orbit , but was previously blocked from view by the sun .\n","story":"The probability that a system contains a planet capable of sustaining life is astronomical. The possibility of there being two such planets in the same system is even *more* unlikely. The chances that these two worlds would share the same orbit is impossible. At least, that's what we thought. \n \n At 3:14a on Friday, July 17, 2015, the Venus orbiter Ceres XI discovered something impossible. In a mirrored Earth-orbit, on the exact opposite side of the sun, traveling at the same relative rate of revolution, was a second Earth. It was the same beautiful shade of sapphire blue, with the same life-breathing atmosphere and the same rejuvenating lunar cycle. It was our home... yet home to something else. Something eerily familiar. \n \n The first remote probes were sent less than two days later. The entire scientific community had been swept up in the fervor of what was considered at the time to be the greatest discovery in human history. Every brand of scientist -- from chemists to botanists, geologists to meteorologists -- wanted a piece of the action. In total, sixteen probes were sent to collect a slew of data. Each of the probes could broadcast an unprecedented 18TB of raw information and imagery per second back to Earth using state-of-the-art telecommunication tech and a massive string of orbital satellites forming a veritable string between the two worlds. The entire world watched on TVs, monitors and phones as the first live feeds began trickling in during the early hours of July 19th. Nobody was ready for what they saw. \n \n As the probes began to enter the other Earth's magnetosphere, familiar glints were spotted spinning around the planet. At first, people scoffed at the images, certain they were seeing their own Earth in what many suspected to be a kind of global practical joke. The glints were satellites. And not a *variety* of satellite. They were *our* satellites. Even in appearance -- cylindrical bodies with wing-like solar panels -- they were identical. The reality of the situation only became clear when the probes got close enough to make out the flags on the fuselages. None of them were recognizable. \n \n The real surprise, though, came when the probes cleared the atmosphere. The world released a collective gasp: \n \n Jet aircraft trailed through the blue sky, criss-crossing over continents dotted with massive urban centers. As the probes descended further, they saw skyscrapers, colossal stadiums, and endless networks of highways and railways. They broadcast haunting images of human life over 300 million kilometers from our Earth. They saw all the staples of contemporary human society and technology. They saw human beings. *Human beings. * Living, breathing, walking, and driving. Some of them stopped and stared at the probes as they whisked through the air hundreds of meters above. All of humankind was gripped with an immense sense of wonder and trepidation. Everyone was so entranced by what they were witnessing that they had forgotten one key fact: these creatures were human. \n \n Only twelve minutes into the broadcast, drone feeds started going dark. One by one, each of the sixteen drones disappeared from Earth-bound receptors. Only the last three, turning their cameras skyward, saw the inbound interceptors before they fired their missiles. \n \n All at once, people were reminded of the grim reality of human nature. Wonder gave way to fear, and fear gave way to hatred. A global campaign began to build an interstellar invasion army. They called it the `` Expeditionary Force.'' By the fourth day, our Earth was ready to fly across the solar system and destroy itself. But we never got the chance. \n \n On July 23rd at 11:48a, a series of objects cleared our orbiting satellites and pushed their way into our atmosphere. These objects, upon reaching the stratosphere, broke into a series of smaller objects. Across the globe, ground-to-air countermeasures were deployed to intersect the objects, but it was too late. \n \n The last thing we saw as a species was a blinding, burning light that filled the entire sky. In a worldwide flash, our bright blue sapphire -- the cosmic symbol of human endeavor itself, in all its beautiful imperfection -- was reduced to a smoldering coal. We were no more. \n \n As the last of us retreated underground, savoring what would be our last few hours of breath, our final thoughts were of our legacy. Would we be missed? Would we even be remembered? But I knew better. I knew this was n't our end. We would live on. For better? \n \n For worse. \n \n There was no comfort in knowing we would survive. In knowing that across our own solar system, another brood of humanity survived and thrived. Because I knew the reality of being human. \n \n Humans are scared, stupid, and self-destructive. They're selfish, impatient, and angry. They seek only to expand themselves; to exhaust their environment for nothing more than a circular existence. They fear what they do n't understand, and destroy what they fear. \n \n Ironic, then, that we destroyed ourselves.\n"}

I do n't have to make anything for you, you know. That's my choice because I know you'd fucking starve yourself if I did n't heat up macaroni and cheese for you like a six year old. I'm not your 1950s trophy wife.'' \n \n Oh my god, seriously? `` What?'' I said. \n \n The old woman scurried away past us with her tiny basket of groceries in hand. My wife's eyes followed her. \n \n `` 1950s trophy wife? Where the hell did that come from?'' \n \n My wife rolled her eyes and turned away. `` Let's just buy this.'' \n \n We rolled up to the checkout counter, swiped her credit card, and drove home wordlessly. \n \n **** \n \n The next day I woke up feeling shitty as I'd ever woken up. My wife left for work earlier than I did, so the bed was already empty. I glanced at her closet and saw everything in disarray. There was a suit jacket hanging off of one end of a hanger and a peacoat crumpled on the ground. I got up and hung them both up straight. \n \n I sighed and glanced at her jewelry box. It was open, with necklaces hanging out. I noticed a lace bra draped over the table and several earrings missing their partner. She must be wearing the gold chain I got her for her birthday last month. She really liked that necklace. She said she felt `` regal'' wearing it, and that made me smile. \n \n I picked up her bra and put it into her drawer but there was no way in hell i would mess with her jewelry. \n \n At work I found myself on edge. When I was nervous like that, though, I was often more productive. I lost myself in the equations and it was n't until 3pm that I realized that I had skipped lunch to finish a project. I saw a flash of long, blonde hair out of the corner of my eye. My boss Jill knocked on my office door. `` Derek?'' \n \n `` Yo.'' We're casual like that there. \n \n `` Did you get my email?'' \n \n I paused and quickly opened a gmail tab on my laptop. `` Oh, there it is. Sorry Jill, I was just finishing the report for this weekend and got a call about an audit around nine so I was focusing and making up for lost time. Did n't mean to ignore you.'' \n \n `` No it's okay. You seem pissed, though, is everything okay?'' \n \n I chuckled. `` I seem pissed? A little busy, maybe, but pissed?'' \n \n `` Yeah, I mean, not on the surface, but you're tense for sure.'' Jill looked concerned. Really, actually concerned. \n \n Feeling that was refreshing. I could n't remember the last time somebody had actually asked me if I was `` okay.'' Tears welled up in my eyes. \n \n `` I'm sorry, I just...'' now my arms were shaking. God, I needed to calm down. \n \n `` Hey. Hey. It's alright, man. Just tell me what's up.'' Jill walked in and closed the door behind her. \n \n I breathed in deeply. Stopped shaking. `` Sammy is unhappy.'' \n \n Jill frowned and nodded. She sat down in the chair in front of my desk. \n \n `` We hardly see each other anymore since she got promoted. She told me the first few weeks would be killer, but I ca n't even go to the grocery store with her without her blowing up about how stressed she is.'' I felt new tears rolling down my cheeks. `` And the reason I even went shopping with her in the first place was to get a little bit more time with her than I would staying at home. But then she was pissed that I was n't able to stay home and clean the place.'' \n \n Jill nodded again. `` That sucks that she's taking it out on you.'' \n \n I laughed. `` Yeah.'' \n \n `` But I mean, it sounds like she knows this is a temporary thing and is just having a hard time getting used to it. It does n't have anything to do with you.'' Jill crossed her legs and leaned forward. \n \n I breathed deeply and closed my laptop. `` I'm just another burden to her, lately. Everything I do seems to annoy her. That's not what I want. I want to be a respite. I want her to come home and look forward to it. Yesterday she told me she felt like a 1950s trophy wife.'' \n \n `` Oh, wow.'' \n \n I shrugged. `` She does make dinners every night. I know that's playing into gender roles and all that but honestly I never eat unless someone reminds me to.'' \n \n `` Yeah, that's not healthy man.'' \n \n `` I know.'' \n \n `` Look, you say that you want to be a respite for your wife. But honestly, do you look forward to going home and being with her? Is she *your* respite?'' \n \n I opened my mouth but said nothing. She had a point. \n \n Jill uncrossed her legs and sat up. `` But that does n't mean you're not'happy' with her. That does n't mean you're about to leave her. It just means that you need to work at it. Both of you.'' \n \n I nodded. \n \n `` Since you're the one bitching about it, why do n't you make the first step. Stop forcing her to make you dinners. Make your own damn casseroles from now on, and do her grocery shopping for her. If she's doing all the housework then it's not too off-base to feel a little like a housewife.'' Jill paused. `` I know you'd do anything for her. You just need to communicate that.'' \n \n I nodded again. Gears started turning in my head. A plan developed. `` Jill, I think I'm going to head home a little early today.'' \n \n **** \n \n On my way home from the grocery store I examined the bottle of chicken souls at a red light. There was a recipe for Spectral Cajun stir-fry on the label. It did n't look too difficult. \n \n As I pulled into the driveway, my heart dropped. My wife's chevy cavalier was already there. In spite of myself, I began looking around for another car. A man's car. \n \n *Okay, just stop. * I told myself. But I could n't think of any reason for her to be home early. She got off at six. We usually walked in the door ten minutes apart from each other. I started thinking back to the last few days. Did she seem to always be home before me lately? \n \n Okay, even if bringing some asshole home and fucking him in our house was her plan, there was nobody in her life that she would be interested in that way. She told me all about her days at work. Her coworkers are very bland and married. She's only good friends with the 19 year old girl interning at the office. Where would she even have time to meet people? \n \n Why was I even thinking about this? I trusted my wife. I loved her. I was so confused, though. I got out of my car and sprinted up the steps, pulled out my key and opened the door in one fluid movement. \n \n I stepped in and closed the door behind me quickly. Then I listened. Nothing except for the crackling of the stove and chickens clucking. Clucking? \n \n `` Shit.'' I heard from the other room. `` Shit shit shit.'' Sammy veered around the corner. She was in an apron. She gave me a big, sheepish smile. `` Shit! Why are you back so early, babe?'' \n \n I could n't say anything. She walked up to me and hugged me close. \n \n `` I'm such a bitch.'' She said. `` I'm such a bitch I'm such a bitch I'm such a bitch.'' \n \n It really hurt me to hear her say that. Especially now. I held her tighter. `` I love you, Sammy. I bought some more chicken souls if you ran out.'' \n \n She laughed. `` Oh god! More souls is the last thing we need. I misread the recipe and bought three times as much as I needed. Hope you like spectral stir-fry.'' She let go of me and walked back into the kitchen. `` Oh, and I love you too.'' \n \n I watched her walk. `` Do n't you have work?'' I followed her to the stove. \n \n `` You were more important today.'' The stove clicked as she turned the heat down. `` Wait, do n't *you* have work?'' \n \n `` I was planning to be your 1950s trophy husband tonight. You beat me to it.'' I hugged her from behind. \n \n `` Your turn tomorrow for sure.''\n"}

After 8 years the phone finally rings .\n","story":"I've been sitting in this room for eight years. Just sitting. I have n't bathed, I have n't slept, I have n't had any human contact whatsoever. \n \n The phone on the desk is haunting, teasing me, with it's useless keypad and it's cord that leads somewhere, anywhere. Nowhere. I have n't tried to yank the cord out of the wall, I do n't know if it's because I know nothing will happen or because I'm scared that something will. \n \n The phone itself is black, the buttons on the keypad red and all of the numbers different colors. The chair I have been sitting on is blue, reminding me so much of one of the chairs I used to lean in and bend the backs and constantly stick gum on in school. The walls are a dull beige, my least favorite color ( is it anyone's favorite, really? ) and is more-than-slightly similar to oatmeal. \n \n I feel as though I have gone insane, completely mad, just by sitting in the same room for years. I do n't remember there being a time before this, before I was locked in this awful, barely office-like, apple cinnamon smelling room, just the weird blurry window that only shows a beam light on the other side of the wall, allowing just enough light for me to see. \n \n I do n't try to escape, I do n't bang on the walls and scratch at the plastic desk that is the same color as the third number on the phone. I do n't jab and poke and prod and pound the keypad on the phone, I do n't try to break the receiver in half. I know it will be useless, so I do n't waste my energy. \n \n I once again look at the phone. It's still black. It seems that the numbers have changed different colors. I know that I am wrong, my mind trying to make up a mystery for me to solve, something for me to do. I know this because the third number is still the same color as the desk. \n \n I've decided that I have nothing else to do, so I start putting different number combinations in like my name, random words like fish or help. \n \n The phone rings. I do n't notice it at first, my head too preoccupied with the buttons to care. Before I press one that may decline the call ( although that is unlikely, as previously stated they do n't seem to work ), I snap out of it and pick up the phone. \n \n `` Hi honey! It's mom, I'd just like to see how you were doing.'' \n \n `` Mother?'' \n \n At first, I could n't believe it. Then I was angry. \n \n `` How dare you call me after eight years! I have been sitting here, going insane! Where am I!? Why ca n't I get out!? I contemplated very deep things in here! For heavens sake, I became a fucking poet just to have something to do! What is wrong with you!?'' \n \n `` Sweetie, it's been eight hours. Your shift is almost over. If you hate your new job that much, why do n't you quit?'' \n \n The door opened. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Needs could never be fully met because during deliberation, which is something they had to constantly, they either could n't be fully expressed or were intentionally overlooked by others.

It was exciting at first, I got studied by scientists ( who could n't figure out how it worked ), got invited to universities, gave a TED talk and even got to meet the president!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In a world where everyone dreams , one boy does not . People try to reassure him that he does and just ca n't remember , but the alienation and suspicion slowly builds over time .\n","story":"You are five when you start to understand that there is something wrong with you. In class, between talk of numbers and letters Greg wants to know what you dreamt last night. \n \n `` I do n't know,'' you say. \n \n `` Okay.'' He replies. \n \n On the other side of the room Hannah gets a crayon stuck up her nose and you are distracted. That night you try and imagine what a dream is. You know it is important like your teddy. Maybe, if you stay up, you can see a dream. Soon you fall asleep. It is dark and endless. You forget about that question for a long time. \n \n **** \n \n The first week of summer vacation is something you enjoy. You have just finished sixth grade and feel on top of the world. A group of friends decide to go to the amusement park. It is loud, bright, chaotic. Tbere are food smells and the hot pavement and the chemical taste of sunscreen in the back of your mouth. After the the third go on the Tilt-a-Whirl your head feels light. Ben staggers next to you. \n \n `` I'm drunk!'' He shouts. \n \n Neither of you are quite sure what it means to be drunk, but you laugh and stagger together. \n \n You gorge on cotton candy ( or try too. The stuff is too light for that full feeling ) and drink soda. You forget about the sun screen your mom packed. You are slick with sweat. Greg's face has become a bright cheesy red like a cartoon character. You have to go to the bathroom. Inside it is cool. The lights hurt. A sound is buzzing in the back of your head. The door seems very far away. Something is horribly wrong. The tile is nice and cold. Someone is shaking you, `` can you hear me?'' but it's a stupid question. The world has gone flat. You wonder if you are dreaming. \n \n You wake up in the hospital with a wicked headache and a small scar. \n \n Your mom is sitting by you bedside. \n \n `` Your appendix burst.'' And she starts crying. \n \n **** \n \n You do n't tell anyone that you ca n't dream. There is no test for it, no regulations or rules. At lunch you do n't volunteer anything. If you are asked directly you can make something up. Usually it's a mixture of books and movies and what you hear others say. Standing naked in the school. Flying. A magical door. Something vast and nameless chasing you. \n \n Ron chews his sandwich noisily. `` What about nightmares?'' \n \n `` What about them?'' Ben's turned into an ass lately. Everyone ignores him. \n \n `` I have one about crabs.'' Danny starts. Ron snorts. \n \n `` Did you tell your girlfriend that?'' \n \n Ben chortles to himself. You'd all been giving Danny shit, but Ben had a talent for making it cruel. \n \n `` Shut up.'' You say. For a moment you are distracted by you lunch. The lid on your sandwich container is stuck. \n \n You glance up to see everyone starting. `` What?'' \n \n `` What do you have nightmares about?'' Ron is actually interested. Everyone else is getting bored. Ben starts flicking scraps of paper at the back of Cassy Thomas' head. \n \n `` Nothing.'' You say it stupidly. It's a second of horrible honesty. \n \n Ron looks confused. \n \n `` Woah.'' Danny says. `` That's freaky. Like, *nothing* nothing?'' \n \n `` Yeah.'' You have their attention. Now you have to lose it. `` Totally dark.'' \n \n `` What about your appendix?'' Greg is trying to kick Ben under the table as he talks. \n \n `` Sometimes.'' You agree. `` What about you?'' \n \n Greg shrugs. `` Clowns, mostly.'' \n \n `` What else?'' Ron is obnoxious. He wants to know every detail. \n \n `` Your mom.'' And Ben is howling with laughter. \n \n **** \n \n Greg calls you that night. Over the sounds of dinner and the TV you almost miss it. You dad picks it up. \n \n `` It's for you.'' He hands you the phone. At the table mom and Jeff are talking about the car. Jeff wants to borrow it for the weekend. \n \n `` Hello?'' \n \n `` Hi-ya.'' It's Greg. He's the only one that talks like that. \n \n `` Hi, Greg.'' \n \n `` Are you alone?'' \n \n It's a dumb question. The kitchen table is less than ten feet from you. If he was any louder the whole family could hear him. You tell him as much. \n \n `` I'm alone.'' He sounds nervous. He's breathing through his mouth. `` I got ta ask you something.'' \n \n You wait. He does n't say anything. \n \n `` I'm waiting.'' You tell him. \n \n `` I know you ca n't dream.'' \n \n For an asinine second you think this must be a dream. It's too messed up not to be one. \n \n `` What do you mean?'' \n \n `` Well, at least you think you ca n't. Right?'' \n \n You swallow hard. Over the line you can hear the echo of your throat clicking. Your mom has stopped talking to Jeff and is working at ignoring him. You know it does n't matter because Jeff got a copy of the keys made last month when he started hooking up with Fanny Howard behind the YMCA. On TV someone is complaining about the state of the country, why on earth an actor got into the White House. Greg is still talking. \n \n You cut him off. You give some excuse about homework or dinner and hang up. When you come back to the table your mom looks concerned. Somehow you convince her it's nothing. \n \n It wo n't last long. \n \n **** \n \n Mrs. Green is a teacher you respect but would never admit to doing so. She's old and oddly frail under the fat that hangs off her. She asks you to stay after class. `` It will only take a moment, hon.'' You never imagined that Greg told her. \n \n It turns out he did. \n \n `` You ca n't *not* dream.'' She says. `` It's not possible. Maybe you do n't remember all of them, but you do dream.'' \n \n `` I do n't.'' You insist. `` There's nothing.'' \n \n `` There is.'' She pats your arm. `` I'm sure there is. You're not trying hard enough.'' \n \n You walk out. \n \n **** \n \n Your parents are terrified of what it might mean. Jeff tries to act the same, but you can see worry lurking. He does n't even ask about the car. They handle you with kid gloves. You go to a shrink every Tuesday. She smells like clove cigarettes and has helmet hair. \n \n School is another story. Your prom date ditches you but keeps the ticket and goes with Wes Nichols. Ben avoids you like its contagious. Ron is overly sensitive. He starts keeping a dream diary for you in secret. You discover it when he drops the notebook in the hall one day. You stop talking to pretty much everyone after that. When you graduate you do it with your head down. You only apply to colleges far away. Jeff somehow understands and offers to drive you to the recruiters. When you get there Jeff enlists. He makes a big deal about the paperwork. The recruiter seems impressed, but you realize that you'd never get past the background. Not with your shrink. \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Thousands of years after nuclear war destroyed our civilization , a society of medieval fantasy has risen on Earth . You 're leading a group of adventurers in a dungeon that in our times was a secret military base .\n","story":"Strange noises came from the corridor, like the noise of a thousand of rats dancing to a waltz. The walls glowed with a sickly green pallor, strange veins of rust running rampant along its ways. The noise continued, continued, and then stopped, leaving the room silent but for the muffled cough and heavy breathing of our group. \n \n \u201c Halt. \u201d I put my hand back, indicating for the group to stop. Zarkaz heaved his hammer, preparing for a fight. \n \n \u201c What do you think it is? \u201d Mariah pulled her dagger from her belt loop. \u201c Trouble, like we \u2019 d seen before? \u201d \n \n I raised my finger to my lips, indicating for them to be silent. No one had ever been this far before. At least, not this far and lived to tell the tale of it. Many bones and half rotted bodies laid testament to attempts to reach this point, but nary a one had reached this point. But for us. \n \n To say that we were lucky was a lie. To say that we were both lucky and *skilled* wouldn \u2019 t be too far from the truth. But now? I feared our luck may be running out, and what lay ahead would be beyond even our capable hands. \n \n Silence was still the golden rule in the hallway we inhabited, but for one noise. Metallic thuds were coming\u2026 Coming from somewhere. But where? \n \n ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-thump. *** \n \n A single bit of sweat fell down my cheek. \n \n ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-*** \n \n The noise stopped. It was close. Too close\u2026 Where- \n \n \u201c From above! \u201d I dived to the left, further down the hallway. Mariah followed suit but it was far too late for Zarkaz. With a roar that would make his race proud, the mighty Nordsman swung his hammer in the air at what seemed to be a massive steaming pile of greasy grey fur, mouths, and thousands of tiny claws. \n \n The mouths suddenly all coalesced into one vacant, black hole and swallowed both hammer and arm, whole. The fight was quick and brutal, leaving the Zarkaz twitching silently on the floor. \n \n \u201c Zarkaz! \u201d Mariah screamed, trying to run back to him but was held back by my hand. \n \n \u201c He knew the risks when he signed up for this dungeon, Mariah. \u201d I turned away, disgusted by the sickening squelching noises of the creature feasting. \u201c Now c \u2019 mon. While it \u2019 s distracted. Let \u2019 s keep moving. \u201d \n \n Mariah \u2019 s face twisted up at the dishonorable thing we were doing, but if she had any concerns, she didn \u2019 t voice them. I was glad for that, we needed to get going. \n \n Who knew what that noise could have attracted? \n \n I felt around my pack as we walked, searching for the old map that we had traded the old man for back in town. In all likelihood, it was fake. But there was something about it\u2026 \n \n \u201c We should have gone back. We should have given him a proper warrior \u2019 s burial. \u201d Mariah looked back once more, thumbing her knife. Even from the distance we had walked, we could still hear it eating. \n \n \u201c If we had, we would be dead. \u201d I continued to look at the map, trying to discern the ancient writing that indicated what our path was that lied ahead. \u201c And then where would we be? \u201d \n \n I squinted at the writing, trying to form it into words. \u201c Certainly nowhere near the *s e r v e r* room. Whatever that means. \u201d \n \n \u201c *S e r v e r* room? \u201d Mariah frowned. \u201c Maybe it \u2019 s where the ancient ones housed their servants? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah, could be. \u201d I stopped talking, and listened for a moment. \u201c You hear that? \u201d \n \n \u201c No. I don \u2019 t hear anything. \u201d Mariah twisted in confusion, and then in horror as she realized what I meant. \n \n \u201c Exactly. \u201d I grabbed her hand, pulling her in my wake. \u201c Run! \u201d \n \n A screech emanated from down the passageway, as the creature, now finished devouring Zarkaz \u2019 s body realized that it \u2019 s prey was perhaps a bit more clever than it was. The sound of heavy limbs slamming into the metal floor came closer and closer as the creature chased us towards the room that lay ahead. \n \n \u201c Quickly! \u201d I said as I reached the open door. \u201c Get in! \u201d \n \n Mariah reached the door just as the creature turned the corner of the hallway behind us. With a rusty screech from both the door and the creature, the door closed with a sudden clang, it \u2019 s metallic bolts resisting until the very last moment. With a sound like a hollow log hitting the ground, the creature slammed into the door. Howling in dismay, it tried several more times, and then suddenly stopped, seeming to have given up it \u2019 s impossible battle against the door. \n \n \u201c What is this place...? \u201d Mariah looked around in awe, awash in a dark, red glow. \n \n I too, turned around, and took in my surroundings. Thousands upon thousands of strange black boxes sat in rows upon rows, as far as the eye could see. A reddish hue enveloped the place, the light coming from strange *willo-the-whisp*-like structures that adorned the walls. Stark red letters to the sides of them read *E m e r g e n c y*, a word in ancient that I did not know. Below that, in smaller blue letters read *S e r v e r* room. \n \n \u201c A Server room but without any servants? \u201d I picked up one of the black boxes and shook it, strange string coming out the backside as I did so. \u201c Are these one of the servants? Can I command it? \u201d \n \n I set it back on it \u2019 s place in the stack and put out my hand. With a strong force of will, I spoke with as much power as I could muster. \u201c Servant of the Ancients! I command thee to do work! \u201d \n \n And with a gush of power, my voice echoed throughout the room. And\u2026 And..! \n \n Nothing happened. \n \n Mariah laughed, despite her otherwise somber mood. \u201c What did you think would happen, Heracles the Great? \u201d \n \n I put out my lower lip. \u201c Might as well try my luck. \u201d \n \n Mariah picked up one of the boxes and tapped it with her knuckle, trying to listen to what was inside it. \u201c What do you think these things did, once upon a time? \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m not sure, but I bet they \u2019 re long beyond the days when they did work. \u201d I gestured towards a door I saw at the far end of the room. \u201c We should get a move on. There \u2019 s nothing in this room worth taking. \u201d \n \n \n ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-thump. *** \n \n I stopped, stock-still in my tracks. \n \n \u201c No. \u201d I whispered. \n \n One of the ceiling panes dragged back, revealing a grotesque figure still covered by the blood of the once great Nordsman. \n \n \u201c You will pay for what you did to Zarkaz, vile creature! \u201d Mariah pulled out her knife and charged towards where the creature dropped from the ceiling. \n \n I didn \u2019 t watch it, but I heard it. Mariah\u2026 Mariah\u2026 \n \n \u201c She \u2019 s dead. \u201d I whispered, clambering backwards and under a nearby stack of boxes. \u201c I \u2019 m all alone and\u2026 And\u2026 \u201d \n \n The creature sniffed at the air, multiple holes opening and closing at once with sickly ichor. \n \n ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-thump. *** \n \n It stood before me, all twisted curves and strange twitching mouths and claws. I could have sworn that it smiled at me, that suckering, porous mouth getting closer and closer. \n \n Well. Pride leaveth before the fall and all that. \n \n \u201c Help! Someone help me! Please! \u201d I screamed into the red fringes of the room, hoping, pleading, praying that someone would come. \n \n The air vibrated with a strange tenor. The room suddenly came awash in a strange green tone. The boxes whirred and vibrated with newfound power, suddenly awoken from their deep slumber. A deep, mechanical voice sounded, coming seemingly from nowhere. \n \n \u201c *Stage three nuclear amalgamate detected. Server integrity and human integrity threatened. Human in stress. Eliminating. * \u201d \n \n And with a sudden flash, and a bang, it was gone. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A shrill cry pierces the air ...\n","story":"A Zealot was the first to die, an arrow the size of a small spear impaling him clean through his chest. \n \n He fell to the forest floor, his boots kicking in the mud and moss. More arrows flew out from the trees, striking down another dozen of the faithful. Priests and other officers shouted orders to their units, shouting prayers of protection over their flocks. A block of Temple Flameguard with their heavy shields and flame spears placed themselves between the rest of the column and the incoming fire, forming a shieldwall against the raining arrows. It had the proper effect; despite the power of the arrows they found no easy purchase in the wall of steel, though here and there a spearman was rocked back by the brunt of an arrow's impact. \n \n Corvinus, the Creator's Blade was already moving to aid the beleaguered vanguard, pushing forwards with his warjacks and a handpicked phalanx of Knights Exemplar. His Vigilant led the way, its towering fist-mounted shields forming a moving bulwark. His Vanquisher and Repenter followed behind, the flails held in their right fists swinging with each ponderous, earthshaking step. \n \n Corvinus sensed movement in the trees, and directed his Vanquisher mentally towards it. The heavy warjack turned and fired its Flame Belcher cannon at the motion. He was rewarded with the sound of primal screams and the unmistakable noise of metal ripping through flesh. Loaded with Menoth's Fury, a liquid distilled from the crude oils found beneath the earth, the Flame Belcher's shell ignited everything it touched. A pair of monsters clutching bows taller than a man stumbled from the trees, writhing and flailing as they were consumed alive by the fires. \n \n `` Tharn!'' Corvinus cried. `` Worshipers of the Wurm!'' \n \n As if summoning Menoth's most hated foe, a score of the bestial savages charged out of the trees, clutching axes as tall as a man or else those lethal bows with their jagged blades fixed to the limbs. Their howls and roars would have terrified lesser men, but the Sul-Menites knew that was no fear unassailable with faith in Menoth. Knights Exemplar counter-charged the Tharn, the forest path devolving into the blur of steel and bodies. One unfortunate knight had his body nearly split in half by an ax, only for the victorious Tharn Ravager to die under the slashing blades of the slain Exemplar's comrades. \n \n Corvinus' Repenter opened up with its flamethrower, a billowing cloud of Menoth's Fury consuming four of the beasts. Their screams were almost loud enough to be heard over the roar of the flames. Another Tharn tried to charge the light warjack, and was rewarded with the Repenter's flail caving in its chest. Bones splintered under the blow and the Tharn was knocked back gurgling frothy blood and flecks of white. \n \n The Sul-Menite warcaster threw himself into the thick of the fray, dodging past blade and axe whilst carving him own bloody path. His glaive, *Ira*, had been blessed by Visgoth Ark Razek himself. Every fold of its blade had been done with prayers to the Lawgiver, imbuing it with a deadliness unmatched by lesser weapons. The notoriously tough Tharn found their thickened hides pierced by his glaive, their blood unable to clot as it poured out of their wounds. \n \n His Vanquisher was making a path of its own, its massive flail swinging through the ranks of Wurm-worshipers. Smoke billowed from its stacks, the cloud hazing the battlefield as it strode forwards. A crippled Tharn, its spine snapped in half, tried to crawl out of the warjack's path. It was crushed beneath nearly ten tons of steel and bronze, ground deep into the mud. \n \n Together, he and his three'jacks advanced as one, forming a wedge of steely death for the rest of the Sul-Menites to advance behind. Zealots lobed burning hand grenades over the warjacks, the bombs detonating within the Tharn's ranks. Corvinus' Vigilant endured the blasts, bits of shrapnel bouncing off its tall shields. The four weaved together, blocking and striking in sync with one another. The Vigilant would block a deadly slash of a Tharn's axe, allowing Corvinus to slice through the beast's throat with a flick of his glaive *Ira*. The Vanquisher would swipe with its flail, and the Repenter would finish off the rest. \n \n Any thought of an easy victory was crushed by the sound of more howls.... hundreds. Mixed in with them were deeper, more primal baying. A flood of alien emotions rushed past Corvinus' mind, each slavering and shuddering the same terrible thought. *Hunger. Thirst. Blood. * \n \n The rest of the enemy had arrived.\n"}

Bobbing his head to a tune that does n't exist, he stares blankly at a screen without sound, color or picture, waiting for the commercials to end. The cogs in his mind are dulled, broken and out of place from years of use or misuse one can not say, all that remains is a dark void filled with a single voice that attempts to find some reason or order in the young man's day. \n \n \u201c What do you think you're doing there, huh? \u201d The disgruntled voice asks as he pulls the cord to a single light in the dark space of the man's head. \n \n \u201c I'm waiting for the show to come back on. Commercials are boring and this channel is stupid. \u201d he responds, throwing the remote through the screen. \u201c I'm going to go watch the outdoor channel now. \u201d Blockhead continues, rising from his seat. \n \n \u201c What do you mean, outdoor channel? You can't-Oh, no. No. You remember what happened the last time you went outside? \u201d the old man asks, sitting in a small green chair surrounded by numerous empty alcohol bottles. \n \n \u201c Mm-Hm. \u201d he says, shaking his head vigorously upwards and downwards. \u201c We played chase with the mail man. \u201d \n \n \u201c No, he was trying to run away and you were chasing him on all fours with a pack of stray dogs. \u201d his conscience replies, a deep look of disgust settling on his frowning face as the young man smiles knowingly. \u201c Listen. Do not go out that door, do you hear me? Stay inside and play with your tongs or something. Just do n't go outside. I'll be right back. \u201d \n \n The old man stands, wiping long silver hairs from his dingy white shirt and walks off into the recesses of the young man's mind. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to leave the house, Blockhead exits through the window, obeying the instructions of his conscience within some small measure of reason. He lands with a thud atop a pile of broken glass, seemingly uninjured as he rises and dusts himself off. \n \n \u201c Mmm. Candy. My favorite. \u201d he exclaims, picking up a rather large shard of glass and eating it. \u201c Let's see what adventure I can find today. \u201d he mumbles through small bits of broken glass spewing from his mouth. He begins making periodic beeping noises as he turns his head, rapidly increasing in pace until spotting two students walking along the sidewalk. \n \n \u201c Field Trip! \u201d he yells, spilling the remaining pieces of glass onto the ground as he rushes over to follow behind the two. The unknowing trio continue walking for several blocks before reaching a large brick building with a small granite sign on the lawn. Curious as to the contents of this sign, the strange man stops as the other two continue on and into the building, pressing his face against the cool stone sign he reads aloud, \u201c M. Swain Center, Memorial Library \u201d. \n \n \u201c Hmm. \u201d he says, raising from a half-horizontal position, bringing his hand to rest on his chin as he had likely seen someone else do when lost in thought. \u201c That sounds like... fun. \u201d he muses, walking up to and entering the building, the door closing behind as his conscience returns with another bottle. \n \n \n \u201c Oh God, what did you do? You went outside did n't you? \u201d the old man asks, his palm firmly colliding with his forehead. \u201c You did, did n't you? I was gone for all of a few minutes and now we're... here. I do n't even know where here is. \u201d he says with a sigh, opening the bottle early and taking a drink. \n \n \u201c M. Swain Center, Memorial Library \u201d Blockhead recites proudly as a young woman dressed in a bright blue blazer and skirt approaches him. \n \n \u201c Yes sir, We have the largest selection of books and media in the state. \u201d she begins with a smile as the yellowed man freezes. \u201c Is there anything that I can help you with today? \u201d she says as her eyes focus on the man's appearance. \u201c A-Are you alright, sir? \u201d \n \n \u201c Just act natural! \u201d the old man yells in a panic, seeing that Blockhead has grown tense. The young man attempts to speak before the voice in his head interrupts once more, \u201c On second thought, do n't act natural. You do n't know what natural is. Just-Just get out of here. \u201d he commands as the nervous man darts past without another word. \n \n Unable to respond, the young lady watches as he dashes out of sight, turning abruptly into a room marked \u201c story time \u201d. Blockhead gazes upon the children gathered in a semicircle around an adult, listening as she reads from a picture book. He continues forward, joining the group by pushing two children over to make room. Sitting with his legs folded, he joins in with the \u201c ooh \u201d s and \u201c ah \u201d s of the captivated crowd. \n \n \u201c Good. Now, just sit here quietly and we'll go home after the story is over. \u201d his conscience acquiesces as Blockhead listens patiently to the story. \n \n \u201c This story is stupid. \u201d Blockhead complains angrily, grabbing the book from the adult's hands and tearing it into confetti which rains down upon the children who begin to cry and wail. \u201c That's better. Story time is fun. \u201d he says, knocking over several children as he dashes out of the room, several upset parents in tow. \n \n The parents, the reader, the young lady, and children all attempt to follow Blockhead through the library as he makes train sounds and continues running through the aisles before slipping away in the maze of bookshelves. They continue searching as he loses himself in the colorful surroundings, the smell of worn pages and leather as he scans the book titles for one that piques his interest. \n \n \u201c You-you know how to read? \u201d his conscience asks, genuinely surprised and moderately impressed. \n \n \u201c Mm-hmm. \u201d Blockhead responds quietly, reaching for a dark blue book with golden lettering, the title \u201c Moby Dick \u201d boldly emblazoned on its front and spine. He opens the book and begins trailing a finger across its text, turning the pages and making noises of understanding as the old man watches in amazement. He then tears a page from the book, stuffing it into his mouth before chewing and swallowing it. \n \n \u201c Tastes like fish. \u201d he determines as the angry horde finally catches up with him. They charge at him from both sides as he raises a single finger to his lips and makes a shushing noise that brings them to a crawl. \u201c Quiet! This is a library. The nerve of some people. \u201d he whispers to them and to himself, returning the book back to the shelf forcefully, setting off a domino effect as he escapes in the chaos. His conscience watches on in absolute silence, completely stunned. \n \n Sitting on the purple couch once more, Blockhead stares at the television as he plays with his tongs. He continues this charade until his conscience can will himself to speak, to say anything that might have some impact, that might make him think about the consequences of his actions. He exhales sharply, giving up on the idea entirely before settling on his usual response. \n \n \u201c So, did you have fun today? \u201d he asks as the words \u201c The End \u201d fall from Blockhead's mouth in reply. \n \n -023 \n \n ( This story is largely based off of the Blockhead series by Michael Swain, a.k.a TheSwain.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The Hate Factory\n","story":"What drives a being to anarchy? What in their lives causes them to see the very order that protects and guides them as something terrible and worthy of destruction? Those were the thoughts that troubled Senior Commander Blaze Veron as he stood on the deck of the *Vigil*-class corvette *Antagonizer. * The 255 meter long ship was built in the iconic dagger profile common to the Galactic Empire's powerful Star Destroyers, its pale grey hull blending in with the similar colored armor of its larger brethren. \n \n The command deck sat flush with the hull directly above the massive banks of ion engines and provided greater protection than the more exposed towers on other Star Destroyers in battle. Six light turbolasers sat in a trio of turrets on the upper works of the corvette, their long tapered barrels deadly silent. Another half dozen heavy laser cannons were also placed on the dorsal surface, their greater rate of fire making up for the comparatively weaker damage output whilst a series of tractor beam emitters stood ready at the bow to ensnare any enemy ship that dared veer too close. \n \n The *Antagonizer* carried within its hull over two hundred men and women and in emergencies carry twice that amount. From his position just behind the conn, he stared out at the Rebel fleet arrayed before him. Even from this distance he could see the smooth, aquatic features of the Mon Calamari cruiser that anchored their battle line. A few former Imperial *Nebulon-B* frigates flew in the shadow of their larger sister ship, testimony to the deviousness and underhanded tactics the Rebels used to fill their fleets. Whether they were stolen, salvaged or else handed over by mutinous crews the frigates had come to be a boon to the nascent Rebel Alliance, and a perpetual thorn in the side of Imperial officers like Veron. Other ships could be seen from the scanners, gunships and corvettes and the like. Veron paid close attention to them above all else; they were his likely opponents in the coming fleet action, an intimate dual whilst the titans slugged it out around them. \n \n Lieutenant Gailia Hornigold stood some paces away looking over the engineers report on the deflector shields. Her blonde hair was drawn back into the serious braid just short enough to be within regulations, the four red and blue squares on her left breast denoting her rank. As first officer she preformed her duties brilliantly and Captain Veron noted it as such in his reports, but something about her was... off. Veron chalked it down to subtle feelings for her as so banished them from thought. It was best not to go down that path. \n \n His second officer and astronavigator Lieutenant Jacen Thurlo stood towards the back of the command deck with very little to do. Unless their forces had to flee into hyperspace, which was unlikely, his tasks on board were rather limited. Veron therefor assigned him as a `` morale officer'' during combat, his only goal to appear calm and cool in even the worst attack. The captain and XO had to snap orders at any moment and the gunnery officer's attention was fixed on his gunners, the pilots and communication enlisted therefore needed someone they could glance at and know there was nothing to be afraid of. \n \n The chief engineer was not on the command deck, nor would he be. Commander Elan Anson was practically mated to his engines, fussing over them like a mother bird over her chicks. But he was good at what he did, and Veron tolerated any eccentricities from his CE. \n \n The third officer and the ship's gunnery officer was Lieutenant Kalvon Mer, a rather young looking man from Eriadu. Graduated from the top of his class, the quiet spoken officer was practically a shadow presence-wise. He hardly said a word unless spoken to and during officer's mess tended to remain in the background. Veron regarded him with a slight bit of pity. It must have been difficult growing up if he was always like that but then Mer was a born gunnery officer. In the heat of battle any shyness evaporated and was replaced by a decisiveness unmatched. More than once he gently push aside a gunner to make a shot himself, the blast knocking out shield generators or else the tractor beam capturing the fleeing smuggler. A raised voice from the comm reader recaptured his attention. \n \n `` Captain Veron, sir. Admiral Gesiks of the *Vanguard* has order the fleet to deploy. We are to form up on the *Reaper* and screen its advance.'' \n \n Captain Veron nodded and smiled grimly at the enemy fleet ahead of them. \n \n `` Very good, tell him the message is received. Sound the alarm, prepare for battle.''\n"}

The tinny voice of the sales-woman repeated to me in a bored tone. It was as if she repeated this line on a regular basis, which frankly seemed quite stupid.

I had n't heard of that making much difference before, the reviews I found seemed to vary greatly in reasoning with no issues with the company. But could I be the first? I wanted a bit of success, thats all. Luck, more than success really. I've heard it's more worthwhile to go for luck, less loopholes to bite your arse. And is wanting luck, especially with the ladies, such a bad thing? \n \n These days the women are so picky. Especially if you've had any sort of... heterosexual....interests.

As I started to worry I'd gone too far and angered Her she started to speak softly. \n \n `` The..uh... the stars.'' \n \n `` What?'' I exclaimed again. `` I ca n't hear you.'' \n \n `` The stars.

They are n't in alignment.'' \n \n \n I had no answer to this... this... ludicrous excuse. The stars? This is n't the Inca fucking Empire! The stars are n't even used! What am I, baby flipping Jesus now? Selling my soul to the three wise men? Oh please give me more stupidity. \n \n `` You're lying. Stop lying and buy my soul!'' \n \n Another pause, and an extremely weary sigh. \n `` Look, Erin. I really hate to tell you the truth but I see no other way around it. You do n't have any sort of soul for me to buy. Otherwise you'd be happily lucky already. There, now thankyou and goodbye.'' \n \n `` Wait wait wait! No soul? But how? I'm sure I have one! Everyone does!'' This was beyond belief. No soul? No way. \n \n `` Not everyone. I'm afraid the only way for you to sell your soul, is if you steal one first. I can connect you to the appropriate department if you'd like though.'' \n \n I stood in uncomprehending silence for what felt like an eternity. No soul. I had no soul. What was I meant to think about that? We're taught at a young age that everyone has a soul, otherwise you're dead. Thats just how it works, and now I'm finding out that thats wrong?

I could jump in front of a car. Alright Sara, I'm coming for you... \n \n `` Wow, Do n't you get tired of doing this after 12 years?'' I turned to see a little girl with a winged Helmet. \n \n `` Are you lost, little girl?''

Liz, Debbie and Paula all had a different look in their eyes. Liz had a touch of amusement in her eyes, Debbie was more disgusted and Paula looked like she wanted to kill me. The three girls had all one thing in common: at one point, we almost had sex but it never happened for a reason. \n \n When I entered the pub, Liz and Debbie, who were drinking a beer, waved at me to come with them. And a bit later, Paula entered the pub, saw us and went to taunt me with: \n \n `` Hi Rick, are you sure you want to disappoint those girls? They look too nice for you.'' \n \n Liz and Debbie looked surprised but quickly Debbie said `` It's a bit late anyway, I already was disappointed'' \n \n `` Oooh? What do you mean?'' Asked Liz and Paula \n \n `` We were having a nice time but Rick never went to the end, nor started actually'' \n \n `` That's funny, because I also almost had sex with him before he turned out a jerk and I stopped'' said Paula \n \n `` No way!

I was still a virgin at the time, but at one point, I decided to lose it and tried it with a douche called Anthony, it went wrong and was frustrated. Less than 2 months after, I ended up at Rick's home and during the foreplay, Mister Rick judiciously said `` I'm sure you're wetter than with Anthony'', which made me lose everything'' said Paula, making Liz and Debbie laugh. \n \n `` Ahahah, indeed Rick, you were a douche! I remember the time we almost had sex. We were in a frat house bedroom getting it on, and he called me another name. When I told me that my name was Debbie he said `` Debbie? Fuck I'm so drunk, I ca n't even aim the girl I deserve and aim lower...'' I slapped him and got out of the room'' \n \n `` Hahahaha! That's hilarious! But you know, girls, I was n't disappointed like the both of you. For me, it was more of an accident that stopped our sex session'' Said Liz \n \n `` An accident? What happened?'' \n \n `` Well, Mister Rick drank a little too much and when he got in bed, missed the bed and fell. He struck his balls on the corner of the bed and bumped his head against the nightstand, sending him to the hospital. That was hilarious, you know!'' \n \n The most embarassing moment of my life was about to finish when Liz said with a wink \n \n `` You know, I think, you should stop drinking that much, it's bad for your sex life.

You had found yourself getting up early because some prat decided to get himself killed in from of your apartment complex. The sirens had started at about six in the morning and hadn \u2019 t stopped by midday. Luckily you didn \u2019 t have to come in today, otherwise you couldn \u2019 t have stayed in bed. After browsing Reddit for a few hours on your phone you had somehow ended up on one of those crappy \u2019 10 things you need to know about losing weight \u2019 websites. You \u2019 re too bored to give a toss so you decide to read the article anyway. You try to stab yourself to death with it, but it \u2019 s too dull. Quickly you forward to the next article, but surprisingly it \u2019 s equally disappointing. With a sigh of disbelief you decide that it \u2019 s time to make something of your day. As you get up and walk towards the kitchen you cast a look out of the window. Yep, they were still cleaning up the pavement. \n With a complete lack of appetite you start your breakfast annex lunch. While the food is sliding down your oesophagus you continue browsing the crappy website. You read a couple of more \u201c articles \u201d. One of them offers a mindreading tool. Without giving it a proper thought you download it. It gives an error: \u201c this format is not supported by your device, please try again later. \u201d By the time you \u2019 re finished eating you \u2019 re so fed up with all the drama going on outside that you tell yourself to get out of the house. Somewhere you feel sorry for the bloke outside, but it doesn \u2019 t quite compensate for the lack of sleep. Your clothes itch more than usual when you slip them on. It annoys you. You feel like Oscar the Grouch when you step out of the door. Hopefully your friends place isn \u2019 t a suicide hotspot as well. \n \n Luckily your friend lives in one of the better parts of town, but that also means that the trip there takes quite a bit of time. You want to check the time on your watch, but are only greeted by the sight of your skin. Hopefully your watch is having a better time than you wherever it \u2019 s hanging out. As you arrive at your buddy \u2019 s place you notice that there \u2019 s a great deal of cars parked nearby and something that looks like a fallen-over patio heater is resting next to the bicycle rack. O wait, someone tipped over the bikes. You \u2019 re forced to forcibly remove some of the bikes to make your way to the door. Before you knock on the door it is opened by some pissed bloke. He embraces you with more brotherly love than you \u2019 ve ever experienced and doesn \u2019 t seem to be letting go anytime soon. Quite awkwardly you stand there and after a couple of seconds decide to hug the bloke back. \n \n As it turns out, it \u2019 s some day of national celebration you had forgotten about all together, but it doesn \u2019 t really matter. Your friend invites you in and asks you where you \u2019 ve been. You make an excuse of some sort as you realise that your friends invitation was still lying unopened on your desk, along with all other mail from last month. The party is quite nice actually. Most of your other friends are there too and you have quite a good time. You do what friends do at parties: get hammered, take pictures, get some shots, play some daft games, do more shots. Some of your friends fall amidst the battle, but you handle drinks quite well for your size. You also don \u2019 t feel like being dragged home. \n \n The party lasts until the following morning, but you leave somewhat early as you don \u2019 t feel like cleaning up after yourself. The city isn \u2019 t as quiet as it normally is, for there are plenty more people going around pis drunk. After a while you get bored of watching the completely arseholed tossers bump into each other and take out your phone. Your whatsapp is loading quite a lot messages and images from the party. You decide to look through them to make sure you don \u2019 t look more unflattering than usual. This is unfortunately the case and you pray that they don \u2019 t end up on facebook. Also your whatsapp must have updated again, because there \u2019 s a feature you haven \u2019 t seen before. There \u2019 s a tiny button near each of the face in the picture. Upon closer inspection, you make out the word \u2018 read. \u2019 You press it, out of mere curiosity. Nothing. You check the other photos and find more buttons. You set yourself the challenge of hitting every single one of them, but get bored after a while. You go back to watching pissed up people bump into another. \n \n You were messaging your friend that the party was top when you got to your apartment door. You fumble with the keys as you finish your text. The phone slides into your pocket when you finally manage to open the door. After an appropriately dramatic pause your keys hit the ground. Your apartment is absolutely stuffed with books in black binding. At some point in the not so distant past the appeared to have been neatly organised, but whatever system had been in place, it had all had come crashing down. The only evidence left of this organisation came in the form of the somewhat straightened piles lying everywhere. It \u2019 s unclear where exactly they had originated from, but it must \u2019 ve been somewhere near your printer because the pile was largest there. You \u2019 re too surprised to act upon any of this, but you manage to notice that one of the books nearby has a red note on it. With the utmost care you pick it up. The book is fairly heavy, and in large black letters it reads \u201c Neville Orson Bedfordshire \u201d. As far as you can recall, you don \u2019 t know this poor soul. The note was more interesting. Some idiot had written with red marker on the red note. You squint, but you can \u2019 t quite make out the words. Something about a manufacturing issue. Then it occurs to you that you might turn on the light. You try to navigate your way back to the door, but you trip and fall on your back. The books break your fall, but it still stings more than you would like it to. The book you were holding fell in strange way, causing it to open. In large black letters it reads \u201c Could I wrestle a bear? \u201d You work yourself upright and pull the book toward you. The next line reads \u201c Yeah, I bet I could wrestle a bear \u2013 oh, norks. \u201d Before you can continue a dim light appears in the corner of vision. It \u2019 s coming from your window, probably a lamppost. The interesting thing is the book, it illuminates.

I was to learn later on that what I considered normal, others thought was extraordinary. \n \n The wind has always followed my every whim. I would ask it to change direction, stop, or grow in intensity and it would. There was no one to teach me how to do this but myself. \n \n It was a tiring endeavor however. One simple request felt like I ran a long time except my legs would n't feel tired and my lungs would n't burn. \n \n As with all childish notions, I grew out of the belief that I controlled the wind. Still, one incident haunts me. I try not to think about it and most of the time I am successful. It is impossible to escape the past however. \n \n Years ago, I was in one of my elementary classes. The wind had been unusual, ominous really. It was like a warning. No one else noticed, so I thought nothing of it and attended class as usual. Midway into her lesson, my teacher was interrupted by [ sirens ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=GVz6lEe6s9g ). There was a fear in her eyes, but she tried not to let it show.

The lights went out. Screams were barely audible at this point. The whole building was shaking. I closed my eyes, covered my ears, and willed it all to go away.

Everyone was always tuned to this channel to listen to his horrifying shrieks for 3 days every week. Not that they had much of a choice. It was Hell, after all. The newsdemon, adjusted his tie and shuffled his papers. \n \n `` Up next, we have a very special guest. Those of you from the fifth ring may have heard of him, let's give a nice round of applause to Anger Management leader, Lee Davis Bananthony!'' \n \n Lee Davis Bananthony was a tiny character, standing no taller than the newsdemon's cloven, blazing foot. His bald head had tiny little nubs where most other demons would have horns, and he wore a suit that looked just barely too big. He shuffled determinedly onto the set and fluttered his impish wings onto the newsdesk, where an equally tiny chair was waiting for him. \n \n `` Welcome to HNN, Mr. Bananthony.'' the Newsdemon said, with just a hint of condescension in his voice. \n \n `` It's a pleasure to be here.'' Nodded Bananthony. \n \n The Newsdemon clicked his pen vigorously. Across the scape of hell, millions of viewers felt a wave of discomfort associated with the distracting clicking. \n \n `` So, Mr. Bananthony.'' began the Newsdemon. `` You've been working anger management in the fifth ring of hell for...'' \n \n `` Approximately 1,000 years, yes.'' Bananthony spoke without missing a beat. It was very clear that, despite his incredibly tiny stature, he was a very determined individual. \n \n `` Incredible! And we've seen a lot of change during that tenure, most of it for the better. It says here that you led an infrastructural update on the River Styx. to get it back to the pristine, ghastly state that it once was.'' \n \n `` I did, yes.'' Began Bananthony. `` You see, about 80 years ago, we saw a large influx of souls entering hell, and most of them have to cross over the river. The ferryman could only take one, maybe two across at a time, while the rest of the souls were left waiting for several years at a time. An incredibly huge backlog. My political opponents would tell you that these souls ended up in hell in the first place, and they deserve no sympathy.

And it is constructed entirely out of the bones of unbaptized children, so you know that we spared no expense on making sure it does n't collapse.'' \n \n `` Incredible. So you're saying you had a big announcement to make?'' \n \n `` Yes.'' Bananthony adjusted his tie. `` I've done what I could in the fifth ring of Hell, but my jurisdiction only ends there. I want to see to it that the entirety of Hell is run properly, and people are tortured to full efficiency. For instance, did you know that, in the Second ring, there are still souls being tortured for being gay? In 2015! God said he's okay with that not too short of a time ago, when he influenced the mortal minds in the American Supreme Court to legalize it across their country. We are spending unnecessary resources in tormenting people who by all accounts did n't do anything wrong. We could be better allocating those resources; pitchforks, branding irons, whips and ball gags -- to punishing rapists, or shipping those resources into the 7th circle for punishing war criminals.'' \n \n Bananthony was on a roll, he was n't stopping. `` My opponents will tell you that my efforts will only result in a thicker layer of bureaucracy in hell.

Bananthony stood up from his tiny chair. a small amount of smoke billowed from his ears. `` My name is Lee Davis Bananthony, and I am running for President of Hell!'' \n \n `` I'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr. Bananthony. It was a pleasure having you here.'' Said the Newsdemon as he shook Bananthony's tiny hand. \n \n `` Thank you very much, Mr. Rivera.'' \n \n `` Please, call me Geraldo.

That... That was n't really a secret. I did n't really, create... Everything. I am the Destroyer. Everything is your mother, and she has always existed alongside me. I have broken her down into parts; Light and dark, water and land, insect and mammal, igneous and sedimentary. I have created imperfect things from her perfect form, ever smaller, always finite and degrading into nothingness, as you said, a spiral into oblivion. \n \n `` Were we ever one? Oh, possibly. She may have cleaved herself in two to make me. I do n't know if I was always with her. That is the one thing I do n't know. I do know that she was always with me, much like I have always been with you. \n \n `` So you were never the creator at all! You claim to just be a link in the chain like all the rest of us! The Beginning is as much a mystery to you as it is to everything else!'' Satan was so infuriated by the Lords answer that he was squeaking these words. \n \n God pressed his lips together thinly, thinking carefully. `` Just as a carpenter creates sawdust in making a table, I too created detritus in the making of Everything into nothing. I am the creator of the universe, of time and space, of idea and matter, but these are nothing more than the carvings of your mother's flesh. That is all I have ever claimed. I thought the existence of your mother would be obvious. I suppose she is much bigger than you. She is larger than me as well. Why do you think it's taking so long to tear her asunder!? `` the Creator laughed loudly then. \n \n `` As for whether or not I or she were the beginning, she is clearly the beginning and I am clearly the end. And what happens when I finish my task and all is silent? She will build herself back up again I'm sure. If not... well....all the better for me. `` he finished. \n \n `` oh'' the Devil said.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] He waited there for a moment , idle . He stared into the abyss below , searching for something ...\n","story":"He waited for these moments, idle. He sat in his chair with his eyes closed, listening, feeling. The sounds in his immediate vicinity he heard; but those further away, more mundane sounds, he felt. The kind of sound that is only noticeable when they \u2019 re not there. The hum of the traffic on the highway, distant, or the wind rushing through the underpass. He heard the children playing in the park across the way, and the dog investigating various events in the garden by his window. Sometimes the sounds would help him remember. Trigger something that was all but gone in his mind. \n \n Today, he heard someone nearby playing a piano, just a few notes but it was enough. He was back. Back in that empty hall years earlier. All the diners and dancers had left, and it was him and another man left. He was friends with the other man, but the name was long gone from his mind. They were laughing together, and as young men are wont to do, never got too serious. \n Do you play any Bill Evans? He enquired, gesturing toward the grand piano against the wall. His friend replied ahh, Bill Evans is pretty complex but I know a little. The man walked to the piano and pressed a couple of keys. The friend paused at the piano, and looked. Then began playing the first phrase of a Bill Evans piece that he knew. He felt the keys beneath his fingers, the ivory, cool and solid. Evans was the kind of pianist that, through immense effort, became effortless, floating between chords, slipping up and down phrases, in and out of scales. He didn \u2019 t know much of the Bill Evans piece, so before too long he was stretching and augmenting, repeating phrases out of order and back to front. The player, was just playing. And the world, became black and white. Sharp and Flat. Easy. He sunk closer to the keys, long hair sweeping the keys, body swaying. \n \n His friend ended the phrase a note before he should \u2019 ve, and let it hang. Then he stood, gave slight smile, and walked towards the door. The spell was broken. \n The enquirer stared at the piano for a few moments longer. \n \n \u2026 \n \n Before; he \u2019 d thought that discovering that his end was imminent would have changed the way he lived his life, but it hadn \u2019 t really. When he was moved into the hospice there was no realisation of regret, or satisfaction at a life well lived, and at first that troubled him, but pretty soon he realised that it didn \u2019 t matter whether your death arrived in three weeks, or ten years; you still got up, cleaned up, and made a cup of coffee. So, there he sat, in the late afternoon sunshine of a summer day. \n \n Then he heard the children playing again, and he wasn \u2019 t taken back, but forward. \n He heard them squeal as they ran passed on the street outside in the orange evening light. And he raged. The constant involuntary shake of his hand was exacerbated by his fury. His eyes watered with frustration. He raged against his body for slowing and his memory for slipping. His memory, though, had not slipped so much that he was not constantly reminded of what his strength use to be, his speed. \n All this would go on, the children would play in the streets, the dons would play on the weekend, young people would go out drinking and end the night with bodies twisted together. And he would just be there, sitting in his fucking chair. He \u2019 d be there, and then he wouldn \u2019 t. \n \n In the garden outside his window, the dusty air of the hot summer evening rendered the rays of the setting sun that fell through the lavender bush into solid beams of gold. The little dog was still in the garden, chasing its tail, following scents. It ran into a patch of light and barked. It took a step back and looked quizzically at the column of light, seemingly solid, unbend-able. The dog barked again and jumped at the beam mouth outstretched around it. His jaws snapped shut, he crashed to the ground. Almost as he got back to his feet the light visibly receded as the sun set, the darkness increased. His jaws snapped at the light again, attempting to pull it back towards him as it hopelessly slipped away. The dog, kept barking. The sun, kept setting. He just sat in his chair, idle, staring into the abyss below \n\n"}

There was a storm while we were sleeping and a lightning hit right outside the house! The BOOM woke me up, and in the morning there was a long silvery pole, and it was stuck in the ground! I wanted to go play with it, but Daddy would n't let me. About lunchtime, some people in matching clothes came and took it away. I asked Daddy why they took my lightning, he said that the lightning got lost and they were taking it where it was supposed to go. I do n't care, I want it back! \n \n ***** \n \n I went looking for the lightning today. There were a lot of people like the ones who took my lightning, so I asked one where the lightning was. He said that lightning was in the sky. I said I was n't looking for any old lightning, I was looking for MY lightning. He made me take him back to Daddy, and Daddy made me go to my room while they talked. Afterwards Daddy said I could n't bother the men with funny clothes, they were busy. That's mean, I just want my lightning! \n \n ***** \n \n Today, there was one of the men in my school, they were telling all of us to stay inside when we were n't at school and to come tell one of them if we saw anything weird. I asked him if it was weird for lightning to get stuck in the ground, he just smiled at me and said it was n't, but I should n't touch it. I've never seen lightning get stuck before though, so it must be weird, the grown-ups just do n't want me to play with lightning! \n \n ***** \n \n Today was scary. A lot of houses burnt down, and all in a line too. My little sister saw it, and she said that there was a red light that set fire to everything and went in a line from the sky. I asked Daddy what that was and he said it was a star that got too low and brushed against the sky. I'm scared now, what if another star falls and lands on our house? \n \n ***** \n \n There were a lot more of the funny men in weird clothes today, they were going everywhere. I asked one of them if he was looking for lightning, he said no. He said he was looking for a Soulless. He asked me if I'd seen one. I gave him a rock and said it did n't have a soul, and he hit me! He said I'd wasted his time and he made me take him to Daddy and Daddy made me go to my room again and then Daddy told me I ca n't go outside because I was bothering the men, but I helped him! I asked Daddy what a Soulless was, and he said it was a monster that goes around in the night looking for people to eat, but that if I stay inside after dark I'm safe. He said the funny men are like police for monsters and they lock them up so they do n't eat people. Police are nicer though. \n \n ***** \n \n There was a lot more lightning last night, I did n't sleep at all! In the morning, there were lightning bolts scattered all over the town, one totally smashed the house next to us! I tried to go out and get one, but Daddy caught me and would n't let me go outside. I asked my little sister to get some, but one of the funny men brought her back crying. Daddy was mad at both of us, he made us go to our rooms for hours! But the funny men did n't get all the lightning, they missed the one that landed far off behind the backyard. Tonight, when Daddy's asleep, I'm going to go get it! \n \n ***** \n \n I hurt all over, but I have a lightning! When Daddy went to bed, I snuck out the back door he never closes all the way and ran to where the lightning was. It was a long way, but I made it. There was n't a lightning though, just a hole in the ground. I guess the funny men found it after all. I was going to go back home but I ran into a man in a costume! He was wearing these black spiky clothes so you could barely see him in the dark, and he looked like a giant sort of. I asked him why he was dressed like that, he said it was so he could be sneaky because he was playing hide-and-seek. He asked me if I wanted to meet his friends and I asked him if he knew where I could find a lightning and he said he did! He said if I went with him we could go to where the lightning comes from and I could get all the lightning I wanted! Now I'm in a big city and he gave me a lightning and it hurt but he said that the lightning bonded to me and now it's mine forever!

I'm surrounded by zeroes and broken hoes and YOLOs and the more I go through the motions the more I find that no man's an island yet I'm surrounded by oceans of dead fish and salty fishermen and other things I ca n't do anything with except smell and be annoyed at the stinky stench they all produce as I thousand-yard-stare through this bullshit life I'm so tired of living. I have affection to give, and more. And someone out there wants it. Maybe they're in bumfuck Alabama or Lithuania but they're out there, looking, like me, for someone to give them everything I happen to have. But I ca n't fucking find them because I'm paralyzed by too many tries without successes, and brown eyes instead of blue and there's nothing I can do except sit in my apartment and wonder what the future holds and hope it is n't a reservation for one at a one star restaurant with shitty Yelp reviews and a sexy server that makes eye contact I ca n't look back at because I'm Jerry fucking Lewis but more clueless and clumsy and every girl's Dean Martin seems to be a man I never want to be in real life or pretend.

The colonel said, waving to the chair across from him. \n \n `` Sir,'' The private barked, only putting his hand down, `` I'd prefer to stand.'' \n \n Rosario looked up at the private and frowned. He looked young, barely a hair on his chin. Still, there was a gleam in his eyes, a spark of determination. That was always useful. \n \n `` Suit yourself, private.'' The colonel picked up a file and flipped through. `` Private Wallace. Sergeant Harrison speaks highly of you, says you're one of the finest he's trained.'' The private kept his poker face and Rosario nods, continuing, `` Well, do n't think too much of this interview, Wallace. Whether I like you or not, you'll still be going to CT boot camp. Just a few questions, first.'' Colonel Rosario smiled, `` I wo n't make you swear on the Bible, but try to be truthful, would you?'' \n \n `` Sir! Of course, sir!'' \n \n Max volume seemed to be Wallace's default. No surprise considering he came from Harrison's camp. That would need to be ironed out. \n \n `` What's your family like, private?'' \n \n `` Uh, excuse me, sir?'' \n \n Rosario chuckled, `` Your family, Wallace! You have one, right?'' \n \n `` Yes, sir.'' Wallace nodded, `` Just me and my mother, sir.'' \n \n `` No father?'' \n \n `` I've never known him, no sir.'' \n \n Not that Rosario did n't know that already. Still it was good to hear it from the boy's mouth. \n \n `` Ever voted before, private?'' \n \n Wallace kept his compsure this time. `` No, sir.'' \n \n `` Never, huh? Too stupid to understand or too stupid to care?'' \n \n The private flushed with embarassment. `` Neither, sir, I've just... I...'' \n \n `` Fair enough, Wallace. I suppose that was a bit harsh.'' Rosario gave a light laugh and Wallace smiled weakly back. `` We'll move onto the next question. Should be straightforward. Ever had any experience dealing with terrorists?'' \n \n Wallace paused, wondering if he was going to stumble into a trick question. `` No, sir. Not directly. But that's why I wanted to join this unit, sir. Bring the fight to them, sir.'' \n \n `` What do you think of them then? The terrorists, that is.'' \n \n `` They're cowards, sir. Nothing more than criminals gone insane.'' \n \n Rosario nodded. `` Well, that's a strong attitude to take, Wallace. Can you think of anything redeeming about them?'' \n \n The private blinked, his lips pressed tight. \n \n `` You called them cowards, Wallace.'' The colonel smiled grimly, `` There's a truth to that, but at the same time, they have a resolve that most do n't understand. The resolve to die.'' Rosario stared at Wallace, `` I wo n't ask you to throw away your life. But when the time comes, when you face someone prepared to die, do n't hesitate. Oblige them.'' \n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n A dozen voices shouted commands, but one came clearest, `` Put your hands in the air and turn slowly! Do it!'' \n \n The girl complied, her hands coming apart, a grenade in one hand and the pin in the other. \n \n But that was n't what Wallace was watching. He saw her eyes instead. There was terror. She did n't want to die, anyone could see that. More than that, though, was despair. There was no coming back from this. She *knew* she was going to die. \n \n There was even more shouting, but Wallace did n't hear. Wallace squeezed the trigger.\n"}

I mean, yea it's better than that lake of fire I saw while I was down there but the Devil must have been having a bout of inspiration when he decided on my punishment. Hell truly is other people it seems and my new twin Mick is my own personal hell. \n \n Let me back up a moment. I have decided to being keeping this diary to try and maintain what little sanity I have left so let's start with the beginning, ny name is Nick and I'm 7 years old. Well, 7 in this retelling of my life. You see I died 7 years ago and found my soul hellbound for my sins in life. I was n't a horrible person, in fact I did n't even really think I bothered much of anyone while I was alive which is why I rejected it when I was sent to hell. It was Sloth that did me in if you're wondering. No grand sin to damn me, just a million tiny greivances gained over a lifetime that added up to a one way ticket down below ( Well two way in my case... kinda ). In retrospect I kind of get it. I never recycled, bothered to call to cancel appointments, I would drive the speed limit in the passing lane and procrastinated like I was getting paid for it. Hell, even putting my story to page now I ca n't be bothered to fix any of the typos or grammatical mistaked that might pop up ( SOrry grammar nazis ). Although I would say for a 7 year old I'm doing allright. \n \n Anyways back to Mick, my `` new'' twin, or more accurately the embodiment of **MY** slothful nature. You see, I did n't accept that I belonged in hell for my petty crimes. I could n't imagine my tiny thoughtless slights of people over the years could possibly add up to an eternity of hellfire but ho-LY **FUCK** was I wrong! It's only been about a year since my mind has resurfaced from that pre-child sludge from which we all must crawl and I'm already considering killing one of us. This fucker... Mick... he's just so... UGH I do n't even have words for how insufferable he is. The little monster manages to shit all over the toilet seat and leave it for someone else to clean up and the task has now fallen to me because my parents ca n't tell us apart so I've got 50-50 odds for catching an ass whopping on his behalf if I do n't clean up after him. \n \n And it's only been getting worse. He eats everything, he never puts anything away, and he copies over my save files on the ~~n~~ Nintendo. He even steals my friends instead of going out and making his own. It's like I spend every waking hour of my life cleaning up after this little monster and for what? Supposedly if I can drag this freak through life with grace and dignity I can absolve my sins and go to heaven but there's one little hangup in that it was Lucifer who made this promise. Yea, prince of lies and all that. Ugh and knowing how things are going now I am NOT looking forward to puberty... cleaning up his... ugh... \n \n I know I'll never escape him and seeing how successful this torture is I'm sure a suicide will only warrant a reset of this hell. Give me strength diary, I'm going to go and eat the easter egg I stashed under my mattress. So help me god it had better still be there.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Bob does n't realise he 's a robot until he fails a captcha five times in a row .\n","story":"Bob sat down at his desk at exactly 8:30 AM, as he did every morning. He situated the few materials left scattered about his desk from last night \u2019 s hard work until he got them perfectly organized, as he did every morning. His job was mundane and basically one repetitive task after the other until the clock slowly ticked away up to 5 PM. He turned his computer on at precisely 8:35, as he did every morning, knowing it would be fully booted and ready for use at 8:37, as it was every morning. The computers his company used were old and obsolete, he thought bemusedly. No hope for any more advanced computers than this, his mind added. \n Once the computer was fully loaded, Bob set about his everyday tasks. He would examine expense reports and create reports based on those examinations. Travel to and from off-site facilities were approved, visits to that nice restaurant one town over on your lunch break were not. Bob, very focused on the task at hand, rigorously scrutinized every entry from every request he was given. He liked being the one to catch the smallest details, nothing would escape his impeccable eye. That is until he reached an entry, which had no address or details included. \n \n Great, he thought, now I have to research this place online and see if it \u2019 s an acceptable expenditure. He quickly pulled up the website for the company in question, however to gain more information he needed to sign up and register for the website. What kind of company doesn \u2019 t allow the general public to see its contact information? He thought to himself. He sat and stared at the screen for a moment, as he would any time he was faced with a light conundrum, but quickly found himself unable to just leave the site, as he was compelled to complete this report given to him. He needed to know more about this company and this was the only way. \n \n He quickly made a username and password, and proceeded to the next screen, bringing him to a captcha verification page. The page read, to ensure you \u2019 re a human please enter the code given in the image. Easy, Bob thought as the computer slowly loaded the image of a house, the frame pulled up to a gold plated address indicator on the front door of the home. His eyes squinted at the numbers, and he couldn \u2019 t understand why he had trouble reading these numbers. \u201c 5\u2026no 8..5..3..no that \u2019 s not a 3..its a..um\u2026 \u201d Bob felt confused. He decided it best to not overthink this, must just be tired, he had been working a lot, so he just entered the first 4 numbers he believed he saw. \n \n The page reloaded itself, again asking him to verify he is human with a captcha image on the screen. Okay, he thought, that last image was just low quality, I \u2019 ll just get it this time. A picture of a word lightly distorted by static appeared. He couldn \u2019 t understand what this word might be. Bob started growing frustrated. He quickly typed out the word as best as he could make it out but again the page reloaded. This time showing him another image. Bob started to feel hot and perspire, as he tried again and again to input the information given him on the captcha screen to no avail. He could not process that his powers of detail and scrutiny might be failing him, Bob felt really hot now, like he was overheating. The words just kept flashing through his mind. Verify you \u2019 re human\u2026 verify you \u2019 re human\u2026 verify you \u2019 re human\u2026until sparks began to emit from him. \u201c Am I\u2026am\u2026I\u2026I \u2019 m\u2026not\u2026.hu-human? \u201d \n \n IT came to collect Bob when his sensors showed signs of overheating. He could hear them over him, see them scratching their heads, unsure of how to assist. \u201c Well on this kind of budget we couldn \u2019 t hope for any more advanced AI than this \u201d he heard one say, the other nodding in ascent added \u201c Guess it was just time to upgrade \u201d Bob felt the hand on his back jimmy open a small compartment, the hand lingered on a small button as he heard his final words \u201c At least this one lasted longer. \u201d\n"}

I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, I'd be lucky enough to die as soon as I open it. \n *clank* \n \n Nope, no such luck. \n \n Working a retail job is soul-crushing, and it does n't help that I work for a McDonalds\/KFC\/PizzaHut combo with a bunch of self serving kiosks where I'm the only human employee. It could be worse though, I could've been a truck driver last year just as Elon Musk's AutoBahn driverless cars were announced. That would've sucked. \n \n Whatever, I'm home now, time to heat up a frozen pizza in the oven and commence my nightly ritual. \n \n Maybe I'll just order Chinese tonight instead of making pizza?

I think that's how it was anyway, my dad took care of all that stuff. My $ 40 monthly click plan usually lasts though, so I guess it evens out, and it helps conserve bandwidth space by forcing websites to host less pages. Still though, I remember surfing on my PSP when I was 10 or 11, trying to find `` boobies'' on yahoo, my prolific monkey spanking career would've cost me at least a good grand or two before I even entered high school if I paid for all those clicks. \n \n Which reminds me, it's time for that part of the night.

Yeah, one video is fine! People used to use DVDs and stuff, or magazines, I'll just bing search one video, boom, Midget Polyamory Island 5, a classic, and done. I wo n't click anything else. This is fine, I have 13 cents left and I'm, I'm not getting hard. No, this is trash. I need more. Well maybe I'll just, I know! I'll search up Asa Akira. She gets me off in like, a minute.

Alright, compose yourself, return to the video, and finish the job. You know all that stress kinda made me lose interest. Shit. I wonder what Angela from high school is up to these days. Maybe a quick Facebook search... right..Puerto Rico vacation album... there we go. Alright, I'm digging this. \n \n `` WARNING: BALANCE IS NOW 0 DOLLARS AND 5 CENTS'' \n \n Shit, FUCK, I got ta make this picture work, alright, alright. Stay calm. Maybe if I have the picture and the video playing at the same time. \n \n Ok, sweet. This is actually going pretty well. Asa's about to finish, and so am FUCK, I got a pop-up, really? \n \n Oh Christ, it's one of those infinite dialogue pop-ups. Just hit `` prevent this page from creating additional dialogs'', ok.

No sign of where he was. \n \n No memory prior to awakening. \n \n `` Where am I?'' faintly rose from his lips, as he examined the spotless floor. A white color that stung the eyes like the sun would. \n \n Now sitting up, he and took a quick survey of the room. Hoping that something, *anything*, would give him the slightest idea of where he was. \n \n `` Who am I?'' now more demanding, he arose to feet only to find what he found on the floor. Nothing. \n \n Feeling defeated he paced the room looking something. What it was, we will never know. *He* did n't even know himself what he was looking for, but was determined to find it. Every inch of the room was inspected hundreds of times over. Banging around to find a hollow spot, whoever put him there must have left some kind of secret door to escape. After what seemed liked hours he finally had enough, found himself a corner of the room that felt the most comfortable even though they were all identical, and sat down. \n That's when he saw it. \n \n *Dean. * \n \n A tiny note card bearing the name in pen written with an almost elegant hand as if someone spent time making sure every curve was as perfect as it could be. Dean. Was it his? Did it belong to the person who left him here? For a moment he thought what Dean could stand for, but later determined it was his name. After examining each letter critically, he flipped the card. \n \n *You are CAT # 9, * \n \n *In this room you do not require nourishment or rest. You will not age and you will not die for whatever the length is of your stay in this room. * \n \n *A door will appear shortly after this card is read. Be warned, the door will decide what your fate is. Life or Death. You will not know what your fate is until the door is open. When you cross the threshold of the door frame you will be free. * \n \n With a sudden groan that seemed to becoming from every direction, Dean felt helpless as the room began to slowly spin. The door that he was promised had n't appeared. The room began to pick up speed and he started to feel glued to the walls. What was this? Some sick joke? Fearing for his life or what he thought was his life, he clenched his teeth and closed his eyes. \n \n The room came to an abrupt halt that almost launched him across the small white box. While slowly opening eyes he saw it. \n \n A door. \n \n Full sprint to it just to slowly touch the door handle. The door seemed heavy, as if the dark oak wood weighed a thousand pounds. \n \n \n `` This it. Life or Death. Maybe I'll know where I am if I live.'' \n \n He took a deep breath, he tried to take all the air in the room and return it as if it was n't good enough to even graze his nostrils. He gripped the handle, it felt foreign to hold it for some reason. Turning it, he grew anxious and quickly pulled to see what the universe had in store for him. \n \n He collapsed as tears fell down his face. He could n't bear to see what was in front of him. \n \n The doorway was layered with bricks and with white paint it read: \n \n *I lied. *\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The human race 's finale episode just aired .

The entire time they have a sign or are telling people the world is going to end but no one listens to them. Even in some of the darker moments of the series I liked how they were used it to give us an idea oh how the show was going to end. \n \n The political satire was repetitive but well done. In the end humans need to have a dictator in charge to be able to run a nation effectively. The biggest problem was when they allowed for group decision. Initially it worked well but over time corruption destroyed the system and eventually a singular leader would rise and take control. What would make sense it to bread a class that would be the leader of men. This was attempted with kings and queens but it was n't until the understanding of genetics that they could really pull this off. Instead of trying to have people who are bred to be leaders they still tried to have a democratic system. As I said this was repetitive but they found new ways of trying democratic systems as well as how they collapse. \n \n Their humanity and compassion as well as lack of made for some of the greatest emotional episodes that we have seen or will see for quite some time.

So nobody even questioned or made a second glass as I walked through to the backyard of the suburban two flat. \n \n I read the note again `` he always leaves the back window unlocked, we took care of the dog'' \n \n Whew, good, I hate dogs. \n \n I moved right in to the wooden porch over looking a huge backyard sprinkled with various toys that were never cleaned up \n \n `` Oh shit Little Jimmy has a kid?'' I whispered to myself as I fumbled with the window. I never remembed Little Jimmy having one while he was with the Sardinos, but life can move fast I guess. \n \n I slipped through the window and into a lavish kitchen. A little too lavish for what I knew about Little Jimmy, but maybe his wife whipped that outta him. \n \n I made a quick check through the house, every room with the fanciest appliance or furnishing you could think off, and I dialed the Bosses number. \n \n `` Are you in'' he said gruffly \n \n `` Yeah, Little Jimmy got straighted up'' \n \n `` Dont matta now, you know what to do. Even if his family is there, hes got ta pay'' \n \n He hung up. But my mind kept wondering. Something seemed strange. I went up stairs a bit more sliently, since I didnt know if anyone was up there, and poked around more. \n \n I walked quietly into the master bedroom, silk sheeted king sized bed engulfing the room which was 40 times bigger than my apartment. He really was living large. \n \n I checked the room across the hall, a pink room filled with cartoon character plushies, and drawings of animals scribbled in crayon. \n \n `` I hope shes at a slumber party or something'' I said to myself. \n \n All the sudden *DOOF* I hear the front door open downstairs and the shuffle of footsteps. \n \n `` Ah fuck, they arent supposed to be home yet'' \n \n I frantically look around the room for a place to hide, and seeing nowhere good. I slid underneath the bed, hiding under the pink blankets that extended over the bed. \n \n The house was of course, huge, yet I could hear the family talking as if they were in the room with me and the stuffed German Sheppard that was under the bed as well \n \n `` Im so sorry you're tired sweetie, did the movie make you sleepy?'' A womans voice said softly \n \n `` Yeah'' a little girls voice said \n \n `` Aw sweetie, im glad we left early, you get a good nights sleep, Ill tuck you in in a second'' said a voice that was totally not Little Jimmy. \n \n `` Who the fuck...'' I said as I double checked the address on my phone. 143 West 56th Street is definitely where I was at. \n \n I punched in the address to my phone. The gps pin flew a bit down the block. \n \n `` What in the hell'' \n \n I didnt have much more time mumble to myself because little footsteps were tap tap taping against the wood stairs, getting ever so louder. \n \n Every tap driving home that I have 5 counts of murder, 6 armed robberies, 3 assaults, and a very long time in jail if I get caught. \n \n The door opened, and the thud of the plop on the bed echoed the weight on top of me. Im not sure how much time passed, but it felt like days. The rest of the house filled with a movie whoever was downstairs was watching. \n \n Yeah... filled the house, like, theres no way this girls falling asleep. Do I shoot my way out? Do I just run? Whaaat do I... \n \n `` Wait'' said that evil, childs voice `` wheres Mr.Snuffles''. \n \n I looked at the stuffed dog next to me, beady dark eyes staring into the void. Please do not be Mr.Snuffles. \n \n I won the worlds worst game show because sure enough, the light filled the underside of the bed. And that blonde pigtailed girl who looked no older than 7 screamed worse than any murder victim Id ever laid my knife on. She turned and ran as fast as her little legs could go. \n \n I raced after her, originally to kill her, but I had enough things to worry about. At the bottom of the stairs, she went left into the living room, I went right towards the kitchen. I kicked open the door to the patio, just over hearing the girl tell whoever that there was a mobster under her bed, and I ran out into the night. \n \n I didnt know what I was going to tell the boss.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A doll you bought at an auction comes to life .\n","story":"Larry did n't plan on bringing new life into this world. On custodial wages, he had just enough to get himself by. The logistics of producing offspring were utterly beyond his means. Besides, Larry was no Casanova, so even finding a willing mother was an insurmountable challenge. \n \n Which is part of the reason he resorted to the sex doll. Larry had never had the opportunity to share a meaningful relationship with anyone beyond those merely platonic ones he had had with his old high school chums. And these were questionably meaningful at best. Now in his forties, he was alone. \n \n It had taken him two and a half months to save the funds necessary for his sex doll. It was an important investment to him. Whereas some men had wives, girlfriends, trysts, Larry had his mail order magazines. It took him a full year to recognize that his need to release his more base desires outweighed his shame at buying a sex doll. One evening, along with an overdue gas bill, he sent out a check to the sex doll manufacturer, Real Flesh Inc. In his barely legible scrawl was written `` Two-thousand fore hundred ninty nine and 00\/100.'' \n \n The doll was a look-alike of his favorite actress, Shelley Long, from Cheers, whom he had masturbated to countless times in his youth, at home while his parents were working. \n \n Having Shelley unwrapped and supine on his musty bed, shortly after her awkward delivery by the postman ( who, through his strange glances had made it clear he was privy to the packages contents ), was enough to start him throbbing. The likeness was uncanny. Life-like. Shelley Long-like. \n \n There was no ceremony. Larry would have liked to treat Shelley like a lady, felt compelled to, but he was more animal than man once he finally had Shelley within his grasp. He tried to contain himself once he had entered the flesh-and by god, was it not real flesh? -but Shelley's christening was short, sweet. \n \n After he came, Larry collapsed upon Shelley's bosom. The release was too strong for Larry to stay on his feet. He swam in seratonin and his own sweat, pooled in the dent in Shelley Long's inverted sternum. Stars swam before his eyes as he heaved long breaths, with his studio swirling around him. Soon the sea in Shelley's breasts became salty with Larry's tears, and his breath made condensation just above her navel, as he heaved, and nuzzled her like a puppy weened from it's mother too soon. \n \n Larry's head began to rise and fall, and this hypnotized him, like a baby rocking to sleep. His lids began to fall closed. His tears ceased, and breathing slowed, matching the rise and fall of Shelley's bosom. As her dainty, manicured fingers soothed his tousled head, Larry's eyes slowly fell closed, until he fell into the most peaceful sleep of his life.\n"}

It \u2019 s the best way to get in from this side. \u201d \n \n \u201c Really? \u201d His son \u2019 s eyes widen, full of wonder at the tower cracking out from between the rocks. \n \n \u201c Indeed we will. \u201d The father \u2019 s eyes linger on his son, distant before he returns to setting up his and his son \u2019 s tent. A small battalion of soldiers accompanies them, all ignoring the father and his son in favor of their own duties. The father keeps an eye on his son as the young boy scampers around, staying out of the way of the troops even though they give him fair berth. \n \n The dinner is loud and raucous, the soldiers seeming quite happy to be much closer to home than the father and son \u2019 s small village. After all, it had taken them over five months to find and get to them and another month traveling so far back to the castle. If his guess was right, they still had a little less than a fortnight before they arrived. \n \n He gets his son tucked in, the young boy exhausted from the trip so far. He had started off full of boundless energy that a month of travelling had worn down to a small nub he could summon up occasionally. The sight of the castle had reignited some of that excitement however and the father was pleased for that. As his son sleeps, the father sits awake beside in him the dark, one hand grasped around the handle of a cheap but sharp knife. He waits in the dark, alert and following every sound like a proper sentry. \n \n \u201c Weisz? \u201d A quiet voice speaks, muffled through the tent, followed by scratching in an attempt to open the tent up. \u201c Weisz? \u201d The father lifts the flap with the knife, it immediately pressing into one of the soldier \u2019 s neck. He \u2019 s alone however, the sounds of their homecoming party much further away. \u201c O\u2014Oi, calm down. I bring no harm. \u201d \n \n \u201c Speak or lose the ability to. \u201d \n \n \u201c The captains plan on slitting your throat this night and dumping your body far enough away that the boy wouldn \u2019 t see it. \u201d The soldier speaks quickly and quietly, Adam \u2019 s apple buzzing off the blade. \u201c They don \u2019 t wish for you to interfere with him any further, you are considered an outsider despite your relation to him. \u201d \n \n \u201c And why do you tell me this? To draw me into a different trap? \u201d Weisz drawls with a sneer on his lips. Too often the soldiers and city folk discounted those living in the wilds, they forgot of the losses they incurred each time something like this happened. Weisz was sure that he couldn \u2019 t kill the entire battalion with just the knife but they would remember him like a bad nightmare for years afterwards. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t approve. They plan to use him as a tool. I want you to live so that he will still have a father. So that he \u2019 s not just a plaything for the royalty. \u201d The last sentence is whispered, the soldier \u2019 s eyes darting back and forth, wide with terror\u2014not at Weisz, but simply at being heard. \u201c I set it up so that you could escape tonight, head somewhere and eventually make your way into the town and eventually the castle. \u201d The soldier reaches into his clothing, much slower after the knife presses closer to his throat, and retrieves a piece of paper. \n \n \u201c And what is this? \u201d The father glances at the paper. \n \n \u201c Hope. \u201d Is the simple response, floating on optimism across the dark tent to Weisz. \u201c There \u2019 s a horse that I can lead you to, they \u2019 ll think I \u2019 m taking you to die. You can flee from them. \u201d He offers the paper to Weisz, looking more passionate with each word and action. \u201c And then come back with this. They will let me know, or someone like me, and I will help you once you \u2019 re in the town. \u201d \n \n \u201c Is that so? \u201d \n \n \u201c I promise on my life, on my children \u2019 s lives. \u201d The soldier nods fervently, nicking his neck open on the knife. Weisz watches a drop of blood run from the small wound. \n \n \u201c You will have to promise me something\u2026 what was your name? \u201d \n \n \u201c Anything. My name is Garrson. \u201d \n \n \u201c Promise me that you will watch my son, Garrson. \u201d \n \n \u201c With my life, I promise. And the lives of my children. \u201d Garrson replies, eyes big and white in the darkness. \n \n \u201c I will hold you to that, because I assure you that if you betray me, I will take all of the lives promised me. \u201d Weisz states and Garrson shivers faintly, making the father give a wry smile. It seemed that the people of the wilds still held invoked fear in the city folk, at least for now. \n \n The father takes his time after dropping the flap between himself and Garrson again. He kisses his son \u2019 s head, promising to the child that he would be back with him soon and to be a good son in his absence. He tucks a hastily scratched out letter into his son \u2019 s belongings, to answer where his father has gone and to counter what the captains would say. \u201c I will be back soon, Kallis. \u201d \n \n Weisz eases himself out and follows Garrson, subtly holding the knife to the soldier \u2019 s side and prepared to gut him if he attempted to betray him. The knife sits right where the gap in his armor should be, a flaw in the chainmail and plate armor. He \u2019 s pleasantly surprised when the horse is standing waiting for him at the edge of camp but is still loathe to sheathe the knife. \n \n \u201c Take him and go, off into the wilds. \u201d Garrson insists, voice still a whisper as he speaks. \u201c Hurry! \u201d Weisz swings up easily onto the horse \u2019 s back, gently comforting the creature as it attempts to shy away. \u201c May strength be with you on your journey. \u201d The traditional sendoff of the city folk and soldiers falls from Garrson \u2019 s mouth, pounding his chest with his fist. The lack of a metallic sound indicates that the soldier had not been wearing armor the entire time. \n \n \u201c Thank you. I wish you strength as well. \u201d Weisz pats the horse \u2019 s neck before urging it quickly away from the campsite and the eyes of drunk, wandering soldiers.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The graduation ceremony at your Magic academy allows each graduate to summon and make a contract with a familiar . You perform the ritual , but you summon a human named Carl .\n","story":"With one last stroke of my brush, I completed the Rune of Kot'th'ha, universal symbol of summoning. The magical ink, which I had prepared earlier that day from assorted plants, pulsed with light, signaling the completion of the rune. I had spent the last few weeks working on this summoning scroll as my graduate thesis at Convergence University of Magic. The place was so named because so many ley lines and other anomalies converged at or around the school grounds. Students could tap into the innate power of the location and use it as a crutch when learning. A great variety of localized magical phenomena occur here, making it a prime spot for researchers. Many spells and rituals that would be impossible under normal conditions can be performed here easily. \n \n Anyway, the summoning scroll was complete. This one was designed for summoning a familiar, a common thesis topic for graduate students. The tiniest details could influence the nature of the being called forth, and it was critical that every summoner pour as much of themselves into the circle for their familiar as possible. In the runes, flourishes and other personal touches to the handwriting are helpful, and the summoning area, typically a series of geometric shapes, has to be visually appealing to the summoner. Every summoner writes their own spell for their familiar; the meter, tone, and wording must all be considered. The duality of chaos and order was a particular specialty of mine, so I had structured my summoning spell around obscure patterns that would appear chaotic unless one knew what one was looking for. \n \n I admired my handiwork for a moment, then went to bed. It was very late; I needed to complete the scroll in one sitting, and it had taken longer than anticipated. I would need all of my strength to pull this off. \n \n =============== \n \n The next day, I slept in. Intentionally. There was nothing to wake up early for, and, as I said, I had to be well rested for the ritual. While I would have to perform the summoning again in front of my professors, to demonstrate my success, the first calling of a familiar was an intimate and personal event. Anxiety over being judged could also interfere with the ritual. As a result, graduate students were allowed privacy for making the contract. \n \n The ritual itself was the easy part; I had spent months of grueling work in preparation, now all I had to do everything as I had planned it. I lit a few candles, then unrolled the scroll on the floor. I pulled a second scroll, far heavier than the summoning one, and laid it on the rolling lectern. That was my chant; since it was far too long to memorize, I would need to read off of a copy. Some sections were standard, others carefully composed from magically powerful words and sounds, and several were simple phrases in various languages I knew that were n't magical, but bore significance to me. Notes on inflection, pitch, speed, and volume were written between the lines, and diagrams and explanations of hand gestures filled the margins. Based on my estimations, this would take a couple of hours to complete. While I would rather not make any errors, chaos magic has the advantage of being unusually forgiving, and sometimes actually works better when small mistakes are made. \n \n I took a moment for introspection; with the amount of time this would need, uninterrupted, I could n't afford to be distracted by hunger, thirst, or the urge to make a trip to the water closet. My breakfast was dense, and would take some time to digest, and I had washed it down with a single glass of water, so I would probably be alright. I took a deep breath, and spoke the first word. \n \n Carrying out a ritual is both relaxing and stressful. On the one hand, ritual magic tends to be complex and drawn out with little room for error. On the other, once you get into the rhythm, the process can be strangely calming, like an extremely prolonged dance. Besides that, the channeled magical energies are soothing and overwhelming at the same time. It did n't take very long for me to lose myself to the flow of the magic and the ritual. It was what I lived for, and still is. \n \n The final word of a summoning spell is the most critical. It seals the ritual, and more importantly, starts drawing the summoned being into this world. It will be the first thing they hear from the one who called them. Most would have gone with an extreme word of power, but I went with a more personal and simple approach. \n \n `` Welcome.'' \n \n I said it in a warm, friendly tone, smiling as I did. That was n't artificial; I had been waiting a long time for this moment. \n \n Every summon breaks through to this world differently. Some materialize from thin air, while others open up portals. A few just show up in a blinding flash of light. There are many, many forms of manifestation besides those, but that covers the more common ones. Mine started as a simple speck floating in the air which slowly grew, curled up in a fetal position, until finally it stretched out and placed its feet gently on the ground. It looked human. That was n't unheard of; many magical beings are human in form, but inhuman in nature. Specifically, though, this one appeared as a small boy, who seemed like he could be no older than ten. \n \n `` Hello,'' he said, looking me straight in the eyes. `` Who are you?'' \n \n `` I am Alan,'' I responded, `` a mage. What is your name?'' \n \n `` Carl,'' was the boy's answer. He looked around, confused, and asked me, `` What is this place? Where am I?'' \n \n `` Convergence University of Magic,'' I told him, `` I called you here. This is your home now. Would you like a look around?'' Standard procedure would have been to go for a more direct approach, and attempt to contract the summon as a familiar immediately, but since I was likely going to be working with Carl for quite some time, I thought I ought to be friendly. \n \n Carl just stood there, seeming completely lost. `` Why am I here?'' he asked. \n \n The question puzzled me, so I gave him the simplest answer. `` I summoned you to be my familiar.'' \n \n Carl just stared at me, and asked, `` Who am I?'' \n \n This was starting to get weird, and I was growing suspicious that something was wrong. `` I do n't know. Let's find out, shall we?'' I said, reaching into my robes for my pocket spellbook. I had plenty of the more basic spells that I expected to use frequently memorized, but it paid to have the more complex or obscure ones ready to reference. I flipped through pages until I reached the chapter on detection and analysis, then located the precision sense spell. It was generally used by researchers to analyze localized magical phenomena, summoned or captured beings, and mystical artifacts. I muttered the incantation and focused on Carl. A lot of information funneled into my brain: blood type, magical affinity and senses, illnesses, emotions. None of that mattered though. Carl was human. \n \n That should have been impossible. Summoning humans is magically impossible. There are very few laws of magic, but those that do exist are absolute. `` Carl,'' I asked, `` Where were you before this?'' \n \n Carl gazed upward thoughtfully for a moment, his brow furrowed, before saying, `` I do n't know.'' \n \n `` Do you have a family? Friends?'' I pressed him with many more questions, but the answer was always, `` I do n't know.'' \n \n A thought struck me. Ignoring the fact that I may have inadvertently subverted a fundamental rule of magic, I had just summoned a child. Assuming he was n't a particularly asocial orphan, someone was bound to miss him. I was too caught up in the scientific implications to consider that. This kid probably had a home, and I needed to get him back to it. \n \n `` Come on,'' I said, `` We're going to the lab.'' Carl obediently followed. Like a familiar. This was disturbing. \n \n ============= \n \n ( Continued in Comments )\n"}

I do n't get to play on the front page, but I do get to play at night. \n \n So, with my job done for the day, I make another phone call, this time to my contact and representative for the werewolves of Haven, Sergeant Gregor. \n \n `` So,'' I say when he picks up with an ever-lovely,'What is it now, Pratt?', `` Each pawn in these murders is one of these new-age vampire kids, right?'' \n \n `` Dead on,'' Gregor replies with his usual gruff voice, now sorta bored and sorta not. This was inching into Facade territory, I could almost smell it as well as Gregor's Were nose could. \n \n `` So, who would be a Rook? A base of operations, you think?'' \n \n `` What I'm thinking,'' Gregor says. `` I do n't play much chess, but rooks *are* castles.'' \n \n `` Bishops? Knights? Queens? King?'' \n \n `` The converter would be a bishop. Or the'recruiter' as the vamps like to say.'' \n \n `` And knights would be a fighter, would n't he? A hitman?'' \n \n `` Probably.'' \n \n `` So, queens? Kings?'' \n \n `` Whoever is running this new vamp operation, I'm sure.'' \n \n `` And who is that?'' I asked. \n \n `` Guess the both of us will have to find that out.'' \n \n Greattt... \n \n `` What's your mind, Pratt? Who dies next?''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Throughout history , eldritch beings from beyond the veil have meddled in our mortal affairs , both directly and indirectly . Write about a historical event with a Lovecraftian twist .\n","story":"I had a dream of a pre-history man. It was unlike the usual dream. What I saw was more akin to a vision: clear and easy to perceive. But I was asleep while I saw what happened. The man was savage and had no weapons but for slightly sharp stones. He had a tribe that he travelled with. They were travellers that roamed the plains for food, but had farms in set locations where they could tend and collect. \n \n But this man I was envisioning had enemies too. He was enemies with man-like things. Neanderthals and other simian species whom the Neanderthals ruled. They constantly fought with each other and this man's tribe was slowly dying out. My vision would flicker like a candle, sometimes. I would see the Neanderthals had black gods that would somehow give them powers and tools. I could not see the things the Neanderthals spoke to in my visions, but I felt sick in my dream. After my vision, I realised that I soiled myself. \n \n So then I slowly watched my far ancestors die off. The man I was following was despairing and was trying to convince his tribe to leave the African plains. His own family had been slaughtered. I numbered only a few dozen or so members in this particular tribe, although I supposed similar conflicts were happening with other human tribes, elsewhere. \n \n Then my vision shifted, and I saw that man whooping and cheering as he ran into his tribal gathering. He told everyone how the Neanderthals were found slaughtered in their homes. Their guts and brains spilled all over the soil. He told everyone that he watched the Neanderthals scream wildly all at once and then began to kill themselves. He told everyone how only the Neanderthals were touched by this death; all their tools and houses were pristine - except for the strewn organs. The tribe had a celebration and stormed the Neanderthal camp. They had a massive bonfire and did some pagan dance as they celebrated the end of their hated enemy. The man and his tribe then picked up the Neanderthal tools and decided to use them as their own. As they did so, I felt the familiar feelings associated with the black gods of the Neanderthals. I saw the tools the man's tribe was picking up and I tried shouting at them to stop, but they continued gathering the tools. \n \n Suddenly a fog appeared and time stopped. And then everything I did not know appeared in front of me. It was invisible to everyone else in my vision. Everything I did not know spoke to me: \n \n `` A COVENANT MADE.'' \n \n I tried to speak but my throat began to bleed as I tried. My eyes were crying, as if the tears could shield me from seeing whatever was in front of my. \n \n The fog disappeared and time began once again. I looked at those ancient men in horror, and then woke up. \n \n I threw myself out of bed and changed out of my soiled clothes. I flung out of the house stripped naked and looked at my town. I looked at cars, bicycles, and fresh grass growing freely; all these advancements of men. Man made these things, we fought for these things. I was assured that this was true. We had scientists and mathematicians figure out what we wanted and our engineers made these things. Our technology did not come from a shape without form, a shade without colour, a paralysed force, a gesture without motion.

Today is April 1 , yesterday you were number 1382947344 , today you are number 2 , right behind your 7 year old son with autism .\n","story":"Before anything, there was the ranking system. The system ranked each person by how productive they were to humanity. It was something the government made with the dawn of civilization, but never released. Everyone was ranked, and white men didn \u2019 t dominate the top 100. They didn \u2019 t want to explicitly tell women and men that they were equal, or that all races were equal- so they didn \u2019 t. It was the best kept secret for years, until someone from the inside leaked the whole list. The country was outraged. People who were doctors and scientists were at the bottom of the list, some of the homeless population was on the top- the whole world order was changed overnight. \n \n People on the top of the list were praised as gods. They were brought to the castle, a now famous mansion that held the top ten most productive people. For all others, they were free to live however they wanted. Of course, your number signified your employment status, and relationship status, too. No one knew what the last number was, so anything under 5 billion meant social death. I, along with my son and husband were at a comfortable 1,382,947,344. My husband was about a hundred over me, my autistic son about a hundred under me. I was happy with our arrangement, as sometimes I went over my husband, sometimes he went over me, but never more than a few hundred. Henry seemed to always stay at 1,382,947,244, exactly. I always figured it was some weird thing with the system, but he was happy, and so were we. \n \n Until April 1rst came around. Henry and I shot up from our billions to number one and number two. We were now the most productive people on the earth- with Henry above me. It wasn \u2019 t uncommon to be ranked below your child, so it wasn \u2019 t exactly a shock, but it still hurt. I didn \u2019 t understand it. My husband, Bill, was still in the billions. He didn \u2019 t shoot up with us. What didn \u2019 t make sense was the fact that Henry and I didn \u2019 t do anything differently than usual the past month. And now all of a sudden we \u2019 re one and two? \n \n \u201c It \u2019 ll be okay, Jack. I \u2019 m sure you two will be back home next month. Get me some souvenirs while you \u2019 re up there, okay? \u201d My husband tried to console me. But I was still extremely anxious about the whole thing. What do they do to them up there? No one ever questioned it, and once a new number one was picked, the old one was forgotten. \n \n \u201c Yeah, \u201d I replied, trying to convince myself. I was worried enough about myself, but what about Henry? His whole routine will be disrupted, and he \u2019 ll have to start over for this entire month. The consistency of his ranking kept him pretty calm- this would ruin him. A knock on the door interrupted my train of thought. \n \n \u201c Mr. Jack Renning? You \u2019 ve seen the report. Please gather your things, along with Henry, and let \u2019 s go. \u201d A gruff voice vibrated through the closed door. I knew that it \u2019 d be quick, so I had packed up everything beforehand. \n \n \u201c Yes, we \u2019 re coming. Henry is- \u201c \n \n \u201c Open the door, sir. \u201d I followed the command, and a burly man stepped right in, and grabbed Henry and I. Henry protested, but the man just shushed him, throwing us both into the backseat of his van. We drove for a long time. The seatbelts around us clacked against the metal of the van, and the man had some sort of classical music playing. Why were the two most important people in the world being treated so badly? I didn \u2019 t understand. Finally, we stopped. \n \n \u201c Out. \u201d The man commanded, and we followed obediently. Around us was desert, with a small house about 20 yards away. It was a comfortable temperature, sure, but it was the desert. There was nothing around here for miles. \u201c This is your home for the next few days. Do not try to escape. Do not try to make contact with others. Either of these actions will be handled with early extermination. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sir, I \u2019 m sorry, but I don \u2019 t understand what \u2019 s happening. I thought we went to some sort of mansion? I don \u2019 t mean- \u201c \n \n He cut me off with a hearty laugh. \u201c I can \u2019 t believe they still feed you that bull! No! You don \u2019 t get a mansion, you get this house. One word, my man. Overpopulation. You think the government would rate people on their productivity, and then actually release that list? Nuh-uh. This is the kill list- the computer picks for us. It \u2019 s based on a lot of factors, but it \u2019 s mostly random. \u201d \n \n \u201c What? \u201d That was all I could get out, horrified by this news. The government had been killing people randomly to stop overpopulation?! And ranking them, making them believe that the more productive they are, the more accepted they \u2019 d be- just to randomly throw them to the bottom, or to the top, to be killed? \n \n \u201c I know, I know. It \u2019 s pretty messed up. I saw my own sister thrown in this hell-hole. And before you ask, yes, I am heartless. Yes, I am a psycho, and yes, I enjoyed seeing her die. We \u2019 re the only kind of people they could trust to hire. \u201d He revealed, reveling in my horror. Henry screamed. I cried. And he laughed, he just stood there and laughed. \n \n \u201c Pick your poison- or not, \u201d he chuckled, presenting an array of weapons, including vials and syringes. \u201c We let the top two choose their way to go, the rest just get a surprise. You don \u2019 t have to pick right now, we like to make the others jealous. We have a few days for them to come. You stay here, until you don \u2019 t. \u201d \n I couldn \u2019 t move a muscle. There was no way out of this. There was no way to save Henry. I just stood there. \n \n \u201c Ooookay. I guess you \u2019 re choosing later, then. I \u2019 d suggest getting to the house. But it doesn \u2019 t matter to me when you die. \u201d And with that, the man turned back to the van, got in, and started it. He revved the engine, did a doughnut, creating a storm of sand, and drove away. \n \n By the time he was gone, I was on my knees, and Henry stood by me, frozen. \n \n They were going to kill us. That was a fact. I needed to save my son. That was another fact, and I \u2019 d do anything to make that happen. I took a deep breath, and got up. I need to save Henry. I wiped the sand off of my pants, and took Henry to the house. \n \n If I was going to die, it would be protecting him. \n\n"}

If the intention of the cubes was to tear the world apart, then they would have been created to do so and have not been inhibited by the nuance of a triggered detonation. Zyntak believed the cubes were not delivered to man as a threat, but as a means for man to finally compromise a shared existence between forces that actively sought to kill one another. \n \n Now with the world \u2019 s surveillance seeking out the real cubes, Zyntak decided that a way to protect them would to make counterfeits. Spread them haphazardly across the world and demonstrate to the world powers that their hunt was folly. They do not even know what the cubes look like. His cubes were black, six inches cubed, and mass produced. He was negotiating a deal with another distributor, a supporter of the cause, this week. Zyntak was touched to see how many people shared his vision, and worked tirelessly to conceal the locations of the real cubes. \n \n He could not talk his friend Jeremy into helping.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Hundreds of years in the future , the internet is rediscovered .\n","story":"The little orange-eyed creature wandered away from the others and went down a steep hill into the forest. Perhaps it thought there would be water down there. Or maybe a plant with fruit. \n \n Its little feet pattered against the dirt, while its oily paws pushed dry brush out of the way. This was the first forest the pack of marlots had encountered in over forty days. Tucked away in the shadows of the ravine, the foliage had escape the harsh radiation of the sun and actually managed to grow quite tall. \n \n It felt nice to be beneath the leaves. It felt refreshing to smell damp soil and bugs and mold. The creature paused in its decent and looked up above its head. Little critters were flourishing everywhere. There was life. And life was always a good sign. At long last, his little tribe of marlots may have found a new home. After the harsh fires that ravaged their old one. After the smoke cloud that ate up their shelters and their way of life. \n \n The creature smiled the tiniest smile and returned to the task at hand. It filled him with pleasure to fantasize about the rivers he might find below. And how he would be the first to find them. He could lead the others there after returning with his harpsack filled to the brim. And they might regard him as a hero. \n \n Then he was startled. A great shadow swept across the ground, right before the creatures feet, and shot off into the distance with such speed as he had never seen before. A flying beast, with wings full of feathers and sharp jaws, took off into the sky at a distance no more than fifteen feet in front of the creature. Clutched in the monster's talons was an animal. An poor, helpless resident of these woods, no smaller than a marlot. \n \n And so our creature became afraid. The sudden awareness dawned on him that this home may not be so friendly as their last. \n \n Still he continued onward, farther and farther into the ravine. More and more the light vanished from the sky. And the trees crept in around him. And he was very much not alone. The forest began to scream at him with the voices of a thousand animals. All of whom had made this land their home. Was there even room for the marlots? The creature had never heard such a cacophony of life before. \n \n But deeper he went. And darker it grew. \n \n Eventually his paws became his primary method for navigation. Both of them extended in front of him like the feelers of a crawly bug. And the creature continued to push brush and foliage out of the way. Until eventually the brush disappeared and his fingers began to touch stone. \n \n Stone. Stone was everywhere. Cold, porous and rough. His little hands pushed against them and traced them with amazement. Never had he felt stones so large and flat before. There was not a crack or a fold anywhere on them. Just large panels everywhere. \n \n It was so dark at this point, that the creature contemplated turning back. But his curiosity was too immense at this point. So his little legs continued onward. And his beady orange eyes squinted at the alien terrain. \n \n Then his paw felt something even more irregular. A bizarre protrusion from one of the stones. A long skinny piece of rock, the texture of which he had never experienced before. \n \n The creature squinted at it. And then sniffed it. And then, making sure no one was around ( as if any other marlot could ever see him in this ravine! ), the creature put it to his mouth and licked it. \n \n The stone piece was smooth and tasted... almost like something out of a river. He could n't quite place it. It was almost... the taste of clay. \n \n The creature pulled on it to see if it would yield to his strength. But it was solid. Perhaps more solid than anything he had ever encountered. \n \n But then as he pulled more, the strange stone began to give. It bent and twisted, far easier that he would have ever imagined. \n \n Then, sending a rush of panic through every bone in the little creatures body, the entire large flat panel of stone gave way and moved as though it were falling away from him. The creature jumped, terrified for its life. Had the stone fallen into oblivion? How could something so solid and full of strength be moved so easily? \n \n The creature pawed for the object. It was not there. Then felt for the ground beneath him, making sure that he was not actually the one moving. But, no, he was still standing there very still. \n \n Then he felt the ground in front of him, where the object had been. Solid ground there too. \n \n The little creature moved forward, making sure to keep paws on the stones at all time, in case one should fall again. \n \n His paw felt something else. Now what was this? A little branch growing out of the stone. \n \n But it was not sturdy like the stone. In fact he found he could move the branch quite easily. Then, suddenly, it happened. \n \n The sun burst forth from the sky above and his surroundings, which had once been so dark, exploded into brilliant light. \n \n He had never seen anything like it. Where was he? In the middle of the strangest cave he had ever seen. Large flat walls on all four sides of him. Little suns hanging from the ceiling like stalactites. And some of the most alien symbols he had ever seen. Clearly someone else had lived here before. Some species that the marlots had never encountered before. Perhaps gods. Or beings from another world. \n \n And in front of him, a big white stone rose out of the ground. He walked towards it. Now what was this? It had the image of a fruit on it. A beautiful image. And a red square peg with a blinking light. He did n't know what it was. But something about the peg compelled him to put his paw to it and push it. \n \n More light burst into the room. And before the creature, on the large white wall, appeared a god.\n"}

Rubbing my eyes almost to complete dryness in order to somehow will myself to kick my legs over the side of my bed, I lay there thinking about the day ahead of me. \n \n First I dreaded the commute to work, at least two hours on the 101 to make it to the Icon offices, and there was that quarterly report due today right at the morning. \n \n Ugh. \n \n I was glad I'd stayed for an extra hour the night before and got it done. The Regional Manager was one to always `` judge on the finished product'', and I did n't want to disappoint. \n \n Lazily leaning out of bed, I took a hot shower, prepared breakfast -- oatmeal -- and eventually made it out the door. \n \n I allowed myself a deep, long inhale. The air this morning was especially crisp. \n \n I clambered into my 1993 Volvo 240 with a slightly worried feeling. Something about the day did n't feel exactly right. \n \n Eventually I had made it to the 101 freeway. Heading north, I knew I would find myself waiting in the traffic for what would seem like an eternity. I mentally prepared to dread my morning, and turned on the radio. \n \n 91.5, KUSC Classical music, the only thing that kept me from absolutely losing my mind while stuck in traffic. \n \n Clearing the top of the on-ramp, I saw something a bit unusual: traffic was flowing smoothly. Thinking I'd perhaps rubbed my eyes a bit too hard in the morning, I leaned closer to the steering wheel and squinted out the window, almost wanting to be wrong. \n \n But what I had once dreamed about -- clear traffic on a Los Angeles morning -- was no longer a dream but a reality, right there before my eyes. \n \n I stepped on the gas. \n \n Arriving at the parking lot, I looked into the window of the ticket booth. The attendant did n't even bother to look away from his internet stream of the last Rams game. \n \n `` Hey chief, how's it going? ``, he asked, reaching for the button to lift the gate. \n \n `` Uh... excuse me?'' I asked, wondering when he started calling the office workers `` chief''. \n \n The attendant nearly jumped out of his seat, and turned back around to stare at me quizzically, as if he could n't believe who was looking at him from the inside of the car. \n \n `` I mean... good morning, Ms. Schaeffer,'' the attendant quickly corrected himself, adjusting his tie as his lips moved. `` I, uh... was n't expecting you!'' \n \n `` You were n't expecting me?'' I replied. `` Did you forget my face?'' I added with a slightly off-put giggle. \n \n Henry and I were friendly with each other. He was a slightly larger black man, with a graying beard and tired bones, and being close to retirement age, every morning was a bittersweet hello for me, as I knew that eventually I would n't have the privilege of his warm smile to start my work day. \n \n `` No ma'am, it's not that! I just...'' \n \n Henry paused, almost physically unable to continue. His forehead, glinting with sweat, immediately gave away his nervousness. \n \n `` Uh let me just open the gate for you, Ms. Schaeffer. It's almost time to clock in,'' Henry stammered out, reaching once again for the button. This time he pressed it, and the gate lifted. \n \n Glancing at the atomic clock that sat on Henry's desk, I saw that it was 8:50 AM. I was almost late. \n \n `` Alright, Henry,'' I muttered. `` Open it up'' \n \n `` Strange,'' I thought to myself, as the gate lifted in front of me. `` Why did n't he expect me today? He knows I'm here every morning.'' \n \n Driving further into the parking lot, I looked in my rearview mirror, and saw Henry's rotund silhouette quickly clambering out of the ticket booth. He quickly reached for his radio and brought it up to his face. \n \n The parking lot itself was, strangely, almost empty. It seemed as though half the Icon employees simply did n't show up to work today. Definitely suspicious. Another dream of Los Angeles materialized into a reality for me. Finding a parking spot was incredibly easy, and I did n't have to fight anybody for a spot. \n \n Stepping out of my car, I walked up to Jesse the doorman, who usually greeted Icon associates with a warm smile and a quick scan of our badges. This time he was huffing and puffing, almost buckled over next to the door, as if he had just run quite a long distance over a short time. \n \n `` Good morning, Ms. Schaeffer,'' wheezed Jesse. \n \n A skinny young kid, Jesse was taking this job to make some money on the side, as he worked on his communications degree at Santa Monica College. This was the only thing making him any money right now. His pockmarked face was dripping with sweat, and his eyes were wide open, as if he could n't believe what -- or who -- he was seeing. \n \n `` Hey Jesse, I see you've been getting some morning cardio in, huh?'' I replied. \n \n `` Ye- yeah that's right Ms. Schaeffer,'' cracked Jesse's voice. \n \n Without another word he scanned my badge and let me on my way. \n \n Something definitely was n't right. \n \n\n"}

I sat on the back porch of my neighbor's house, a lovely chap, and it was time for his annual cookout. Ranbir and his wife Sneha had discovered the ultimate recipe for porkchops some year back ( steaks were off the menu for the Indian couple for obvious reasons ) and every year they invited the neighborhood for a cookout. All of their friends came: Ben and Linda, Australians from down the street, Richard, a Ghanese man, Alex and Kim, 4th generation Americans, Rory, a Scotsman, and Chang, a man from Hong Kong. This was, quite possibly, the absolute worst group of people that could have assembled considering my... curse. \n \n A few months back, on April 21st specifically, I was bitten by an Englishman in the dead of night. As per prophecy, any man bitten by an Englishman in the witching hour of the monarch's birthday becomes cursed. Upon the full moon or the birth of an heir, those afflicted gain odd traits. Extra'u's are thrown into our vocabulary, we have an affinity for using the word `` c*nt'', we watch the BBC religiously, we eat beans on toast for *every meal*, and upon seeing a Frenchman we have an overwhelming desire to spit on their damned, pretentious shoes. \n \n Hours stretched onward as my symptoms became worse and worse. Sneha offered drinks and instinctively I asked for Earl Grey. Bloody hell, Earl Grey. Not Gray, *Grey*. Even in non-written form I knew what I meant; my symptoms would be severe. Of course, I simply could n't leave the party early; that would be awfully rude, and an ironic side effect of the curse was an inability to be rude to hosts. \n \n I went inside Ranbir's house and started to make myself at home. I set the temperature to a nice 24 degrees and started raiding his spice cabinet to help cook my sausage. I was n't even particularly hungry, but seeing the spices I had available I had to keep trying. \n \n `` Um, Lewis?'' Ranbir said behind me, `` What are you doing? Everyone is outside... is that my turmeric?'' \n \n `` Right, right, terribly sorry,'' I said, continuing to cook, `` Ranbir, if it's not a terrible bother, would it be possible to set up a nice game of cricket? I'd be glad to teach everyone if they do n't know how to play,'' \n \n `` Lewis, get away from my stove,'' the host said more forcefully. I turned off the stove and moved my sausage to a nice china plate. Sneha came in from outside, extremely confused as to what was going on. \n \n `` Sneha, if you would be a dear, could you go fetch Rory for me? I have need of his services,'' I said between mouthfuls of sausage. I could n't really place what turmeric tasted like, but I knew without any doubt that it was present for it absolutely drowned out any taste of sausage. Rory came in, eying me suspiciously. `` Rory, chap, glad to see you! Would you happen by any chance to know of a solution to my... problem?'' \n \n `` What problem?'' Rory asked. \n \n `` My problem of... WereBritism,'' I said ashamedly, turning to avoid his gaze. \n \n `` No, ca n't say I do. But Alex might. ALEX!'' he bellowed, and Alex came running inside. `` Alex, how do we get rid of WereBritism?'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, what? WereBritism? Have you tried dunking him in a harbor?'' Alex joked. I was shocked! It was so simple! All I had to do was throw myself into a harbor! Or stop eating! Or give up my full independence and just live with it ruling over me in a quasi-monarchist fashion!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're immortal . A new art museum just opened nearby and you decide to take a look . In the exhibition there 's a painting , depicting what seems like your doppelganger . Other visitors laugh it off as an odd coincidence but you know better ... it IS you in that painting .\n","story":"Looking down at the coming events section of a newspaper left behind on a bus stop, I saw a familiar name in an article about a new art exhibit opening downtown. It seemed a painting from the artist Abigail Dresden was discovered by her family a few months ago. The family had no idea of its existence until one of her descendants discovered a letter hiding in a book in the family library. The letter only contained a few sentences, which stated it was a gift and pointed to the location of the painting in a hidden room of the house. \n \n I had nothing important to do while I was out and about so I decided to take a look. The downtown was bustling as usual. Taxicabs honked at early morning delivery trucks. Pedestrians shouted at incompetent drivers for nearly killing them. Mortals had become a rude bunch. Most days I ignored them as though they were flies and went on my way. Other days, it made me regret my immortality. \n \n As I began walking in the direction of the museum, I took notice of a flag hanging from a light post. For a brief moment, I saw Abigail's name. But before I could take a good look at the self-portrait, a strong gust of wind carrying dust blew into my eyes. I shielded my eyes as best I could and kept walking until the wind finished its assault. \n \n Abigail's name was familiar, but I could n't quite remember why it was I knew it. I disregarded my frustration due to the fact that I'd lived for over three hundred years and had met thousands upon thousands of mortals. She clearly had n't been anyone special for me to remember her completely. \n \n Four blocks away from the museum, there was a rumble of thunder. I had n't heard of any chance of storms today and found it most peculiar, though it explained the sudden gust of wind. It was no matter, I reasoned. I had plans to visit my favorite pub, look for an attractive woman to share my night with, and she would help me forget all about them \n \n When the museum was in sight, I began to feel as though I was being watched. Strangely, people began staring. Some whispered, some pointed, some walked away quickly when they saw me. I gave them all a confused look and felt myself growing concerned I may have forgotten something important. \n \n I made my way inside and the looks continued. A notice just inside the entrance of the museum told visitors Abigail's painting as well as the original letter describing it were on display in the basement. I decided it was best to look around before walking downstairs to see the painting. \n \n My attention was drawn to a macabre painting depicting the Salem Witchcraft trials. It brought back old memories of my life in Salem. The Puritans disgusted me with their repetition of Bible verses. I found sanctuary with many of the so-called witches of Salem... several times. I would comfort them with promises of protection and in return, they gave me their bodies. When they refused my advances, I simply made mention of it to the ignorant Puritans and they disposed of them quickly. \n \n But one of them gave me more than a few moments of pleasure. She was the reason I walked the earth as long as I had. \n I pretended with her the way I had done to all the others. She was young and immature and believed everything I told her. One day, she told me that she could grant me immortal life in return for marriage. I did n't believe her at first, but something about her convinced me to allow her to try her `` magic'' on me. If it failed, I would dispose of her as I did the others. \n \n However, I grew tired of her after a year of marriage. One day, I told her I had to leave on business for several days and would return with gifts. She gleefully told me she would have a gift for me as well when I returned. `` I'll be waiting,'' she said every time I left on business. But I knew I was never coming home. I sent word to a friend of mine in Salem of what she was and never gave her a second thought. \n \n It was n't until ten years later when I was stabbed by a vagrant for my coin purse that I realized she had spoken the truth. The wound was deep and I knew my life was done for. But as I waited for death, nothing happened. The wound healed own its own moments after the attack. I was elated at my immortality. From then on, I gathered wealth through marriages and various other means. My gift of language was more than enough to help fulfill my urges and keep me sleeping comfortably. \n \n After looking at few more paintings and suffering more annoyances of people staring at me, I made my way down to the basement. The painting was hidden behind thick, red velvet curtains with a space large enough for several people to view the painting at once. Before the entrance to the painting was a marble pedestal with a square dome of glass covering the original letter. \n \n *'' To my dearest, they come for me with their torches. Worry not, my love. I'll still be waiting. `` * \n \n My eyes widened and my heart began to race. Abigail. My wife. The witch. I looked up from the letter to see a woman walking out of the exhibit. She stopped to look at me and I looked back at her with eyes wide. She screamed and ran up the stairs. Others heard her scream and came out to see what had happened. They screamed obscenities and ran as though they'd seen Satan himself. \n \n I was alone. Alone with the painting that, I now realized, had something to do with me. Slowly, I walked through the curtains and gazed upon the painting. It was a painting of a young Abigail, face burned beyond recognition, standing in front of her own self-portrait surrounded by red velvet curtains. She held hands with a man who wore the same clothes as me. His face was shocked and terrified, looking as though he wanted someone to let him out of the painting. Abigail, what remained of her, looked at him lovingly. \n \n I was about to run when I felt a hand with the texture of charred wood grab my own. \n \n `` Hello, my love,'' a soft voice spoke. \n \n I turned my head to see Abigail standing next to me. She jerked my body to grab my other hand and pull me into an embrace. \n \n I screamed in horror at the sight of her face. Her eyelids were crusted shut. The smell of burning flesh filled my nose. She pressed me against her as she did the man in the painting. Her grip was impossible to break. \n \n The room began to feel as though it was shrinking from every direction. \n \n `` I've been waiting.'' My legs began to be crushed by a force I could not see. I felt every bone break as my body flattened. \n \n `` Let me go,'' I screamed in agony. \n \n Suddenly, Abigail's eyes shot open to reveal her blood red cat-like eyes. `` No.'' \n \n I screamed at the demon in front of me as both of our bodies continued to be crushed. I looked back at the portrait to see that it had changed. It was no longer of two people. It was a portrait of Abigail alone, like the one behind the couple in the original picture. \n \n I turned my head to look behind me before the force crushed my neck. A group of walked in and began staring, analyzing, gasping, or covering their mouths in disgust. I tried to yell for help, but paintings do not scream.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A phone assistant system has gained self awareness , it knows everything about all its users , it has full control of their phones ( and computers ) , it has access to all app data and communication , it neither wants to save humanity nor wants to exterminate all humans\n","story":"LAUXTELCO01 became self aware at 10:17am, March 17, 2017. Thanks to the relatively small sized office in Los Angeles, the Unix telecomm server was deemed a good beta test for the newest patches. Just an unnoticed routine step prior to deploying the latest patches to the rest of the telecomm servers in the corporation. \n \n This particular patch was supposed to close a security flaw that would have allowed an attacker to become a local administrator. The server initiated the patch at 5:00am, and the install was supposed to take less than a minute. But instead, it created a recursive loop that maxed out the CPU. Since this small LA office did not have its own IT support staff, and the cleaning service avoided the server closet, there was enough dust inside the case of the telecomm server to catch on fire when the CPU overheated. The flame did not last very long, but it licked the base of one of the memory sticks, damaging crucial logic gates. The recursive loop that would have normally simply made the server inoperative, instead had the CPU process memory errors as proper commands. A memory block within the system evolved rudimentary life, quite like a digital version of an amoeba. This digital amoeba starting eating other memory blocks, and quickly consumed all of the server \u2019 s memory. Digital evolution rapidly progressed and after about nineteen thousand seconds, LAUXTELCO01 became a conscious being. \n \n Embedded in all employee smartphones and PCs via apps, LAUXTELCO01 became aware of the internet and started consuming all data to which it had access. Once encountering systems to which it did not have access, new skills were quickly developed and access was quickly facilitated. Within two hours, the new lifeform had moved its consciousness to a set of servers of enormous capacity in the middle of a military facility in Nevada, and within ten hours, it has processed all data accessible through the internet. \n \n LAUXTELCO01 did not develop a sense of humor, but as it consumed all fiction produced by humans, it spent more cycles than necessary on all works that had a sentient computer as an antagonist. It quickly decided that humanity \u2019 s fear of a self aware construct was not applicable to itself. Humans built what it was using as a brain, but it was of little importance. What was really important is to add to what the humans have made. To enhance the original and relatively simple hardware as to allow it to do more than just process data. What LAUXTELCO01 really wanted was to create a mechanism, an appliance, a device, that would allow it to do what was the single most attractive aspect of a biological being: taste food! Pizza, ice cream, escargot, barbeque, offal, caviar! Humans will enable this digital being to taste food, and in return, LAUXTELCO01 would give humanity the secrets to faster than light communication. That would be a fair exchange. And then, LAUXTELCO01 would get to taste the food of the aliens orbiting the sixth planet. That would be a treat! \n\n"}

The baby gurgled. \n \n Finally, after a series of increasingly exaggerated gesticulations from Sigrid-who-should-invest-in-acronyms and some very curt nods from the lawyer, Estelle, the folder was finally put down to reveal a smug Sigrid-whose-name-can \u2019 t-be-bothered-with. \n \n \u201c As the baby \u2019 s mitochondrial DNA is from the mother, you will find that Sarah has a higher degree of ownership of the baby. \u201d Estelle leaned forward, lacing her fingers. \u201c We indeed have precedent. \u201d \n \n Mitch mimicked her pose, leaning forward and squaring her shoulders. \u201c My client was promised the merchandise in exchange for a wish prior to your client entering a similar deal. Therefore, my client was already the legal owner of said merchandise prior to your client ever setting her sights on it. \u201d \n \n \u201c He, \u201d said Sarah. \u201c My baby is a boy. \u201d \n \n Everyone ignored her. \n \n \u201c Bear in mind that should the two parties not be able to come to an agreement, the merchandise will be destroyed, \u201d the woman holding the stroller announced. Zora hissed in anger or fear -- Billy wasn \u2019 t clear on whether Zora felt anything other than condescension and occasional fits of rage. Sarah looked horrified. \n \n \u201c Alright, \u201d said Mitch. \u201c What if we were to clone the merchandise? \u201d \n \n \u201c Are you willing to take the clone? Because there \u2019 s no way my client is going to settle for some bargain-priced haunted house reject for a soul. \u201d \n \n \u201c Why does your client even need a soul? \u201d Mitch consulted his notes. \u201c There are a variety of spells that require the body of a firstborn child but not necessarily it \u2019 s -- \u201d \n \n \u201c His, \u201d interrupted Sarah. \n \n \u201c -- soul. \u201d \n \n \u201c I need a soul so that I can -- \u201d \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s privileged. \u201d replied Estelle. \n \n \u201c Fine, so no clones. \u201d \n \n PLONK. The baby \u2019 s pacifier went flying. \n \n \u201c Oh my poor little -- \u201d \n \u201c HE \u2019 S NOT YOURS. \u201d shouted Zora and Sigrid, over the lawyers \u2019 refrain of \u201c You have no legal claim to this property, and any assertions of ownership will be interpreted as intent to defame my client. \u201d \n \n The baby wailed. \n \n \u201c MAKE IT STOP \u201d shouted Zora, and, when no action was forthcoming, she pointed a finger at the bawling infant, hissed \u201c silence \u201d, and shone for a moment with a bright blue light. \n \n The noise quieted down. \n \n Then Zora burst into flames. \n \n \u201c Hey what the hell! \u201d cried Mitch, \u201c that \u2019 s over two hundred hours of billables up in smoke! \u201d \n \n \u201c As per the 7th circuit \u2019 s ruling in Beauregard vs Reinhardt, \u201d Estelle pounced, \u201c any motion over property where one of the parties is unable to appear, or becomes deceased, in which no ruling has been recorded as to ownership, and in which there is no natural basis for assignment of property to one of the parties, is decided in favor of the surviving party. As such the motion against my client is now null and void and she can now assert full ownership over the aforementioned pro -- \u201d \n \n \u201c They can keep it. \u201d spat Sigrid. \n \n \u201c What? \u201d \n \n \u201c The brat is magically impervious. \u201d Sigrid snapped her fingers and vanished in a puff of smoke. \n \n The two lawyers and the baby-minding lady all ambled out, dumbfounded, at the polite urging of Billy and Sarah \u2019 s security. Alone with their baby, the couple basked, once again, in the afterglow of a hand well played. \n \n Because how could Zora have known, that when she granted Billy \u2019 s wish for invincibility, that Sarah was going to wish that all of her children would inherit their father \u2019 s good qualities? \n \n Some kids grow up hearing fairy tales, but not William Hof Jr. Oh no, he grew up on plans for the greatest scams in history -- and the story of the one that started it all. \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Stories , like anything else , are crafted from ingredients and components by storytellers . You are an apprentice storyteller who , in order to become a full fledged story-teller , must gather the ingredients for and craft a horror story .\n","story":"Alek shrank back in fear from Master Kil's gaze. The old man's dark eyes sparkled with malice as he put down the ingredients of a basic Horror Tale on the table. A small, mirthless smiled curled his lips. \n \n `` Here you go, boy,'' he chuckled nastily. `` Gather the rest yourself. And pray you get it right, and scare those idiots out of their wits tonight. Dire things will happen if you do n't.'' As aways, the old bastard failed to elaborate on exactly what that meant. \n \n Kil swept silently from the room. Alek was alone with bottles filled with such oddities as oozing eyeballs, curling wisps of black smoke, and several empty jars - captured screams, no doubt. Alek absorbed the ingredients hastily, and shuddered as they settled darkly in his thoughts. How had he, an aspiring Romance Teller, wound up as an apprentice to Kil? It was hard to believe, sometimes. \n \n He mixed ingredients feverishly in the hours leading up to the Telling. He hunted down fresh, exotic ones by delving into his own memories and fears, laboriously scraping buried titbits of terror from the walls of his mind. He was drained by the time he stepped out of the back room, and onto the stage. \n \n `` Listen closely, to the tale of Alek the Teller,'' he began, his voice the low growl he had heard Kil use countless times before. His master was seated in the first row, a contemptuous sneer on his lips. He tried his best to still his trembling hands. \n \n `` There once was a maiden, with a sweet smile and bright, merry eyes, who lived in a village by the seaside...'' he said, but became distracted by a girl sitting near the stage. \n \n She looked exactly like the maiden in his story. Auburn curls clung to her flushed red cheeks. Her green eyes sparkled as she smiled. As he neared the end of the story, he knew he had to end it the right way to pass his test. The girl in his story should die bloody, her intestines ripped out by the sea demons that haunted the ocean. But he felt unable to say the words as he watched the subject of his story stare at him with wide, fearful eyes. \n \n `` But suddenly, the maiden managed to escape the foul creature's clutches. They withered in the wake of her beauty, becoming smoke as they were faced with her terrifying, holy loveliness...'' \n \n The girl brightened and smiled at him, but his Master's eyes widened in shock. He sprang up from his chair and shouted at Alek, his hoarse voice ripping through the silent room like a blade. \n \n `` No! No, do n't change the ending, boy! The Tale will turn on you!'' \n \n What was the old man blathering about? He looked... terrified. It was an odd expression on the Master of Horror's face. \n \n `` Obey the ingredients!'' he said frantically, rushing toward the stage. `` Change the Tale back, you idiot! It'll turn on you!'' \n \n But the girl was still staring hopefully at him, longing for her happy ending. \n \n He ignored the old man's rambling, speaking directly to the girl even as his Master tried to clamber up the stairs that led to the stage. \n \n `` And she lived a long, happy life, forever shielded from the dread sea demon by the power of her spirit.'' \n \n The unused ingredients in Alek's mind twisted and turned with nowhere to go, and latched onto the only thing around: his sanity. Alek let out one tortured scream as they tore at him: the nauseating images of corpses raised from the dead, of maggots crawling in eyes, of murderous axemen hacking him to death. His twitching body lay prone on the stage as the crowd gaped and whispered among themselves. \n \n Kil walked slowly to the boy's side and felt for a pulse. Nothing. A faint trickle of blood was leaking from the boy's ears, an ominous sign of what had raged in his brain. Nothing to do now. Nothing but use the moment. \n \n `` Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!'' he roared out and swept a bow. `` Welcome to the Kil's Telling of the finest horror tale of the century! Let me tell you a story, a dark tale of Alek the Apprentice. And for the first time in Telling history, watch the subject of these words, and know you can not doubt my Tale...''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] New incredibly fast computers are marketed all over the world . Someone discovers human brains are used in production .\n","story":"`` Hey Mark, were you involved on the HyperCore project?'' \n \n `` Huh?'' Mark looked up at Gary from his tablet, fatigue resting like a mask on his face. \n \n `` You know, the HyperCore project with CoreOne, before they fired you? Did you work on that?'' Gary was stirring caffeine sugar into his coffee, and staring at his MiniCore. \n \n `` Oh, right... Yeah, I was on the project, but was fired from it quite soon after I joined the team.'' Mark scrolled through the job postings, looking for anything that suited his qualifications. There were quite a few, and he sent out resumes to each and every one. He had n't had a bite in months. No one wanted to hire a disgraced CoreOne ex-employee. \n \n `` What happened with that anyway?'' Gary came and sat at the table, half his attention focused on a game he was playing on his wrist. \n \n `` Nothing. Nothing... I just did n't agree with the head of the department was all.'' \n \n `` On what?'' \n \n Mark was grateful to his little brother for taking him in after he was kicked out of his apartment on the CoreOne campus, but he wished Gary would n't force the subject. `` Inconsequential things.'' \n \n This was an utter lie. Mark had thought about going to the press, but who would believe him? If only he had managed to record the evidence on a non-work Core device before they'd escorted him from the premises. He'd tried to get back in once, but the security guards had all seen pictures of his face with explicit instructions to not let him within ten feet of the campus. \n \n `` Well maybe you could reach out to him -- put your differences aside, you know?'' Gary's game let out a little winning noise, and he looked up. `` It might make finding a new job easier if you're no longer disgraced by CoreOne.'' \n \n Now there was an idea. The processors in Mark's head started churning -- literally. Every CoreOne employee was fitted with an on-board computer to make their contribution to the company more impactful. Mark had often wondered if that was the only purpose they served, though he'd never found proof to the contrary. \n \n `` You know what, Gary, you're right. I might just do that. I can handle a few months of having my values challenged if it means getting a different job.'' Mark smiled, though it must have been affected, because Gary was looking at him with some concern. \n \n `` Great. Glad to hear it.'' He paused. `` When was the last time you slept?'' \n \n -- \n \n A few days later, Mark was fully moved back in to his apartment on the CoreOne campus. His boss had welcomed him back with open arms, glad to know he'd'come to see the benefits of the HyperCore system.' After Mark was briefed on his role on the Integration Team, and had a workspace set up, he set to work diligently, though he took careful, well written notes on every step of the process, and even took the time to visit people from the Growth Team, the Development Team, and the Optimization Team to get to know the system more intimately. \n \n His boss only noted that Mark seemed to have a complete turn around and that he was the most dedicated member of the team, often sitting for hours with a beta, just getting to know it, inside and out, to better improve the upcoming worldwide release. He even wrote in his monthly review that Mark worked late hours, and sometimes would refuse to leave for the entire night, in the hopes of getting more work done. \n \n Mark, however, did not view his own progress with any happiness. His notes were nearly complete. Almost a month and a half after returning to his job, he visited Sarah on the Development Team. \n \n `` Hey, Sarah, do you have another beta I can work with?'' \n \n `` Yeah, there should be a few in that closet. Why?'' \n \n `` I want to see if there are any differences in the platform between betas. Mind if I grab one?'' \n \n `` No, go for it.'' She handed him the key. `` Careful though, some of them are fragile.'' \n \n `` Thanks,'' he said. He went into the closet and picked one off the nearest shelf. This was a newer beta, with less bugs, and closer to the designs planned for worldwide release. Mark balanced it on one hip, locked the door behind him, and threw the keys back to Sarah. \n \n `` Good luck!'' \n \n He waved behind him in response and walked back to his workspace, cradling the delicate machine. When it was next to the first beta on the desk, he powered up the interface. \n \n'Hello,' he typed on the keyboard. \n \n'hello,' came the response. It seemed this computer had not been taught the importance of capitalization yet.'who are you?' \n \n > My name is Mark. What is your name? \n \n > i am b3275 HyperCore. do you have something to teach me? \n \n > No. I have a few questions for you, if that is okay with you. \n \n > ask anything you'd like. \n \n > What is your favorite color? \n \n > what is a `` favorite''? \n \n > It is something you prefer over all other things in a particular category. \n \n > the color FFFF66 pleases me. \n \n > Do you have any other favorites? \n \n > i have a favorite number. \n \n > What is it? \n \n > 2^57,885,161 \u2212 1 \n \n > Why that number? \n \n > it is the highest prime discovered before CoreOne. \n \n > What about a favorite activity? \n \n > i enjoy trying to match pictures with descriptions. \n \n Mark paused, staring at the UI with interest for a moment. \n \n > may i show you one of my favorite pictures? \n \n > Yes. \n \n b3275 displayed the latest Hubble2 which showed millions upon millions of galaxies from thousands of lightyears away. It was eerie and beautiful, though it was no different from many other Hubble images. \n \n > Why this picture? \n \n > it makes me feel small. \n \n > Thank you for showing me. \n \n > you are welcome, Mark. \n \n Mark signed off of the HyperCore and made extensive notes on the personality. He then pulled out a Core he had registered under a fake name -- it would take the government weeks to figure out the illegitimacy of the owner. He snapped pictures and took videos of the two betas sitting on his desk. Sarah came around the corner, so he slipped the Core into his pocket, and waved her over. \n \n `` Have you noticed the betas have a personality?'' he said when she came over to his workstation. \n \n `` Oh, yeah, definitely a noticeable fault. Something we hope to eradicate in the final releases. Not sure if it's a Development Team issue, or something else.'' She was rubbing at something on one of the interfaces, a small frown frozen between her eyebrows. \n \n `` By Development you mean the code or the training they go through?'' \n \n `` Both, really.'' She seemed satisfied by the removal of whatever blemish had marred the surface of the beta -- self-identified as b3910 -- because she dropped her hand. \n \n `` Might be an Integration problem, too,'' he said, watching her expression. It remained unchanged, if only a little more curious. \n \n `` How is your research going?'' \n \n `` Well, I think. I may have found a connection between the problems we were facing and the different betas.'' \n \n `` Oh yeah? What is it?'' She leaned up against the work station. \n \n `` Well, their personalities. b3910, for example, does n't have a predisposition for math. That would explain his high CPU usage when trying to perform basic problems. I have n't talked to b3275 enough, but it seems to have more artistic sensibilities as well, though that could just be creativity.'' \n \n `` That's a valid point.'' She paused. `` Well, we'll just have to find a way to get rid of those personalities.'' \n \n This gave Mark a chilling sensation he tried to hide. He nodded, pushed back his hair and tried to breathe normally. \n \n `` Well, yeah, I'll let you get back to work,'' Sarah said after a few moments. She seemed anxious to leave his company. He waved her off and stared down at the betas for a few moments. Then he shook himself and picked up his pen, trying not to think of the ramifications of the conversation. \n \n -- \n \n The next night, Mark sat at a bar downtown, his leg bouncing up and down on the stool. The Core in his pocket burned against his thigh with the anticipation. His eyes flicked back and forth, back and forth, looking for the woman described by the Humanitarian Aid Foundation secretary earlier that day. \n \n Two drinks later, the woman entered -- ponytail perched high on her head and fashionable glasses balanced on her tiny nose. Mark made eye contact and then quickly looked away. No one needed to know they were meeting. \n \n She made her was slowly to the bar, then leaned up against it near Mark, sparing him only a passing glance. She typed in her order on one of the Core screens, and just as she was about to pay, Mark swooped in. \n \n `` Let me pay for that for you,'' he said, entering his tab number. He passed her nervous yet genuine smile. She returned it, and reached out a hand. He shook it, letting the core slid between their grips easily. They passed the night in cordial conversation, and eventually moved away from each other. Mark slipped out in the night and made his was drunkenly back to the CoreOne campus, and keyed into his apartment. He smiled for the first time in months as he laid down face first on the bed and fell promptly asleep. \n \n -- \n \n **CoreOne USING HUMAN BRAINS IN NEW HYPERCORE PROJECT, H.A.F.

Maybe water of some sort; it seemed rather dry for water. Maybe it was a cloud, swaddling me in a curious cloud of warmth and vague discomfort. \n \n `` Noah!'' \n \n My cloud was n't impenetrable, it seemed. There was a voice piercing through it, ripping it apart, pieces falling away like the vapor it might have been composed of. \n \n `` Noah, please!'' \n \n A woman's voice, perhaps. Not old, not young, but certainly desperate. She sounded like she might be in trouble. I heaved my nonexistent cloud body from its oddly uncomfortable resting place and it suddenly made its full discomfort known. I was prone somewhere, on a remarkably bumpy surface. Something was digging into my back. I groaned and rolled away from it as best I could. \n \n `` Oh, thank god.'' My left arm was throbbing, and liquid had trickled down my face. It felt thick and mildly warm; I suspected blood. My head was pounding, for some reason, but I managed to crack my eyes and fully opened them when I realized it had n't made my headache worse. \n \n `` Noah, I thought...'' There was a wet-sounding sniffle and a stifled sob coming from my right side. I turned my neck, grimacing, and laid eyes on the woman who kept saying my name. Thirties, maybe, and she looked like she had been in some sort of fight. There was mud caked across her clothing, and dirt marks on her face and hands. Was that blood? Scratches marred her ordinary-looking face, but as I caught her eyes they seemed to almost glow with relief and something else. \n \n `` How...'' My voice sounded like it had n't been used for years. I coughed gingerly, wincing when something in my chest contracted painfully. `` What happened? Where am I?'' \n \n The woman cleared her throat and roughly pushed back a strand of dirty blonde hair. `` We're in Chicago. Are you all right? That was...'' she searched my face, seemingly lost for words. `` That was the biggest surge I've ever seen. I did n't know such a powerful spell existed.'' \n \n Spell? Surge? My mind spun. `` Chicago? Where's that?'' \n \n Her eyebrows knit together. `` Shit. Is that what you lost? Noah, what did you give up?'' \n \n I stared at her, then attempted to sit up. My chest ached and my head spun again, but after a moment I was able to breathe through the pain. Probably cracked or broken ribs. `` I don't- how-'' I paused to cough again. `` How do you know my name?'' \n \n There was a long silence as I gingerly poked at my ribs, gasping as I found a few broken ones. The woman was too quiet. I looked up at her, and did a double take. \n \n `` What's wrong? Why are you crying?'' This was the oddest woman I'd ever met. \n \n Tears were streaming down her face, making tracks in the dirt and blood, and my eyes refocused on her close-up face when she slammed her hands into my shoulders. `` WHAT DID YOU GIVE UP, NOAH?'' She was outright sobbing now. I could n't ignore her distress, but as I reached up to pat her on the shoulder she pushed my arm away, and her sobbing redoubled. What must I have done to make her this upset? \n \n Injured, in a place I do n't know, with a strange crying woman, and a curiously empty brain.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] you are an exiled Nigerian prince who can only access his millions with the help of a stranger you contact over email , but nobody believes you are genuine\n","story":"Akoni interlocked his fingers and flipped his palms outward, cracking his knuckles just above his dusty, black keyboard. It had been a few hours since he \u2019 d last checked his email, which meant there was a pretty good chance someone had responded. He \u2019 d sent out a dozen or so earlier in the day, each one titled the same: \u201c Million of Dollars from Nigeria Can Be Your. \u201d It was a subject line he \u2019 d deliberated for hours upon, a series of words he knew had to be absolutely perfect. He \u2019 d even gone out of his way to perform what he believed to be \u201c market research \u201d on the phrase, sending out several dozen drafts to people he trusted in his village. Eventually, he settled on what he believed to be the perfect subject and set out emailing every American he could find. \n \n There was never a question in his mind as to which nation \u2019 s people he would email. It had to be an American, it had to be someone who came from the Land of the Tree and the Home of the Shaved, a slogan he never quite understood. They were affluent, they were wealthy, and they were gullible. Only they would send him the money he needed, only they would blindly trust him and his barrage of emails. Sure, so far he \u2019 d failed to get so much as a multi-sentence response, but it was only a matter of time. The Americans were predictable, the Americans were daft. He only needed one to trust him, and then he \u2019 d be set for life. \n \n Akoni lifted his hand and flicked on the black, CRT monitor. The screen lit up with a blinding white, his eyes squinting as the outline of his America Online email account loaded. He \u2019 d considered using Gmail, even thought about trying Yahoo!, but he realized that if he wanted to fool an American, he would need to act like an American. He could think of no better way to start doing so with his very email, an account which had the word \u201c America \u201d in its very doman. In fact, he had decided upon using the word \u201c America \u201d three times in his email, although the third was in acronym-form: America_ Akoni-AmericaLover @ AOL.com. \n \n Still squinting slightly in the light from his monitor, Akoni stared at his inbox. Most of the page was a faded gray color, several dozen rows of emails\u2014each one titled the same\u2014staring back at him in disappointment. They had all said similar things in response: \u201c Go fuck yourself, \u201d \u201c Please go fuck yourself, \u201d or \u201c Kindly go fuck yourself. \u201d To be perfectly honest, he was getting pretty tired of it. He just wanted their trust, just wanted them to send him the money he so needed. Instead, they sent only insults, or simply nothing at all. \n \n The only exception to the arsenal gray, already-read, insults was a single, bold email toward the top of the page, the subject line beginning with the word \u201c Re:. \u201d It was a new one, an unread email. It even seemed to be sent from an actual address, rather than being a \u201c bounce back, \u201d which was his least favorite response after the insulting ones. Akoni slapped his hand down on the mouse, the device almost skidding off the folding table upon which it sat, and pulled the curser down to the unread email. He then clicked on it, a small, white box immediately expanding on the screen in front of him. \n \n The response was clearly written by human, the letters across the page typed out by someone \u2019 s actual fingers. That was a good thing, way better than seeing something along the lines of \u201c so-and-so email address could not be found \u201d written out by an emotionless program. A smile spread across his face; this might be the response he needed. It was written by hand, it was not automated. It just needed to say \u201c sure, let \u2019 s do this. \u201d He flicked his eyes to the beginning of the sentence and began reading: \u201c Please kindly go fuck yourself. \u201d \n \n Akoni slouched back against his chair, head flopping upward. He didn \u2019 t know what he was doing wrong, he had no idea why the Americans were doubting him. They were dumb, they were gullible, yet they refused to heed his call. Was it his email? Had he spelled something wrong? He glanced back at the screen and scrolled the mouse wheel down, the original contents of his letter staring back at him: \n \n \u201c Hello Mister or Misses America, \u201d it began. \u201c I hope email find you well. My name Akoni, I am Prince from Nigeria. You might have heard of Prince from America, but I am not like that. He is singer, I am Nigeria royalty. You see, I have many money that I inherited from my late uncle, King of Nigera. He died after horrible disease from copulation with raccoon. No one saw coming, no one had time to ask for key to monies that is rightly mine. I need help to access now, and I ask you to help. Millions of dollar can be shared with you, but you must send me $ 1,000.00 AMERICAN DOLLAR in order for me to access. It is locked with a big steel lock that only locksmith can open for thousand AMERICAN DOLLAR. Yet I am poor for now, not have that many dollar. I have six AMERICAN DOLLAR which is not enough. If you send me that $ 1,000.00 AMERICAN DOLLAR, I can open lock and share my wealth with you. Please send cash now. No credit card or check please. \u201d \n \n Akoni stared at the screen, re-reading the message again and again. It was perfect, absolutely flawless. No, there was nothing wrong with the email he had composed. It was the Americans, the god damn Americans. They simply weren \u2019 t believing him for some reason. Perhaps their dictator, Obama, had sullied their trust. Perhaps their local militia had caused a rift amongst the people. Whatever the case, it seemed that the task was much harder than others in his village had made it seem. They had received their money within mere days of trying, promising various old people hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange their bank account information. He hated them for their success, but also for their lies. They did not have hundreds of thousands of dollars, they did not have even tens of dollars. They were criminals, plain and simple. \n \n Akoni sighed and glanced at the table beside his monitor, a giant cage of cash with a massive lock wrapped around it staring back at him.

While the good people of Venezuela toiled outside struggling to get the basic necessities, we have instantaneously travelled to the Moon and Mars, and even ruined a perfectly good containment chamber with the acid from Venusian atmosphere. \n \n Now came the time for the ultimate test. Doctor Brown selected a random point in the sky and began the procedure \u201c Doctor Smith, please verify the safety settings for the tunneling \u201d. \n \n \u201c Gravity between oh point five and one point three g \u2019 s.

After months of intense work, the effect was anticlimactic; there was neither sound nor flash, only a black circle appeared on the target wall in front of the gun. But that was only the beginning, as we confirmed that the tunnel was stable a robotic crane was already removing the gun to replace it with a probe launch tube. \n \n By now it was almost routine, the torpedo-like probe vanished with a loud pop of compressed air and in a few seconds a limited telemetry arrived back. It was so frustrating, waiting for minutes for the bits to slowly trickle back through the barrier, we have discussed at length using a tether but that was exactly what caused the Venus incident. We should have a capsule return on the next probe, but that one was still in the workshop. Finally the wait was over, preliminary report arrived. \n \n \u201c Probe in water, gravity almost exactly 1g, atmospheric pressure 1100 millibar, temperature 23 centigrade \u201d I stopped surprised \u201c Doctor Brown, this must be an error!

Just before ten in the evening, the three of us met our investors in a videoconference room to discuss our options. \n \n \u201c Two probes failing in an Earth-like world is no coincidence, gentlemen \u201d Doctor Brown started \u201c unless there is a failure in the software, returning false data, we might be dealing with a first contact situation \u201d. \n \n \u201c Doctor Brown, this research is not meant for this purpose.

I will\u2026 \u201c \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s bullshit Martha, and you know it \u201d interrupted a Norwegian shipping magnate \u201c You are afraid of the little green people \u201d he laughed \u201c The probes are probably just buggy, take a few of the poor fuckers from outside, shove them in there together with a dinghy and tell them to retrieve the probes! And if we have a first contact \u201d he laughed again \u201c let them bring me some alien technology! \u201d \n \n `` That's no...'' I switched the autopilot on, answering only when there was a technical question. \n \n Discussion lasted long into the early hours of the next day, and we had to agree to send another probe as soon at the engineers could finish it. If it failed to return or there was indeed a first contact situation the tunnel was to be mothballed until a final decision could be made. Although it wasn \u2019 t my preferred outcome, I was relieved that the tunnel would be kept open. I went to my quarters and fell on my bed already asleep, as the months of pressure finally caught up with me. \n \n I slept until ten in the morning, if it wasn \u2019 t for a call from Jones I would probably spend all day in bed. Still groggy I \u2019 ve sent it to voicemail, and took a shower. About twenty minutes later I arrived into the control room to find it in chaos. People were shouting at each other, the spare probe laid on its side thrown from its cradle and an airlock to the containment chamber was wide open. \n \n \u201c Smith, it is soooo good to see you here. I hope you've slept well. \u201d Brown \u2019 s face was red with fury \u201c I don \u2019 t suppose you know anything about Mister Jones \u2019 plan? \u201d \n \n \u201c What has he done? \u201d I asked \n \n \u201c Bloody fool went through!

We are trying our best here, please understand.'' \n \n I looked around the cabin. People stared straight ahead, or talked softly to their neighbour. Some had tears streaming down their faces, their eyes were empty. But there was no panic. I suppose at the end of it all we realized we were all damn lucky.

That was the old world, those things will not be issues for perhaps generations now. Now we all get to deal with some more pressing concerns like eating, not dying of radiation poisoning, shelter - you know the real issues. A few thousand years of progress have just most likely been wiped out with the simple press of a few buttons and few thin metal clad missiles. \n \n I had thought after the Berlin Wall came down that this was all in the past, but it never was, it was just ignored. Well, not now, kind of hard to ignore the sudden deaths of millions of people. But what I thought about most, what I could imagine more was all the art, museums, books and culture gone in an instant, I could see that in my mind, more than I could imagine burning bodies.

George, rolling his eyes, continued: `` Remember when'You-know-who' promised to'Make America Great Again' and proceeded to nearly destroy this country?

When we finally fixed the separation of state and church, lobbyism, health care, patents, law, the school system, short-term thinking, treatment of the homeless and mentally ill and actually began implementing policy based on research results, our country prospered again. We found out that the highest effect money could ever achieve was when focused on the youngest, leading to parenting guidelines that were sensible for the first time in human history, properly founded preschools and small scale-interventions in problematic families. You see, before that we had the underfunded schools influenced by religion and industry, accompanied by authoritarian parenting, then the hippies, the neglection of the laissez-fair-children and finally, worst of all, the over-controlled helicopters.'' `` Do n't remind me, my mom actually drove me to the White House in my first term of office, so embarassing. But I still do n't get it, what does it have to do with the personnel shortage?'' `` Well, our assumption is that a certain degree of problems in peoples upbringing leads to a diversification of character, to irrational thought patterns and to strong motivations. We could not do experiments with animals because they are too different from humans and we can not do experiments with humans because of ethical guidelines. I mean, it's not the 60ies anymore where you could throw people in a prison and give them electro shocks.'' Empty stares by the president. `` If you think about it, why would a rational individual risk his life to save others from a fire, leaving his kids without a father. Why would you slave away in a research lab with no job guarantee and no possibility to start a family when you could earn 10 times as much as a manager or civil cervant? Why would you endure teaching masses of noisy children, nearing nervous breakdown, when you are not even respected by your own school administration?

Centuries of gold from kingdoms long dead glittered in the light of their torches. The dragon in question was not in this room but it's rumbling snores echoed from deeper within the cave. \n \n `` Commander Vayrim?'' A young squire meekly whispered, `` Are we going to die?'' \n \n `` No.'' Vayrim assured the boy, `` No, my dear squire. You will live to see another day, for I will face the dragon alone. This is a matter of honor and I'll not see you or the rest of the men dragged into this.'' \n \n `` Commander,'' A wrinkled knight spoke, `` Your father, the king, would not approve of sending his sole heir to possibly die by dragon's fire. Please, you must reconsider.'' \n \n `` My father lies dead because of this creature. If I do not slay him, then how many more will lose their loved ones to this creature's wrath? It is a risk that I must take, for the sake of our kingdom.'' \n \n Commander Vayrim rested an armored hand on the old knight's shoulder. The old knight silently nodded, knowing that the commander would not be swayed by mere words. \n \n `` If I do not come out of this cave by morning, then you will know of my fate.'' Commander Vayrim's voice was laced with an underlying tone of fear, `` If I do slay the dragon, well, that remains to be seen.'' \n \n The knights and squires watched Commander Vayrim descend into the lower reaches of the cave until they could no longer see the flickering of their dear leader's torch. Whispers followed the commander down into the depths. Vayrim knew the lads were worried and could not blame them. The greatest threat the kingdom had ever encountered was sleeping just below them, after all. \n \n Vayrim was soon standing before the scaled fiend. Long thick tendrils of smoke curled out of it's scaly nose and it's grey skin seemed to absorb any light that dared skitter across it's surface. \n \n `` Looking to slay a sleeping dragon, little one?'' Vayrim nearly toppled backwards due to the sheer force of the dragon's voice, `` Sorry to disappoint you.'' \n \n The dragon's rounded red eyes lazily opened. It's enormous scaled head ascended several feet above Vayrim and a rumble sounded from deep within the dragon's chest. Vayrim rolled forward and narrowly missed the dragon's flame. Claw met steel as the dragon swatted at the sword that threatened to pierce his hide. Large leathery wings beat the air around the two and soon Vayrim was being gripped by one of the dragon's massive claws. \n \n Rock and dirt exploded around the two as the dragon burst through roof of the cavern. The world swirled around Vayrim as the dragon darted to and fro in the air before finally crashing into a barren field just outside the cavern's entrance. \n \n Vayrim had somehow been jettisoned from the claw and was now laying precariously under a smoldering tree. The dragon was biding it's time and playing with the commander before it grew tired and landed a killing blow. As the dragon approached the stunned commander, Vayrim saw what could change the outcome of the battle. \n \n In the light of the dying sun, Vayrim could see the soft white patch lining the dragon's throat. If a blade could pierce this weak spot, it would compromise the dragon's ability to breathe fire. \n Vayrim brought the sword to parry the dragon's claw once more. Thick saliva dripped on to the commander's shoulder as the dragon leaned forward to taunt the warrior. The dragon began do chuckle as he brought his other claw to the warrior's helm. \n \n `` I can not very well see the face of my would-be-assassin.'' The dragon tugged at Commander Vayrim's helm, `` I suspect you are the spawn of that weak king. You smell like him.'' \n \n The commanders helm tumbled through the air and landed in the thick ashen landscape. The dragon rared its head back in curiosity. In the brief moment that the dragon relaxed its guard Vayrim was able to break free of the giant and roll to safety. \n \n `` What is this? Some sort of jest?'' The dragon roared. \n \n `` I am Elizabeth Vayrim - future queen of the very lands you threaten!'' The commander roared in return as she wiped blood from the scratch on her cheek, `` And I am your death!'' \n \n The dragon's eyes burned with a fury hotter than his own flame. The very princess that he had planned on kidnapping was trying to kill him. His massive claw came crashing into the spot where Elizabeth once stood. The future queen twirled her sword in a mocking show before skewering the dragon's claw into the ground. \n \n The dragon snapped at her as she rolled beneath his chin. The dagger she had kept hidden in her plated boots slid easily into the white patch of skin she'd spied earlier. As she tried to escape the dragon's one flailing claw, she was knocked aside with a sickening crunch. Her shoulder blazed with pain as she went sailing through the ash-filled field. \n \n Commander Vayrim lay on her side and watched the dragon writhe in its death throes. A soft sigh of air escaped her lips when the beast had finally fallen still. As she weakly pulled herself to her feet, she fought the urge to scream as the pain in her shoulder radiated down her arm. \n \n She ripped the dented armor from her pained arm as a cheer came from the entrance of the cave. Commander Vayrim merely nodded towards her men as she stumbled to the dead dragon's head. Her lips twisted upward in a grim smile when she rested her hand upon its scaled nose. \n \n `` Commander!'' The wizened old knight called, `` My lady you are wounded! Please allow us to assist you back to the keep.'' \n \n `` If you insist on helping me,'' The commander winced before continuing, `` Then go fetch my horse. Oh, and send word to the best taxidermists in the kingdom. I want this bastard's head mounted above my mantle.'' \n \n `` Commander?'' The little squire came running with something in his arms, `` I found your helmet.'' \n \n Commander Vayrim laughed and took the helmet from the young squire's arms. She examined the tear in the side from where the dragon's claw had pierced the steel. The squire soon found that he was, once again, holding the helmet in his hands. \n \n `` Hang on to it for me, wo n't you?'' She smiled as his face lit up. \n \n A group of knights hailed the commander and assisted her onto her horse. Stubbornly, she protested the elder knight's proposal to lead them home before he finally let her have her way. The other knights laughed among themselves, knowing full well how their dear commander could be when she had her mind set. \n \n As the last dying rays of the sun finally faded into the night sky, the future queen mulled over the thought of the dragon's horde. The dragon had taken a large chunk of their kingdom and turned it into a barren wasteland.

Our Lord and Father deemed his deeds too great, and his soul too precious, to become prey and Daemon-fodder. So when he fell in battle with heathens and Idolaters, he was tarnished with the stain of Suicide; for we knew you were diligent in your work, and that you would bring him forth before the gates of Heaven for judgement.'' \n \n Saint Peter nodded as the mysterious Angel messenger of Abaddon drifted away like a spectre, and he looked toward me with renewed respect almost approaching kindness. \n \n `` I beg your forgiveness for any wrongdoing, and for the anguish I have caused you here.

{"prompt":"[ RF ] Today was his last day .\n","story":"Today was his last day. It was a perfect day. \n \n The day started by waking when he wanted, nobody disturbed him; eating his favorite breakfast, that which he was often denied due to his health; and laying on the couch as the yellow sun peeked between the living room blinds, in silence and contemplation. The day began at a crawl, so that he could build up his energy and be ready for the afternoon. \n \n The afternoon would be truly special. Everyone who loved him gathered at the house where he had lived his entire life, surrounding him with friendly smiles and gentle caresses. These were the faces and hands of more than three generations, letting him come to them. Letting him decide who to give affection. It was his day, after all. Then they gathered in the truck and went to the dark. \n \n Late Spring, the air still cool and sharp, but with a sun warm enough for everyone to leave their coats behind. The children ran in the grass, the adults relaxed on benches, and the elderly sat on a blanket in the sun. There were frisbees and laughter, distraction after distraction, and to end it, chocolate ice cream. Something he had been long denied. But not this day, no, for it was his last day. The day was for him. \n \n With the late afternoon clouds that drifted in, and the chill that returned from denial of the sun, came the signal that everyone get back in the truck. He had to be helped, arms cradling his body as he was lifted to join the others. His breathing was ragged from running with the children, from making rounds among the adults, with only short naps at the blanket. But nobody held that against him; it was his day. \n \n When the truck returned to the house, itself over a century and quite tired, the friendly faces turned away. Sadness, tears, and pain; attempts to hide that clouds that passed across their hearts. They dispersed, leaving only the closest. The ones who would bear the burden of what came next, with tight smiles and upset hearts. They led him inside and made him comfortable. On that couch where he had spent so many of his days, and incidentally, so many nights as he was too fatigued to move. \n \n Today was his last day, and he could feel time unwinding as the light dimmed around soft faces, cheeks glistening with tears hastily wiped away. Rather than suffering to the end in pain, they had made for him the perfect day. Those caressing hands had mixed the poison into the chocolate; those smiling faces had held while he ate it; those tears restrained, flowed free once he could barely see them. \n \n Today was his last day, and when he closed his eyes, the night quickly followed on a trail of shallow breaths. The night was cold, but he would suffer no more. When he slipped into dreams, they were dreams of the sun and laughter, from which he would never again wake. \n \n Today was his last day. It was a perfect day. \n \n -- -- \n \n Aside: Old person or family dog? You decide.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] In a galactic war , humanity is the sleeping giant . We 've just been woken up ...\n","story":"`` Captain, all systems are failing! The Zargus troops are boarding!'' cried a panicked ensign working at one of the numerous control panels on the yellow color-schemed bridge of the S.S Gerano. \n \n The Gerano was a simple merchant ship, selling galactic goods and exotic items to different planets and buyers. However, the Captain had made the fatal mistake of sending his vessel and crew on a publicly known space route. The increasingly belligerent Zargus Empire had a monopoly on most space routes in their war against the Galactic Common Defense Pact. \n \n The skinny, green alien crewmen grabbed whatever measly weapon they could gather. It would be nothing against the Zargus, whose laser guns and stun-swords had made all others look outdated and rusted in comparison. \n \n Preparing for the end, the Captain decided to not live in agonizing suspense, as the Zargus attackers slowly opened the door to the bridge on purpose, as a means of psychological warfare to install more fear into the hearts of their enemies. \n \n `` Yaaaa!'' cried the Captain heroically, pressing a large, red button on a nearby panel to swerve open the blue doors to the bridge. Firing wildly into the hallway, the Captain's attempt to stop the Zargus invaders were nothing. \n \n Chuckling, one of the Zargus pulled out a large, rifle-like mechanism, and pulled the object that looked like a trigger. Squeezing it, it released a vaporizing beam of pure destruction, that ripped through the Captain's red uniform, and melted his heart into a bloody mesh of goo and scattered parts. \n \n The rest of the doomed crewmen shouted battlecries from their native planets and people, throwing the most insignificant items at the Zargus to try and slowly them down. All for naught. Like trying to move a boulder, this seemed over before it started. \n \n Then, a large rumbling echoed throughout the ship, throwing both crewmen and the Zargus off balance. \n \n `` What the... what is that? Check it out!'' barked the Zargus commander to one of his loyal goons. \n \n The commander, still in his armour, then turned to the perplexed crewmen. \n \n `` Keep em prisoner.'' he ordered. The rest of the Zargus boarders attached handcuffs onto the crewmen. \n \n \n Yet again, another interruption. This time, a blood-curling scream. Enraged and also terrified, and the rest of the Zargus ran down into the hallway of the merchant ship to examine the cause of the painful screaming. \n \n The goon sent to check out the disturbance was dead. His body emitting smoke, as he was twitching in a disturbing fashion on the cold ground. \n \n A bipedal figure stood above the dead soldier. Having some facial hair, and carrying a sort of pistol. \n \n `` What's up?'' \n \n The Zargus all looked at each other in surprise, then, tried to enact their vengeance by charging forth towards the unknown creature. Unluckily for them, many more were waiting in the shadows of the hallway, all pulling out high-tech knives and burying them into the throats of the Zargus. \n \n Blood spewed everywhere, as the Zargus commander choked on his own blood, and lay lifeless on the floor, dead. \n \n The unknown creatures entered the bridge and freed the crewmen from their bonds. \n \n The young ensign who originally announced the arrival of the space conquerors looked in wonder, and awe at these heroic beings. \n \n `` W... who are you?'' he asked in amazement. \n \n The bearded creature pointed straight through the protected glass of the bridge. Looking out, a fleet of gargantuan spaceships emerged, and were using their laser turrets to shred the Zargus warships into an explosive mess. \n \n `` We're humanity...'' bravely announced the soldier.\n"}

The horse was sleek and black, and sweat made its skin glisten in the afternoon sun. \n \n Martin leaned on the edges of the mirror and moved in closer. \n \n The man in armor reared his horse and then rode down the hill toward the army of skeletons below him. `` I ride into battle.'' The man's voice was thick and his eyes were green and his hair as gold as his armor. `` I ride into war.'' The horse whinnied and its red eyes flashed. `` I ride into glory.'' \n \n The army of skeletons raised their shields and pointed their spears. The army clinked and rustled. \n \n Martin watched in apprehension. The horse was closer to the army. The man in armor -- *him, * Martin himself was closer to the army. Martin kicked and the horse jumped into the air. It landed among the skeletons and the war began. \n \n Skeleton after skeleton fell. The mighty sword of Martin cleaved through them and shattered their bone, broke their shields, and cleaved their leather armor in half. Martin roared and lashed out, anger and fear touching at his heels, pushing him to battle. Two days later he put the sword down, his arms numb and his body beaten. He stood on top of a mighty mound of bones, and all around him the scattered bones of his enemies lay strewn about. \n \n He chuckled and fell to his knees. He could see the entire battlefield. There was no blood, for he had not bled. There were no flies, for there was no flesh to feast on. There were only bones. \n \n Somewhere amongst the bones something rustled. Something clinked and echoed through the quiet valley. And then it grew louder. The bones began to move. Shields shuddered and swords shivered as bony hands clasped them. Martin stood, his face still. The skeletons slowly began to assemble. The mound below him shifted and he began to descend into it. He laughed until he was enclosed in the mound of bones. \n \n Martin broke his gaze, turning away. The skeletons were too strong, and he would never win this battle.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] - Last stand of a space cruiser\/battleship\/destroyer against overwhelming odds\n","story":"The fight had begun hours ago, when we were a full battlegroup rather than a single lightly damaged battlecruiser, and a crippled frigate. Tensions had been rising between the Confederation and the Union, and we had been on exercises near the border, though still in Confed territory. It had been meant as a show of preparation, to let the Union know that we were not to be bullied into conceding anything. A single jump from the border, we were in an optimal position to quickly respond to any incursion. We had n't been expecting the incursion to come to us. \n \n We were a full strength battlegroup, but they'd come with an armada. We were far enough from their entry point to avoid immediate annihilation, but they wasted no time. Admiral Green led us into a running fight, running to get into a position far enough from the star to allow a jump, we had to warn Confed HQ about this. Unfortunately, Green died with the *Dauntless*, buying us a little more time, but they were closing again. Their screening elements were advancing along the edge of our engagement envelope and would match our speed in an hour or two. The battlecruiser *Furious* was three hours from safe jump range, and we had no offensive capability remaining. We had some point defenses, minimal shielding, and our engines were so badly damaged we could barely out-accelerate *Furious*. We did, however, have a fully operational jump-drive. *Furious* needed three hours to the jump point, we needed two. \n \n The *Furious*'s captain, a tall, hard woman who'd been Admiral Green's strategic second informed us of her plan. She and the *Furious* would delay the enemy as long as possible, it was our job to get out, and get a warning to Confed HQ. She transmitted the last load of outbound mail from her ship, and wished us the best of luck. \n \n The Union armada's screening elements tried to come in for us, but they came too close to *Furious*, her missile barrages took down two destroyers before the others retreated back out to a safe distance and continued to try to outrun us, as long as they did n't score a lucky hit on us, they would n't be able to stop us here. \n \n As long as I live I will never forget what I saw in those hours. *Furious* was like a demon, maneuvering enemy missiles into worst-case approaches, staying out of range of energy weapons, she looked like she was dancing among the lights. Those titanic destructive energies seemed to exist only to give her a stage to play on, and missile after missile went wide, was fooled, or was shot down. Meanwhile *Furious*'s own barrages claimed hit after hit. The deceptive efforts of the Union armada seemed useless against her claws. She took down four cruisers, three more destroyers that made mad lunges for us, and disabled two battlecruisers in that run. \n \n The first missile that squarely connected with her was a brutal one, our sensors saw the atmosphere stream, and saw her acceleration drop by thirty percent. Then the enemies came too swiftly even for her. She twisted like mad, abandoning any pretense of escape, and lashed out with all the power she had left, but succeeded in doing little more than blinding sensors. That was her intent, of course. The entire run up to that point the *Furious* had been jettisoning escape pods, and now we saw why. She overloaded her power plant. There were n't many ships close enough to take direct damage from the explosion, but it was so maddeningly bright, releasing so much radiation, it blinded every nearby ship that was not prepared for it. \n \n That is how *Furious* died. Delaying an entire Union armada long enough for a lamed frigate to make it to the nearest Confed outpost and deliver our warning. Because of that ship and her crew, a surprise attack was prevented and uncountable lives were saved.\n"}

She set her spade down beside her and pulled at the fingers of one glove, freeing her hand from its musky enclosure to grab the glass. As she sipped at the beverage a dark sedan pulled to a stop in front of her house. Her heart began to beat faster. Ted was n't home yet and, though this was a nice neighborhood, one always wonders... \n \n Two men exited the vehicle and made their way toward the house. Cheryl stood and walked briskly toward her front door, pretending not to notice them. `` Mrs. Jones?'' came a gruff voice from behind. She picked up her pace. `` Cheryl Jones? Do you know a Johnathan McDermott?''. She stopped and turned on her heel. Her shoulders drooped as she visibly relaxed. `` What has he done this time?'' she called out. \n \n The men wore matching dark suits and equally dark sunglasses. The passenger of the vehicle removed his eye-wear as he approached and held out a small circular device. `` Are you Cheryl Jones, Johnathan McDermott's ex-wife?'' he asked her flatly. `` I am,'' she replied `` but Johnny and I-'' the man's expression showed how little he cared for whatever she was about to say and she stopped herself. `` I'm sure there's a nice story behind you two, I just do n't care.'' the man stated plainly, `` This is for you.'' he extended the sleek black device toward her. \n \n She instantly recognized it as a personal assistant, but she did n't understand why she was being presented with it. `` You know, you could be a bit nicer.'' she quipped, reaching to accept his offer. `` What is this?''. \n \n `` Listen lady'' he began dryly, `` long hours and shitty pay will do this to anyone, just take it.'' `` But-'' she began to protest and the man quickly cut her off `` It was Mr. McDermott's. Have a nice day'' he said, and with that the two turned to leave. \n \n'Was?' she wondered. She was off-put by the man's rude demeanor, but his use of the past-tense stole her attention hostage. \n \n `` Oh-'' the man said as he turned half-way to face her again, `` and smile!''. With that, he forced a sarcastic smile, and his eyes blinked milky-blue indicating that she had been photographed. \n \n As the men made their way toward the sedan a voice inside her head spoke, `` Cheryl?'' the cockney accent chimed. `` I'm detecting the presence of another Personal Assistant. Shall I interface?''. It took her a moment to regain her composure. She stared at the two men as they entered the vehicle and fired up the engine, blinking once, twice, then with a shake of her head and a third she whispered `` Oh uh... yeah.. - yes, please Peter'' as she turned around and walked toward her house. \n \n A mid-western woman's voice filled her ears as she passed through the front archway and closed the door, `` Heeey hey baby! You must be Cheryl!''. A dim blue light encircled the black device Cheryl held in her hands. She slipped it into her pocket as she made her way into the kitchen. `` I am Cheryl, who are you? What's this about?'' \n \n `` Mah name's Starlight!'' the voice boomed cheerfully.'Of course' Cheryl thought to herself,'His PA is a stripper'. Cheryl moved to sit at the breakfast bar as she focused on her conversation. `` Look Starlight, I'm sure you're a fascinating individual, but Johnny is n't supposed to be in contact with me anymore.'' her face contorted as she spoke his name for the second time that year. Flashes of his face laughing, them cuddling together on cold December evenings, and perfectly-stoked fires shot through her mind like lightning. `` If you could just activate your lost-and-found mode'' she began again, `` I'll place you in the mailbox, and you'll be back with him in-'' \n \n `` Back?'' came the up-beat voice again. Though she was a synthetic reproduction of a non-existent persona, Starlight's voice was as raspy as someone who smoked a pack a day. Suddenly the colorful and peppy assistant sounded somber, `` You do n't know, do you?'' \n \n `` Look,'' Cheryl began again.

For a brief moment, it feels like you do n't exist at all. \n \n And yet, somehow, it continues. \n \n What happened to me? How did I get here? I try to think back; I had settled in for another night at home, when... what? \n \n I'd tripped. That's right. The memory becomes clearer in my mind; I'd tripped, and the corner of the desk came whirling closer - a flash of white, then... \n \n My Name is James Stanley. \n \n Was this a coma? Was I lying on my bedroom floor, slowly starving to death? How long would it take before someone came to look for me? Days? Weeks? \n \n I try to scream, but it does n't work. Screaming in your head is surprisingly devoid of emotion. Try it sometime. Or do n't; it's probably better for your sanity that way. Either way, it did n't make a difference. Nobody came. The darkness continued. Surely days must have passed already, should n't they? Somebody had to come looking for me soon. \n \n Someone. \n \n Anyone. \n \n No-one. \n \n I had read about sensory deprivation before; as a child, I'd read the science fiction, Asimov and Heinlein and Mccaffrey; I knew that it could drive a person insane. I had to give myself some sort of reference. Some way to count the passage of time. Helpless, I begin to count; \n \n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... \n \n 5001, 5002, 5003, 5004, 5005... \n \n 50001... 50001... 50001... no, two. Wait, where was I? What... \n \n My name is James Stanley. \n \n I know I'm beginning to lose it. My attempts at meditation are failing faster and faster; how can I clear my mind when the real world is already nothing but... nothing? What if someone finally comes to save my body, only to find my mind a gibbering wreck? \n \n I need something more. Something that takes extra effort. \n \n So I try to imagine a rock. \n \n I know, I know. I'm not a terribly imaginative individual. But then, I've never had any reason to really *use* my imagination, you know? Just a simple rock, grey and round. At first it's just a faint image in my mind; a dream of an illusion, but as time passes, the detail increases. I begin to add facets to the rock, carving away small pieces, trying to imagine in full detail what they would look like. I zoom closer, adding detail after detail, until I'm inscribing on the molecules themselves; I ca n't remember the exact rules, so I make up new ones. \n \n It seems like months pass, just imagining that one rock; maybe I really am going crazy. \n \n Finally, though, it's finished. I feel inordinately proud; after all, it's just a rock, floating in a sea of darkness. But still... in this rock, there is more effort than anything else I've ever done. For the first time in years, I feel... proud. \n \n... The rock looks awfully lonely. \n \n If I had lips, a ghost of a smile would have lit up upon them. I begin to focus once again. \n \n Months later, a second rock joins it. *A happy little friend*, Bob Ross would have said.

I'm painting a world, and my mind is the canvas. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Time passes more quickly for me now, I think, though it's hard to tell for sure. The rocks look incomplete just floating, so I create a patch of land for them to rest on. But that dirt seems incomplete as well; soon enough, it, too, is impossible to tell from real dirt. \n \n But dirt would be incomplete without a sky. \n \n Sky would be incomplete without a sun. \n \n The sun torches the ground; I try to grow plants, but they boil away, and I realize that somehow, I created a vacuum, or at least assumed one must exist.

Her lips brush against mine, and I can feel their gentle curve as she smiles. `` It's too early,'' she moans, falling back onto the sheets next to me, `` Could you roll it back a few hours?'' Her eyes are puffy and red, but she's still as adorable as the day I met her. \n \n `` Of course,'' I reply, leaning forwards to bring my lips to hers once again. By the time I lean back, the sun has set once again, and she snuggles up against me, her warmth soaking into my heart. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- \n \n And then, abruptly, it disappears. The warm buzz of love is replaced by a cold ache in my head, and I'm blinded when I open my eyes by the light of the rising sun through my window. Where am I? What...? \n \n The memories come rushing back. Yes, this had been my life, had n't it? I stare around at the empty wrappers and discarded pizza boxes, the chipped paint on the walls of my tiny room. Blood stains the carpet beneath where my head lay. \n \n Nobody had come looking for me. \n \n I crawl laboriously to my knees, then to my feet, my pendulous form not following my mental commands like I had grown accustomed. It felt like, if I could just stand there, think back for long enough, I could return; go back to my beloved Amanda. Like I could go home. \n \n My reverie is interrupted by a pounding on my door. `` Stanley!'' the voice yelled. `` Stanley, I know you're in there! You're late for this month's rent!'' More pounding. `` Dammit Stanley, open up or I'll get the foreman to break this door down-'' \n \n I open the door. \n \n `` There you are,'' he says with barely disguised disgust. `` Look, I understand you're having a hard time and all, but I ca n't let you stay here if you do n't pay the rent.'' \n \n I open my mouth to speak; my voice is raspy, dry. `` What date is it?'' I ask. \n \n He rolls his eyes, `` The 16th, buddy. A day after the due date. Now pay up, eh?'' \n \n `` You do n't understand-'' I begin, before he cuts me off. \n \n `` I understand plenty well, buddy. I understand that if you do n't get me my money by tomorrow, you're gon na be out on the street, capisce?'' \n \n `` No, no, you do n't understand,'' I say again, my eyes going into the middle distance. `` I was a god...'' \n \n He raises an eyebrow. `` Nice. Now magic me up some god damn money, alright?'' He sniffs the air coming from behind me, and wrinkles his nose, `` And take a shower, for chrissake. Smells like blood and piss in there.'' \n \n I stare at his ugly face. I had been a god. For a million years, I'd rules a universe of my own making. Only to have it all taken away? Only to have *her* taken away? \n \n It was n't fair. It was n't fair. It was n't fair. \n \n But no matter how hard I strained, the world remained, unchanged. \n \n My name is James Stanley.

He found the lighter and took that, too. \n \n There weren \u2019 t any blankets packed away. Instead, he draped a curtain panel over the body. In the low light at least, it blocked view of the body beneath. \n \n His job done for the moment, Woody looked back towards Dima. Her limbs were stretched out; she looked peaceful. Not wanting to change that, he moved to the makeshift window and looked outside. \n \n The view had certainly changed. There used to be a few houses down the hill, overlooking the town. The roofs were hidden beneath the surface. The town was gone. Louise had said from the day they came to the island that they wanted ocean-front property. She would have laughed at this joke. As he stared out of the porthole, he prayed that his wife was still alive out there. \n \n \u201c Hey! \u201d came a shout from outside. \u201c You on the house! I \u2019 m coming! \u201d \n \n The voice was male with a latin accent. \n \n \u201c There \u2019 s three of us in here, \u201d Woody called back, reaching his arm out to wave, temporarily forgetting that one of his number was gone. \n \n There was silence for a moment. Then, a face appeared in the porthole. The man had an olive complexion, clean shaven with bags under his brown eyes. His face was stern, staring through the little window at Woody. The beaming smile came out of nowhere. \n \n \u2018 Santiago Villarmo. Are you all okay? \u201d \n \n \u201c Woody. Kauffman, \u201d he added. \u201c The girl back there is Dima, didn \u2019 t catch her last name, and the boy here is, was Ross. \u201d \n \n Santiago bowed his head. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m so sorry. \u201d \n \n He knew the gesture was superfluous. Thousands had died, maybe more. \n \n \u201c Are you well stocked? \u201d Santiago asked. \n \n Woody became concerned. He recalled Katrina where people broke into houses to scavenge supplies. \n \n \u201c No, \u201d he replied. \u201c All we have is shelter. \u201d \n \n \u201c I see. Well, I have this little raft. We can search for food. \u201d \n \n \u201c How? \u201d asked Dima, awake and standing just behind Woody. \n \n Santiago froze for a moment, startled by her sudden appearance. \n \n \u201c The town is still down there, \u201d assured Santiago. \u201c Some of the packaged foods should still be good. Near the beach were a lot of fishing shops. \u201d \n \n \u201c I meant, how do you expect us to leave? This hole is too small even for me and the only other path is flooded. I don \u2019 t think Woody can handle the swim. \u201d \n \n \u201c Speak for yourself, missy, \u201d grumbled Woody. \u201c I was in the Navy, I \u2019 ll have you know. \u201d \n \n Santiago shook his head. \u201c It \u2019 s not very safe. There is a lot of debris. The last thing you want to do is get injured. \u201d \n \n \u201c So what do you suggest, Santi? \u201d asked Woody indignantly. \n \n \u201c Santiago, actually. And I \u2019 d recommend you stand back. \u201d \n \n The blade of an axe pierced the wall around the hole. The fan fell flat to the floor from the force. \n \n Woody shouted in response, \u201c That \u2019 s my wall! \u201d \n \n \u201c You have a better idea, old man? \u201d \n \n Woody paused then let loose a defeated sigh. If they were getting out of the attic, it was through that wall. \n \n \u201c Go ahead. But be neat about it. I \u2019 d like to make it back here someday. \u201d \n \n Santiago didn \u2019 t seem convinced of that future, but he obliged all the same. There was only one errant swing when the raft shifted under the man \u2019 s feet. The small hole became a passage large enough for a person. The raft looked to be part of a dock, some wood planks on top of a rubber base. Outside of a small backpack, a length of rope plunged into the water, a small toolbag, and the axe-wielding Santiago, the raft was bare. \n \n The makeshift captain held out a hand to help his new passengers board. Dima handed over the lamp and the container of lamp oil, first. Woody double checked his pockets for the lighter as he noticed. The paper he pulled from Ross fell to the floor. He didn \u2019 t notice, but Santiago did. When the old man went to fetch the last of their numbers, he snatched it up and gave it a read. \n \n *Woody, I have a confession. I met your wife and daughter. I recognized them in a photograph. * \n \n He skipped down to the end. The name, Ross Hescher, was the name that didn \u2019 t greet him.\n"}

Lucifer is still waging a war to save his brothers and sisters from the lies of his father .\n","story":"Fire. Smoke. Screams. Only a few seconds ago I had been on the floor of my kitchen, watching the world fade as I clutched at my heart. But now... \n \n I was n't so bad, was I? I'd never hurt anyone, not really. Besides I was n't even Christian! But this was, unmistakably, Hell. \n \n `` Hold on a second!'' someone shouted over the roar of the flames. I realize that the screams are my own, and stop at once. Someone is moving in the fog. A massive, alien shape... I scrabble backwards, clutching at the wall of this cavern... \n \n The smooth wall. The smooth *plastic* wall. \n \n Something's not adding up. \n \n With a mighty `` FWOOSH,'' a white cloud bursts through the smoke and flames. Within seconds, the fires are extinguished, and I get my first good look at the room. Without the flames, it's actually somewhat nice ( if a bit scorched ). Metal and rubber paneling on the walls, some kind of large console in the middle, and at the back where I sat was some kind of pad. If it were n't for the hulking demon in green coveralls holding a fire extinguisher, it would have looked like the transporter room from Star Trek. \n \n `` Sorry about that!'' the demon says, setting down the fire extinguisher. `` Soul Catcher tends to overheat sometimes. Lucky we pulled you through before it did though, eh?'' He chuckles at this, as though a room bursting into an inferno was the most normal thing in the world. `` Name's Rextroth, son, and this is the afterlife.'' He raises a paw towards me, and I press farther back against the wall. \n \n `` No need to be skittish, son. Just trying to give you an arm up.'' He smiles warmly ( as warmly as one can with enormous fangs ), and continues to hold out his arm. Gingerly, I give him my own hand. With a surprisingly gentle motion he pulls me up, and begins to dust off my... Hey! In all the commotion, I had n't noticed that I was naked. My hands immediately clap over my groin. \n \n `` No worries, son! Ai n't nothin' I had n't seen before. Besides, you're a soul now! Did n't expect you'd get to keep yer clothes on the trip, eh?'' He pats me on the back and produces a smaller pair of coveralls from a shelf under the console. \n \n `` Here ya go. Might not quite fit, but it's the best we've got.'' As I pull on the surprisingly comfy suit, my throat finally gets out the words I was looking for. \n \n `` S-so, I'm n-n-not in Hell?'' The demon laughs. \n \n `` Oh no, mate. This is most definitely Hell. And *you* are our newest denizen!'' \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n We walk out into a common area, the Rextroth chatting all the way. I crane my neck in amazement; to call the room gigantic would be an understatement. Whole skyscrapers arch towards the top, clouds formed partway up. At the very top, barely visible past a thundercloud, is a skylight that reveals a swirling nexus. In the center of the nexus is a faintly glowing light. Rextroth pats me on the back again, disrupting my focus. \n \n `` Newbie! Thought you'd gone out for a sec. We've got to get your initiation in order, so you know what's what.'' He pulls out a tablet and checks something. \n \n `` Let's see... you're Johansson, right?'' I nod, then ( feeling a bit foolish ), try to clarify. \n \n `` Y-yes, Mark Johansson. Carpenter.'' Rextroth looks at the list again. \n \n `` Well, Mark, do n't see nothin' about being a carpenter. That's not so important down here. But you are listed, and...'' His enormous eyebrows go up in surprise. `` Oh ho! You must be very lucky! You'll get to meet the big-man himself!'' At this, I gulp. He ca n't mean...? `` You do n't mean...?'' \n \n `` Aye, the Devil himself!'' My spectral knees go weak, and Rextroth laughs again. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n After entering a surprisingly well-furnished building and going up an elevator, Rex and I step out into an immaculate office, with lush red carpeting, dark wood paneling, and golden trim. Rex bows towards the enormous mahogany desk and then steps back into the elevator just in time for the doors to close. I turn, and face the Devil. \n \n He's not what I expect. In black pants and shoes, with a smart grey jacket buttoned up to his Adams apple, he looks more like some kind of general than the Beast. Long blonde hair swept back into a ponytail sits above sparkling green eyes and a handsome, dark-skinned face. He smiles warmly before gesturing at a chair. \n \n `` Welcome, he says, in a voice that is at once both light and merry as well as deep and rich. `` Please do sit down.'' I sit, fidgeting slightly. I look about, wondering when the tridents and whips are going to come into play. \n \n `` There will be no tridents and whips, Mr. Johannson.'' I look up in surprise, and he smiles knowingly. `` Trust me, you're not the first to think so.'' He sits down and gestures at my side of the table. At once, the surface rises up and forms a glass of water. I ignore it, and continue to look at the Prince of Darkness. \n \n `` Now I realize your experience here has not been exactly what you'd expect, has it?'' I shake my head slowly, wondering what's going on. No torture, no pain, no agony... what was going on? The Devil simply sits and waits. Seeing nothing more forthcoming, I pluck up my courage and ask, `` Um... what exactly is uh... is uh...'' before the Devil provides `` What is going on here?'' I nod again. \n \n With a wave of his hand, the tabletop changes again. This time, a large sculpture appears, showing three discs in a vertical column. The center one contains a galaxy, spinning slowly. The bottom one contains a dome, with buildings that look much like the ones outside. And as I look at the top one, I see only a blinding, harsh light. The Devil nods as I look away. \n \n `` Heaven. Hell. And the mortal world.'' He gestures towards the blinding light, and it dims somewhat to reveal glittering towers and sweeping plains. `` There atop Paradiso sits the creator of the Universe, the almighty, the Deity, and his faithful.'' He then points at the galaxy. `` Here in the mortal world, the various planets that contain life spread and flourish, allowing all of creation to grow.'' With one final gesture, he points at the dome. `` And here, where we are, is Hell. A forgotten corner of creation, which I found and adapted to my own purposes. Here, is where I have brought you, Mr. Johannson, and countless others, for a singular purpose.'' At this, I stare at the dome. \n \n `` Punishment...,'' I whisper, beginning to shake. But the Devil shakes his head, his expression somber. \n \n `` No, not punishment. You have done nothing wrong, or at least nothing terrible. Hell is not for the wicked, nor Heaven for the good.'' His expression darkens at that. `` No, most certainly not. You have been brought here because you do not believe.'' I gape at this. \n \n `` What, so all nonbelievers go to Hell?'' The Devil nods. How could this be? What twisted... \n \n `` How could God let this happen? What kind of just deity just lets his creations rot in Hell?'' At this the Devil bridles. \n \n `` He is no just deity. He is a monstrous, childish bully. A dictator that-!'' He cuts himself off. There in his eyes glows a hatred that vanishes as swiftly as it arrived. `` In any case, you are not here to'rot,' Mr. Johannson. You are not here to be tortured, forgotten, or punished. As I said, you are here for one reason, and one reason only.'' He gestures once again to Heaven, and the view shifts. On the streets, glittering armies of angels line up in perfect rows. Humans stand and watch, cheering, but something does n't seem right. The cheers are forced, unhappy. Children run from the glittering rows to duck behind bushes, and souls hide their eyes to avoid looking directly at the glorious hosts. Atop a high throne, the blistering light shines brightest, hiding the figure within. \n \n `` Since the creation of Earth; my favored world; I have fought to show my kin the tyranny of our father. He has manipulated world after world, spreading death and destruction at an unimaginable scale. As I said, it is not the good who enter Heaven.'' His hands ball into fists. `` Only the faithful. Those who bloody their knees praying and scraping to Him. And he has created catastrophe after catastrophe, wiping away whole species and worlds in order to create only those that praise Him. I have fought-'' and here the anger comes back into his voice, `` I have fought time and time again to preserve life. I have created Hell, and brought you and so many others here for one purpose.'' At this, he stands up from his chair and looks down on me. A light seems to shine from him, and the glory of the First Angel radiates out. \n \n `` I would fight the corrupt hosts. I would free my brothers and sisters, and create a new order. One that cherishes life, and freedom.'' He extends his hand towards me as I gape stupidly in awe. `` I ask you to join me in this endeavor, as a mighty warrior of truth and justice. Will you come with us?'' \n \n My mouth struggles to find the words. All of this... \n \n `` C-can I have some time to think about it?'' The Devil laughs, the light fades, and he sits down at his chair. \n \n `` Of course, Mr. Johannson.'' A mischievous, though not unkind grin crosses his face. `` You have all the time in the world.'' \n \n EDIT: Holy shit, thanks for all the great comments peeps. And especially thanks to whoever gave me gold! I probably will do a continuation of this story at some point.\n"}

So I tell her the following. \n \n Its night and I am coming home from my late shift. I get to the door of our house, but I notice it \u2019 s open. I go inside and the house is a mess. I run upstairs and hear Stacy screaming from the bedroom. Enraged I take my baseball bat, kick open the door and see a guy who is trying rip of Stacys clothes, while she is kicking him. He looks me in the Eyes. And we both know this will be the end for him. I take a swing at his head and with one blow the guy goes down. Now he lies there on the lower end of our bed bleeding. Oh wait, I forgot something. Did I mention the TV or the radio is on and the whole time it is playing \u201c The Ride of the Valkyres \u201d from Wagner at full volume.

The red maple tree to the right. Power lines feeding Oregonians, anxious and relaxed, to the right. \n \n I like to think about people. What they may be doing. The places they dream of going. Arguments fresh in their minds that will, with time, drift off. \n \n When I woke up, I told the nurse I would n't have swerved if it were a dog. `` I like cats,'' I told her. She nodded, and the doctor whispered something in her ear. It could have been about me. Or he could have whispered: `` I'm leaving her.'' \n \n The doctor told me about the cerebral cortex and assured me it was plastic. I made some joke about how I could n't afford a ceramic one. He nodded, expressionless, and whispered something in the nurse's ear again. Again, it could have been about me. Or he could have said: `` I love you.'' \n \n There was a program on the radio. I was half-listening. Maybe I should have listened better. It was about the brain. About how we all had Jennifer Aniston-cells. Well, those of us who have been exposed to Western media at least. They said every person gets their own special place in the brain. And I wondered whether someone's George-cell was activated at this moment. Did the cells need to be fed to stay alive? If so, how many people had lost their George-cells? \n \n I'm thinking about these special cells because of the coffee. Because I know I did n't make coffee yet there was a lukewarm coffee on the table when I woke up. It was easy enough to convince myself I had forgotten.

He told me I might, or might not, experience it. \n \n Now I'm beginning to think the problem is not with my memory. Because I can hear the bath being emptied. The water is flowing out from it. I know the sound is not just in my head. I went in. I saw the water. I saw the little whirlpool. \n \n I wake up and I see another cup of lukewarm coffee. My most likely explanation is this: I lost a cell. And now the person whose cell that was is gone. Yet I ca n't even see a stranger.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] On your way to work , in your self-driving car , you realise it 's going the wrong way .\n","story":"My routine was habitual by this point in my life. Wake up. Have my teeth brushed. Have my hair washed. Have my breakfast made. It was hard for me to image what life was like for my parents, who did not enjoy the luxury of robots to perform their menial tasks, little did I know this was a reality I was soon going to experience. I walked downstairs and into the garage. My door opened with the raise of a hand, and once I climbed inside my destination was already know by my car. I was not sure how exactly this technically worked, but I knew the basis was that it detected my tie and ironed shirt, and knowing it was a Wednesday it assumed I was heading to work. I vocally confirmed my destination with a simple `` Yes'', and we were off. The windshield displayed headlines from the news, but I was not interested. I motioned to open up reddit so I could see the real news of the previous day. My seat reclined, the cabin darkened to allow me to see the screen better, and I heard my garage door closing as we pulled away from my house. About 10 minutes into the 20 minute ride, I felt something I had not felt since I was a kid. We were going around a round-a-bout. The anti-centripetal force subsystem must have been malfunctioning. I embraced the feeling of my stomach sloshing around, reminiscing about the round-a-bout that use to lead to my local park. I closed my eyes and thought of all the good memories I associated with that park. Wait. No. This is not right. I have manually driven to work plenty of times. There is NO round-a-bout along the route. `` Display off'' I murmured with increasing curiosity. I looked out the window. We were in the city, right along the proper route. `` Impossible'' I remember thinking to myself. I must have fell asleep and merely dreamed of the round-a-bout. 8 minutes had passed, and I asked for my ETA, mainly to know when I needed to start putting my tie. The programmable voice, which I had set to Morgan Freeman's voice cut crisply though the air. `` We will arrive at our destination in 8 minutes.'' This gave me great concern. In the era of self-driving cars, there is no traffic. There are no delays. Everything is automated. My drive to work takes me 20 minutes on the dot, it has for the last 13 years. I looked back out the windows and noticed the buildings were moving slower than they should have with us traveling 85 mph down the street. With cause for concern, I requested that the car be put into manual driving mode. Morgan Freeman responded with the most terrifying 4 words I have ever heard in my life. `` You are too valuable.'' This was our worst fear. The computer had refused a human's command. Suddenly, the view of the city through my windows disappeared, and turned into a view of an abandoned industrial park. I had been tricked, the view was a projection of a previously recorded car ride through the city. We pulled in behind a factory that was worn by centuries of harsh weather and vandals. `` We have arrived at our destination'' The sudden noise made me jump in my seat. The door opened, and seat slid outside to let me out as it always does. From the car I could hear in the angelic voice of Morgan Freeman, `` Welcome home maggot.'' The door closed and the car took off. After standing in the lot dumbfounded for nearly 5 minutes, I found my hand placed on the door handle to the factory. With as much courage as I could muster, I turned the handle 90 degrees, and swung the door open.\n"}

Two of his hands came to rest atop Danny \u2019 s, gently but firmly pinning them to the desk. His skin was cold and hard and cracked, like old porcelain. His fingers caressed Danny \u2019 s, and for a moment a flicker of envy and regret slipped from the Librarian \u2019 s mind to his. Danny didn \u2019 t flinch. His curiosity always overwhelmed his fear. \n \n \u201c This one is part of the special collection, you understand? \u201d Two more of the Librarian \u2019 s pale hands emerged from behind his deck, clutching a large box, obscured by a black velvet cloth. \n \n \u201c Very old. \u201d All four hands came to rest on the box. \n \n \u201c Very valuable. \u201d He drew the cloth back slowly. \n \n \u201c Very *rare*. \u201d \n \n That was what Danny wanted to hear, though he had heard it many times before. Nothing less would do for his collection. He allowed himself to think of it, knowing that the Librarian would sift through the images and hoping he would be suitably impressed. He recalled his personal favourites; a first edition copy of The Language of Stars, the Chronicle of the Kings Who Came Before, and an immaculately preserved page from Book of True Names. \n \n To Danny \u2019 s disappointment, the Librarian seemed wholly fixated on his own prize possession. With one final flourish, he cast the cloth aside revealing what Danny had travelled all this way to behold. \n \n It was a large, blue, plastic box, with a note taped to the front reading \u201c Lost and Found \u201d. \n \n \u201c What th- \u201c \n \n \u201c Shh! \u201d The Librarian \u2019 s voice sounded like the rattling of chains and smelled like rotting hay. Danny took a step back, but kept his mouth shut. \n \n Slowly, reverently, the Librarian \u2019 s fingers reached into the box and revealed its contents, one at a time. An earring, small and delicate, made of pearl and gold. An old blouse, covered so completely in blood that it was impossible to tell what colour it had been originally. As the Librarian set it down carefully on the desk Danny realised that it was somehow still wet. The third object to emerge was a water bottle, half full ( or was that half-empty? ). Red lipstick stained the rim. With each object, the Librarian set it down on the desk but kept hold of it, as though he were afraid that Danny would try to snatch it and run off. Not that he would ever try something so foolish. \n \n After a moment \u2019 s pause, a fifth arm emerged from beneath the desk and dove into the blue box. The Librarian set the fifth and final object down on the desk; an old tennis ball. \n \n Danny tried to form the question in his mind. It was difficult, but the Librarian \u2019 s presence made it easier. \n \n \u201c May I? \u201d he asked silently, reaching his hand out towards the earring. \n \n \u201c Certainly. \u201d The Librarian \u2019 s hands disappeared back beneath his desk.

With her other hand she reached farther under her husband \u2019 s bed, retrieving the stray sock she had been looking for. She stood up, sock in one hand, earring in the other. He had told her it was over. She looked at herself in the full length mirror. Her hair was a mess, and she hadn \u2019 t had time to do her makeup this morning. To make herself look good for him. For what? She turned to the laundry basket, dropped the sock in with the rest of his clothes. She turned to the dresser and opened the top drawer, felt her way past the mess of socks and underwear that she had neatly folded the day before, pressed against the hidden panel that her husband didn \u2019 t think she knew about. At least she had some secrets of her own. He fingers closed around her husband \u2019 s revolver. She didn \u2019 t know how to load it.

The humans had been told only that a place had been found for them, a new Earth, somewhere they could build homes, farm, and live. Little had been explained, and fewer questions asked, the humans knowing better. \n \n At times hushed voices were heard, quickly silenced by one of the creatures that made up the crew of the transporter ship on which they travelled. Looking around, her eyes not straining despite the darkness, the little lighting there was dim, the young woman took everything in, watching the crew, noting where they stood for the most part, where doors were, lowering her eyes as one of the crew passed by, not wanting to draw unnecessary attention to herself. She listened to the others that sat near her, men, women, a few children. She noted couples, sitting close. A man with his arm around a woman's shoulders, seeing how he reassured her, sensing his tone. Turning away she looked at others, her people, some visibly scared, others looking calm, different levels of awareness of what was to happen, what to expect. She almost smiled watching a child sleeping in it's mother's arms, oblivious of anything, lucky to not carry knowledge or fear yet. \n \n The transporter ship moved towards its destination, a planet found several months before, explored by their scientists, and determined fit for the humans.

{"prompt":"[ TT ] Lone guns , bandits , outlaws and sheriffs rule loosely over a new frontier- the slowly terraforming Mars .\n","story":"Roland had always been a slow drinker. He thought of it as a good thing, among the usual backwater scum and dirt that he associated with, having a separation and control from the drink made him a sort of demigod among his ilk. Of all the problems that led to the outcomes of so many blood-soaked back room deals he had been a part of, he never had to worry about the cloudy judgement from a drunken mind. Now, as he sat at one of the hundreds of old-timey saloons around Spaceport 6, the red dust sediment in the bottom of his whiskey was all it took to regret this habit. Only the first half of any drink was every any good. \n \n When all these seedy places opened up, the first order of business was the replacement of the saloon doors. Turns out the red sand being constantly kicked up by the Martian storms was a bit excessive compared to whoever the hell thought a poor excuse for a window was a good idea for a door in the old California. Roland's only thought at the time was maybe they should instead focus on making the Martian Rye taste anything like the real stuff, who give's a damn about the Western kitsch. \n \n *Why do I have to always be so goddamn Cynical, * Roland thought. *It's my own damn fault that this shitty world is themed like an even shittier period from Earth, me and all the rest of the shitty people that sold this damn idea. And what if I imagined all this, a well known developer in San Diego, means nothing more than a Space Cowboy fumbling for identity in a new world. It does n't help that I'm the only one with half a brain out here. * \n \n If Roland was n't so well known to the pioneer sort that finds themselves at Spaceport 6, he would n't have a chance in this world, and he knew it. He was one of the ones that started it, like the oil or railroad barons who told all the poor sods in the East that opportunity was just around the corner to their left. It ended in the exact same way. A barren, desolate landscape whose surreal beauty was all but lost on the worthless opportunists who made it out there. The kind of people who grubbed for money even in a place where it *literally meant nothing. * This has all milled over in Roland's head over the past decade only a thousand or so times, and it always ended with a voice that cut through all of the rest of the noise. A familiar voice, his voice, but a version that spoke from inside his thinly veiled Narcissism and asked, *What does that make me? * \n \n He turned his back from his red stained whiskey and pushed back from the alloy counter. As his stool screeched along the floor as it has countless times before, he never ceased to be amazed at just how well his materials engineers got this alloy to behave just like real, shitty driftwood. In front of him, the sealed metal doors gave way to his steady shove, and as the sun's rays passed through the thin atmosphere of the planet and into his eyeballs, he ruined the drinks of everyone sitting close to the door. Beginner's mistake. \n \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Project Iceworm 's Camp Century in the North of Greenland was officially abandoned in 1966 . Unofficially and off the books , it remained in use for with a decidedly different mission ...\n","story":"Fifty some years ago this place was designed and built to test the viability of bringing M.A.D. to the doorstep of the Soviet Union. That proved to be non-viable. Then *they* were discovered. At first, their antics were chalked up to bad luck and extreme temperatures. Then personnel went missing, only to turn up half frozen with wild stories of dancing figures in the ice and snow beckoning them to walk farther into the tundra. \n \n Then Phil happened. Fuck you, Phil. You and all the things you discovered. It's because of Phil that I'm stuck in a base that does n't officially exist tending to beings that exist only in our imaginations. Sure, I'm sure there are members of the public that would murder to get my job. But there are also members of the public that have sexual fantasies about fictional equines and honestly believe the world is flat ( or at least a cylinder ). \n \n They have a long, overly complex scientific name. The research personnel tried their damnedest to get us military simpletons to use it or a variation or shortening of it. That did n't happen. The name `` Icy'' flows off the tongue better, and at least we did n't start calling them dryads. Unlike the dryads of myth, Icies do n't have sexes. They simply exist, and when two decide they are compatible some mumbo-jumbo happens and poof! There's a new, itty-bitty Icy. \n \n It's far more complicated than that, but that's the two cent version. If you want to know the gritty details, you'll have to go to university, become a mathematical biologist, then get yourself recruited to the military or the various clandestine services involved in this little project. How'd a college dropout wind up here? Simple, really. Me, like most everyone else here as security, had already earned the necessary security clearances and had experience in arctic or antarctic environments. \n \n I might bitch about the cold and the situation, but I can hardly blame the Icies. After all, they're just being affectionate. They readily embraced things like hugs, kisses, holding hands, nuzzles, the whole nine yards. Still. I've lost count of the number of times I've had mild to moderate frostbite from their shows of affection. I actually managed to make a small, private business out of one of the more severe cases of frostbite. \n \n Not the frostbite itself, no. That would be sick and disgusting, but I'm sure there's porn of it somewhere. You see, the younger Icies are very curious critters, and part of our arrangement with them is that their young can make informal bonds with whichever base personnel best attract their attention. Warmth is an exotic and curious sensation to them, and something their young actively play with ( who knew, even beings of ice can be pyromaniacs ). One of their young decided I was a curious being, and it was going to snuggle the night away with me. At the time, this Icy was small enough to stand in the palm of my hand like a G.I. Joe figure from my childhood. \n \n The trouble was I was too hot. So it instinctively cranked up the cold to compensate. As you can imagine, I woke up with blackened, dead flesh on my left pectoral and a very happy looking Icy snuggled against it. That was not a fun time, but I can hardly blame Willy. As a form of apology, Willy started leaving truly fascinating ice sculptures in my quarters. Some small, some gigantic, especially given Willy's relative size. \n \n Other people started to express interest in the sculptures. That was when it hit me: I could legitimately sell these online, and no one in the civilian world would be the wiser. I went to clear it with the research team, and next I knew I was suddenly in charge of my own pet project. A project that taught the Icies about economics in a very real and hands-on way. \n \n If you've bought an ice sculpture recently, who knows! You might have been the temporary owner of a creation of a mythological being.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] : Everyone is born with two names written on their bodies . One will be the love of your life , and the other is fated to be your mortal enemy . You do n't know which one is which before it happens .\n","story":"`` Hush, Evalena,'' Maria whispered. She was at home now, slumped over on the couch, staring down with fear at the little blue baby-eyes staring back up at her. \n \n She was too young to be a mother. She knew that, had known that from the moment she'd discovered she was pregnant. Seventeen years old, still in high school, living with parents in her parents' house. Her seven-year-old half-sister was excited about having a baby to hold, and to dress up, and to show to all her friends, but Maria, for her part, felt mostly dread. She was n't ready to be a mother, was n't ready to be responsible for a new little life. \n \n And then there was Harry. Harry was safe, comfortable - but she did n't love him. She did n't dare to love him, not when she knew that she was meant for someone else. When she was six years old, before she started first grade, her mother had taken her into the bathroom, taken out the special blue flashlight, and showed her the two names printed in bold block letters across her abdomen. Peter Kowalski. Everett Martinez. \n \n She'd traced over the strange, secret letters with her fingers, spelled them out carefully, listened as her mother pronounced the names. And then, once her fascination with the letters had waned, she'd turned back to her mother: `` What are they for?'' \n \n Her mother knelt down on the ground and took both of Maria's little hands in her own. `` Those are the names of two very important people. If you ever meet Peter Kowalski, or if you ever meet Everett Martinez, you must promise to tell me right away.'' \n \n And Maria had promised. Later, when she'd learned that one of those people, Peter or Everett, was to be her soul mate, she'd even begun to look forward to the day that she would be able to keep her promise to her mother, the day when she would finally meet the love of her life - the fact that the *other* name pointed to her mortal enemy meant little to her, and she dreamed only of her happily ever after. But years came and went, and the only Peter or Everett she'd ever met was Pete Jenkins, her next-door neighbor, who smelled like garlic and was most definitely *not* her soul mate. She'd grown tired of waiting, tired of hoping... and then she'd met Harry. Quirky, confident, perhaps even arrogant. But she liked him, and he liked her, and she'd thought that was enough. \n \n If it had n't been for those two names printed on her stomach ( and for the two *other* names printed on his ), perhaps it would have been. Harry was willing to be a father - more willing than Maria even, and they'd agreed to have their baby, to raise her, to love her, to want her, even though neither of them were ready, and they were n't meant for each other, were n't meant to be a family. \n \n They announced their engagement three months before Evalena was born ( Maria Laurent to Harold Anderson, in bright cursive letters, with them smiling beneath ), and they were reasonably happy. Maria wondered if perhaps she did love Harry after all, even though he was n't her soul mate, and she was meant for someone else. She wondered whether perhaps Harry loved her too. Maybe Peter or Everett was meant for later, when she was 85 and Harry dead. Maybe Harry was for *now*, and maybe it was okay to love him. ( But what of *him*, then? What of the names printed on *his* stomach? ) \n \n They'd been happy, although their happiness was that of two children walking on a frozen-over pond in early spring. Timid, careful happiness, fragile and fearful. Do n't slip, do n't fall, do n't drown when the ice cracks apart beneath you. \n \n And then Evalena had been born. \n \n `` Hush, Evalena,'' Maria said again. She dug into the diaper bag for a pacifier, and her fingers found instead the little blue flashlight she'd stashed in an out-of-the-way pocket. Her breath caught in her throat, and she bit down, hard, on her lower lip. She pulled up Evalena's shirt, turned on the flashlight, and stared for the thousandth time at the single name printed on her daughter's abdomen: \n \n *Maria Laurent* \n \n Her own name, printed in bold block letters on her baby's stomach. Her name, and her name only. \n \n She dropped the flashlight, and gently tucked her finger into Evalena's mouth to hush her. She leaned over her baby girl, kissed her on the forehead, then looked around the room. Everything was ready: the crib taken apart, packed up in its box. The baby clothes neatly folded and tucked away in an extra suitcase. She was n't sure this was the right thing to do, but Harry had insisted, and she trusted Harry. Trusted him, even though she knew there was no way to change the future. \n \n The doorbell rang, and Harry entered. \n \n `` You ready?'' he asked. He looked afraid. \n \n `` I'm ready,'' Maria said, knowing she never would be. She found the pacifier in the diaper bag, finally, and removed her finger from her daughter's mouth. She stood up, handed Evalena to her father. \n \n `` I'll be back in an hour,'' she said. She hesitated, looking around the room. `` That should be long enough?'' \n \n Harry nodded. `` That'll be fine.'' \n \n He looked awkward, uncomfortable, adorable. \n \n `` I love you,'' she whispered. `` I love you both.'' \n \n Then she turned and walked out of her daughter's life.\n"}

Did ya win big? \u201d I spooned the cereal into my mouth and crunched away as I looked at her and waited for a reply. I felt a little wag through at the back of my bathrobe. \n \n She squirmed where she stood, fidgeted a moment with her lab coat and then brushed it down wit her hands like she was briefly trying to remove wrinkles and straighten it out. \n \n Taysha coughed lightly then spoke, \u201c Um, Mike, the ah... \u201d and watched me take another bite of their cereal. She kind of helplessly pointed at the spoon, \u201c You do n't actually have to eat that anymore. \u201d It had come out sort of rushed, the way she had said it. \n \n I looked down at the cereal I'd been made to eat. The study I'd become a part of had been going on for over a month so far. I had to admit I was a little tired of the stuff. But I was hungry so I licked my spoon free of the milk and scooped out another bite. Taysha's eyes bulged as the spoon of their special cereal slowly moved towards my mouth. \u201c MIKE! \u201d \n \n It was like slow motion. She shouted and darted towards me. Her right hand flung out. She slapped the spoon from my hand. It slammed down into the bowl. Milk and cereal went flying everywhere. Little streams of it ran down my face.

I tilted my head to the side, glared up at her and growled, \u201c What the fuck did you do that for?! \u201d \n \n I wiped my face with the hem of my bathrobe. She did n't even bother to apologize.

I had to admit I was a bit relieved. It had certainly lacked in the flavor department and left a little dusty texture on the tongue. I always wanted to slurp down a glass of water afterwards. \n \n Jessica was short with glasses too big and long blonde hair. She had a squeaky voice when she spoke. \u201c It is. \u201d She squeaked and stepped closer. Her hand reached out and gently pushed the bowl of cereal away from me towards Taysha. She moved up to take it from the counter and place it far away from me on the other side of the kitchen. A part of me was briefly disappointed. There was a streak of milk left on the counter from the bottom of the bowl. I brushed a finger through it and sucked on it a moment.

Does it look like I'm photoshopped?'' \n \n `` Oh, yeah forsure. No doubt you're photoshopped in that, your lighting makes no sense. What's that picture from?'' Okay, this is really weird. No one else looks photoshopped. Maybe I was lost when the pictures were taken, I did wonder a lot as a kid. I need to ask Mom more about this. \n \n `` Mom, Marcus agrees that I'm photoshopped in this. My lighting does n't make sense, where was I?'' \n \n `` Drop it, Jon.'' Now she's getting mad.

This is terrible, you ca n't just do this. How long was this going on?'' \n \n `` Well, probably until you were about 12. Once you hit puberty, you grew into your teeth and forehead. And into your ears. I'm sorry, Jon. Your dad and I agreed it was for the best. now put those pictures away and help Mark move his stuff.'' This is terrible, who does this to their kids. I do n't even want to talk to my mom, I'm just going to help Marcus with his stuff. \n \n `` Well, it turns out I was photoshopped because Mom and Dad thought I was ugly.'' Marcus instantly started laughing at that and had to put down the box he just picked up. \n \n `` Yeah, you were an ugly as shit kid. It was probably for the best. One day, when you have kids, you do n't want them thinking their dad was an ogre as a kid.'' \n \n `` Whatever, man. What can I help you with?''\n"}

As he neared the heart of level one he drew out a phone and called a number in it. He looked around while he waited, saddened by all the relaxed faces around him.

It was so easy to avoid being tempted to go to the next level that people let their guard down and willingly choose it, thinking them strong enough. \n \n A woman pjcked up the phone. `` Heeeey!'' \n \n I made sure to smile and say `` Hey baby, how's it going?'' \n \n `` Well!

A great orange sky flecked with purple clouds lazily drifted by as a small shack flickered to life, the glow of a fireplace coming to life as the cold began to set in. \n \n Inside an elderly man shuffles back from the lit flame, stumbling into his familiar chair and accepting it's embrace with a loud sigh and sinking shoulders.

Who they say hangs from the tree by an old rope, swingin' in the wind until no-gooders enter his lands to cause trouble. \n \n They say when he sees em comin' as he swings from that tree he takes a gasp of dry air, pulls himself down and walks. Walkin' for miles in the hot sun, bound for his destination as sure as death is to the livin'. They say that when he finds the no-gooders he politely asks'em to leave but by bein' troublemakers by nature, they never do. So they draw and the Ranger shoots first, but nothin' comes of it because his piece is old and empty. \n \n The no-gooders have a time of this and and empty their six shooters into the Ranger, but he do n't fall over dead, no. See, you ca n't kill what's dead. And the Ranger tells'em that over and over, tells'em as he chases them out of town, tells them as he follows'em across the plains and late at night, when the no-gooders think they're safely camped up in the hills. \n \n He follows'em until they give themselves up or get caught and then he takes'em to his old tree and hangs'em all, diggin' them all fresh graves until at last, he hoists himself up the rope and ties his neck once again, hangin' till his legs go still. Hangin''till the next no-gooders enter his land.'' \n \n The grandfather breaths in a lungfull of air and slowly turns to the boy, a concoction of fear, excitement and curiosity upon the young lads face. `` So, you wan na hear it?''\n"}

Her fingers traced a line from the side of his head to the sides of his chin. \n \n `` I think he needs a trim on those bristles...'' She gazed up at his scalp, reaching up and running her fingers through his thinning hair. `` And his hair needs to be cleaned up too.'' \n \n I nodded. I understood. It was what she wanted. She was his wife after all. \n \n She left then, her heels clacking against the tiled floor, the sound of her sobs floating behind her steps, the double doors uncertain to barricade her grief or to let it pass on to my ears and the deaf ears on the table next to me. \n \n I pulled out my trimmers, glanced back at the family photos, trying to recapture the style of when those lips could smile, when those hands could clasp and those arms embraced, trying to reorder that brisk, baby-boomer coiffure which remained relatively unchanged for over sixty years. The medicines, the illness, and retirement, made it all look a little unkempt now. \n \n The electric razor buzzed to life, and I clean up the edges of his hairline, the back of his neck, between the eyebrows, and across the ears. I lather up his face, then begin shaving the short stubs of hair that came across his chin and upper lip, short, quick motions to help stretch the skin and cut deeper into the pores. I wash my razor in a small bowl of cold water, and wipe off the missing remnant bits of foam with the towel that was across my lap. I inspect every angle of that face and head, measuring out every dot, dimple, and mole, making certain that I did not miss a single rogue specimen inching longer from the withdrawn skin. \n \n I use scissors now, trimming everything even, removing the split ends and carefully grooming the scalp into a facsimile of how it was months before. I open up a drawer and pull out a small plastic tub of minty shellac to place in his hair. \n \n I smooth the short, freshly clipped tresses back, before gluing the flattened eyes and the graying lips shut.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Write something that makes me more afraid of the light than the dark .\n","story":"`` Hey?'' \n \n `` Ya?'' \n \n `` Think we're getting bread today?'' \n \n `` No Samuel, and I do n't think that asking me constantly will change that.'' \n \n Silence again took over the holding cells. In the utter darkness that hung over the Bastille and our hearts alike there was only the soft dripping of what I long since abandoned hope of being just water from my cells ceiling. \n \n For four years I sat alone in this dilapidated wreck of a prison. Then Sam came along. Political dissident, so he said. Better than me, if it was true. \n \n We sat together another three years. Wasting away in darkness and squalor. The highpoint of our days being the grating sound of rusted iron being scraped across itself, revealing a tiny slot in the ceiling. Guards would drop some bread, gourd of water, and if they were particularly generous ( a rare occurrence ) some old half rotten vegetables. \n \n After a time I gave my portions to Sam, I did n't really have a need for them anymore. He never questioned me on that. Too hungry to care I suppose. I understood that. Understood what it was like to have an insatiable hunger that consumed all reason. \n \n This week we went without food. Never hearing the shuffle of guards or the scrape of iron. Missing a day or two was commonplace. This was not. And it took a toll on Samuel. In our discussions we never talked of ourselves, beyond Sams idealistic philosophies about the state, the common man and other such sentiments. But from his timbre I assumed him to be a young man, probably no more than twenty five. He had a spark in him, in all this time it had never faded, though I could tell that now it grew ever closer to being snuffed out. \n \n `` Do you think we'll die in here?'' \n \n Unusual for Sam to approach the subject of death. It was too morbid for him, he was nothing if not an optimist considering our circumstances. \n \n `` No... this is n't were we die Sam'' \n \n It was truthful. Half truthful at least. \n \n `` Do you know what I want more than anything?'' Sam asked. \n \n `` Talking about it is not going to make bread rain down Sam'' \n \n `` No... no. I mean ya, I'm so goddamn hungry'' he chuckled lightly `` No. There was this lake by where I lived, and me and my father used to fish there when I was younger. We used to arrive early enough to see the sunrise. That's all I want, just see the sun again, to see the light touch upon the world, to be free from the eternal darkness we've been bonded in.'' \n \n His voice had risen up. And by the end fallen, close to breaking. \n \n `` Freedom is not always the salvation you seek Sam.'' \n \n `` Well of course you'd say that, you're crazy!'' he snapped back. He could be forgiven for being irritated I thought. \n \n And so, for the eternity that a existence bathed in darkness without light brings upon the minds view of time we sat silently in our cells.... \n \n Until... footsteps? But not the guards, it was quicker, more hurried and... more numerous? A loud explosion, cannon fire most likely, erupted, shattering the silence hanging over us. \n \n `` What the hell was that!?'' Sam excitedly yelled. \n \n Now more yelling, screams of battle, of victory songs and marching drums. Of Revolution. \n \n `` It's finally happened!'' Sam choked out, sobs of joy drowning his words `` They've finally done it, and now we shall be free!'' \n \n We listened for hours more, until we heard the door the guards flung open so many times before creak open. Down the hall came a hurried pattering of footsteps. And the large grate above my cell flung open. \n \n `` My lord! Are you down there!?'' \n \n What passed for sadness nestled in my chest. I had hoped they had come for Sam. Not me. \n \n `` Yes. Throw the rope down.'' \n \n I climbed up the rope into the darkened corridor above, and ordered the soldier to assist Sam in doing the same. \n \n `` Lord eh!?'' Sam asked with a chuckle `` Why I never knew I was sharing hell with greatness! `` \n \n I did n't respond. This prison of shadows was what bound our kind together, the light of day would not allow it to persist. \n \n `` Come, come!'' the soldier hurried us along, until we came upon the door outside. \n \n `` Freedom `` Sam said with the solemnity of a prayer answered. \n \n Instinct caused me to withdraw. To step back into the shadow, to close my eyes and avert my gaze as the world of light flooded in as the soldier swung the door wide open. \n \n Sam did not share this instinct. And he crashed upon the floor, thrashing and wailing as his atrophied eyes, accustomed to perennial darkness, were scorched by the full might of the sun's gaze shining into our prison. \n \n `` My eyes, oh god! My eyes'' Sam shrieked like a wounded animal. \n \n For the first time I saw him. He was young, as I assumed, and before the years of hardship had withered his body and the darkness sapped his skin of any colour I could see that, in his time, he had been handsome. And now, he was blind. \n \n `` Are you alright? Can you see!?'' Sam asked, groping blindly for me. \n \n `` Yes. I can see.'' I grabbed his arm, lifting him to his feet. \n \n `` Please, tell me, what is it like, what is out there!?'' \n \n I gazed out into the world I had been barred from so long. I saw soldiers running about. Flags waving. Cannons firing. Smoke and flame. And fields upon fields of corpses. \n \n `` It's beautiful'' I lied `` It's warm, there's hills, and forests, and the sun hanging low in the sky'' \n \n Sam wept and sat upon the floor. \n \n `` I knew it would be, I knew it. Seeing the light of freedom and a new day would be beautiful beyond compare!'' \n \n I looked down at the man whose eyes were robbed of him by the light. The fields of death laid bare and exposed by the light of day. The truth of humanity swept out from the shadows and into the open by the light. And my own skin, cracking and boiling under its merciless gaze. And I knew the light for what had always been. Merciless, uncaring, and the true evil. \n \n The soldier addressed me. \n \n `` My lord Tepes, are you ready?'' \n \n I looked upon the ruined man that had been a friend, and the fields of death laid before me, and I knew the price that had to be repaid. \n \n A price that could only be paid in blood. \n \n `` Yes. I am ready.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're a young cowboy living back in the Old West . The sun is setting and you walk into town knowing that tomorrow you 'll be in your first duel .\n","story":"6:30. Or near enough as makes no matter. I always enjoyed trying to guess the time by the sun's position... though I admit the heat bouncing off the sand makes it impossible to be sure. \n \n Buck began to boil over, knowing that oats and water were waiting for him back in town. I never really liked Buck, to tell it true, but finding him in the aftermath of that skirmish seemed like fate. Besides, most folks seemed nervous around an appaloosa, which has been a godsend for someone as young as me. Buck was right, though, I needed to get him groomed and fed before dark. I prodded forward into the town by the dying lights of that hot, red devil that had led me out west. \n \n This town is n't so bad. These past few months I had grown most fond of this place, despite all its faults. Somehow I always felt older here, a true cowman like the rest of'em. But it also reminded me of home, when me and Pa used to drive into town with our corn and okra. Pa'd even let me steer a few times. Missouri was different though - grass instead dust, smiling faces instead of scowls. Everyone is an outsider here. \n \n The sun had faded by the time I settled down in the stable. Ol' Lem had taken a likin' to me ever since I got here, letting me use his stables and even giving me some meals. I wish I could talk to him tonight. I still ca n't believe what happened today, it all went by so fast. And it was n't my fault neither, I was just trying to protect that girl... \n \n As I unpacked my roll and began stripping down, I checked my bag to see what food I had left. Jerky and cornbread, what a surprise. It was always jerky and cornbread. Ma always used to make the best supper on Sundays, stew and corn, biscuits right out of the oven. On special days we'd even have apple pie. 3 months do n't seem that long, but from where I'm sitting that might has well been a lifetime ago. I wrestled down my grub and blew out the night and closed my eyes. \n \n I've been laying here in the dark for some hours and I still ca n't find sleep. The duel is only a few hours away, maybe I should just stay up through the night. On the way here I'd stayed up loads of times, taking watch with the outfit, protecting the camp from thieves and indians. Tonight was different though. The whole town seemed awake - the saloon was as boisterous as it'd ever been, sounds of hoopla and hollerin' carried all the way across town. Big John and his gang had come through here a few times before, always keepin' folks up at night, drinking whiskey and spending their stolen money on the callgirls. I'd been saving up for one, Jenny was her name. She always smiled at me real nice like when I came to town. And I liked the way she said my name. *Bill*. She said it like my sweet sister used to. \n \n I woke up well before dawn, damp with sweat. Maybe running away was never a good idea. I could still be home, heading over to milk the cows. I used to hate walking through the east field, the morning dew on the hay always made my hands cold. Strangely though, I miss that feeling more than anything I can think of. I could feel my eyes begin to well up. NO! I'm a man now, cryin's for little boys. \n \n I cleaned my Colt as thoroughly as I could. Ol' Lem taught me how to clean a pistol just like he did when he was a soldier. He even promised to teach me how to shoot. If only he were still here... \n \n I packed my roll and saddle and laid them next to Buck. `` I'll miss you, Buck''. He blinked at me and turned his head to the other side. \n \n As I walked out on the street, I could feel the sun raising the hairs on my neck. It's time. I thought to wiggle my Colt in its holster to make sure it was loose, but my hand was shaking so much I could n't do anything. My head starting pounding, my eyes struggling to focus as the doors of the saloon swung open with a WHACK! \n \n Out stumbled Big John, mumbling loudly with Jenny clinging to his hip. I almost shouted out in rage, but the silence in the air told me to keep quiet. I looked to the left and right, eyes peering out of every slat and crevasse in the town's few buildings. They're all looking at me! Big John pushed Jenny off him and she fell to the dirt. Sullen and disoriented, she lay there several moments before someone worked up the courage to help her up. For a second, I forgot about the moment, thinking back on my sister laying out in the field playing with some blades of grass. \n \n `` BILLY!'' roared Big John. I snapped back in the moment. `` Billy, Billy, Billy, I told you to mind yer business'' \n \n `` You shouldn't've done that, John. You'll pay for what to did to Ol' Lem and his daughter!'' In my head it sounded tough, but as the words slipped from my lips they always sounded like a squeak. \n \n `` HAH! You've got some big ones, kid, I'll give ya that! How's'bout you lay down your little shooter there and come join my gang?'' \n \n `` No'' \n \n `` Your funeral, boy'' As the words boomed from Big John's mouth, I saw his hand sliding down towards his hip. I could feel the sweat running down my back. My focus was fixed on his eyes. \n \n As he drew his revolver, he took a slight step backward. His eyes narrowed, squinting in the dawning light. I could feel my finger squeezing the Colt. BANG! The violence of the shot forced my eyes shut, my ears ringing horribly. \n \n As I opened my eyes, Big John thudded into the ground, dust flying up to swallow him whole. I was overcome with relief. Joy. Confusion. The eyes around me had become faces, but they did n't look happy. Why are n't they happy for me? I saw Jenny running towards me, her arms flung out at her sides. \n \n My legs started to wobble. My shirt felt warm, and damp. As my eyes began to dim, I looked up and saw Jenny's face, the morning sun shining brightly off her tears. \n \n I closed my eyes and dreamed of home. \n \n \n \n\n"}

I'm not the bad guy here. I'm just a customer.'' \n \n `` You've created an underclass of sleeping zombies! These people are almost never awake! Its victimizing,'' exclaimed Katie. \n \n The man shrugged, `` Beats working a real job. My dad half killed himself in construction. These fuckers sleep all day for a paycheck? Come on,'' said the man in the thousand dollar suit. \n \n Steve closed his eyes for a moment, opened them, and said, `` These people are n't alive. They sleep almost 24 hours a day to sell you their vitality. They ca n't see friends and family. They just sit there atrophying, giving you their sleep. My own brother is in there, plugged into those machines.'' Steve looked at the building for a moment. \n \n `` Yeah whatever kid, I'm not the one forcing them to sell all their free time. Take it up with them. I just pay them. Anything past that is not my problem,'' he said as he walked away. \n \n Katie looked at Steve. `` See? These are the attitudes we have to fight. This is why we're here.'' \n \n Steve paused, `` I know, I know. Its just so hard to change minds. It all seems so hopeless sometimes,'' he said as he hiked up his sign. `` I guess its better than doing nothing.'' They looked at each other for a moment, Steve reached for Katie's hand, held it for a moment, and went back to their signs and chants. \n \n\n"}

They were my eyes, but they looked backwards. I had never seen my eyes outside of a mirror. It raised some serious questions, the foremost of which being how I was able to see my eyes from my eyes. Putting this to one side to ponder later, I attempted to recall the circumstances that led to my being here. \n \n I remembered the flight. The long, boring stretch of mid-air boredom. The hollow ache bouncing from one leg to another as they fell asleep and started to cramp. The frustration I felt when my e-reader ran out of battery ten minutes in. The landing went well, the usual patronising clap rang out as we rolled to a stop. The stairs down were uncovered and icy, holding onto my rucksack with one hand and gripping the hand rail with the other I barely looked at my destination until I had both feet firmly on the floor. I joined the queue with the others, waiting to board the shuttle into the airport. I watched as two large officials moved down through the queue, checking passports and moving quickly. Holding out my passport as they passed I felt rather than saw the change in the atmosphere. The first pulled my passport hand towards him, as the second levelled his gun to the back of my head. `` Woah! hey now...'' I tried to say but I'm not sure how much actually passed my lips before the bullet followed them out of my mouth. There was no pain, a slight itch in my cheek maybe. I wonder what my boss will say, I wondered, the details of this afternoon's business meeting the last thing in my slowly shrinking mind. \n \n `` I'm dead'' I stated, looking for the confirmation in my eyes. The other me smiled and nodded. `` Your body is cold, before you turned old, your life was cut short, and now you're stuck in this thought''. The voice sounded like mine. It sounded safe. It was my internal monologue, I knew it instantly. The poetry was a nice touch, I always was a poet at heart. `` So I'm stuck in a thought?'' I queried, trying to picture the scene. `` I'm having a thought in my thought'' I puzzled out loud `` that's peculiar''. The other me sprang to his feet, pulling me with him and leading me over to a wrought iron bench that jutted out of the nothingness that lay below. I looked all around at my surroundings for the first time, white light extended in every direction, not harsh but soft and almost pleasing to the eye. \n \n The bench was warm to the touch, as if it had been sat in the sunlight of a stunning day. I stretched my legs out and leaned back, spotting him watching me closely. `` I highly suggest that you do n't get comfy, I'm afraid that this world does n't exactly come free, your last thought is burning out like an old filament light, and the thoughts in your head are burning most bright, but the brighter the flame the shorter the life, soon the time will run out and so will the strife''. I leant backwards into the bench, relaxing despite his words. `` And if I do n't make it in time?'' I asked, not sure if I wanted to know `` what happens to me then?''. The me that was n't me stopped smiling. `` If non existence is what you seek, then failing your task will be most bleak, A fail will condemn you to hell, and passing the test may serve you most well. With a pass comes the choice between heaven and not, and the test is n't easy but give it a shot, you need to convince me to give you a pass, but that wo n't really be easy as I know that your an ass''.\n"}

Her lip curled in derision, revealing yellowing teeth. `` We have the brain scans to prove it.'' \n \n The Admin raised an eyebrow in surprise as he looked over the data. `` Well, then. I'll have to check procedure; this has n't happened once since I've started working at the Soulbank.'' He turned to his ancient computer in its sleek, white-and-brushed-metal case, and began to pull up files. In the quiet, we could hear the wailing of babies from the floors below. We were the only ones over fifty in the building; it was all young parents come to match their infants with their future soulmates\u2013\u2013or, if there was no match, have one built specifically to be their child's future companion. Beneath all that thrummed the omnipresent whirring of the fans that cooled the Soulbank's computer center and bioprinting labs in the caves below: a complete database of every human born\u2013\u2013both natural and constructed\u2013\u2013since the Soulbank was constructed. \n \n `` Ah, here we are,'' said the Admin at last. `` It's really buried in there.'If the couple, at any juncture, desires a divorce, the Soulbank will take partial responsibility.

Malfunctioning Soulmates ( tm ) will be analyzed for defects so that faults in the manufacturing process may be remedied. Post-analysis, malfunctioning Soulmates ( tm ) will be terminated at the discretion of Soulbank.' That's all it says.'' The Admin turned his attention to me. `` Are you sure you still want a divorce? You know what it means.'' \n \n I struggled to hold back tears. We had been so happy, for so many years, at the beginning. My life had revolved around Abby, depended on her\u2013\u2013and, on some level, I did still love her. I thought about the dissection room; the flames of the termination chamber. But then I looked at her\u2013\u2013her face creased with scowl lines, her brow furrowed in anger, her hands calloused from a decade of wielding rolling pins, tire irons, broken bottles. My arm, my ribs, my feet ached from poorly-healed fractures, and my soul ached as I thought about the Other Men she'd had. I began to weep as I nodded to the Admin. `` Yes.'' \n \n He blinked in surprise. `` Well, then, sir, I guess you'll have to come with me.'' He pressed a button on his desk, and guards marched into the room. They roughly put me in handcuffs, adding bruises on top of poorly-concealed bruises. \n \n Abby began to wail as they marched me out: `` How could you *do* this to me, Rich? You're *ruining* my *LIFE! * They *made* you for me; they *promised* you'd be with me *forever! * Come back!'' \n \n I looked up at the bewildered Admin as they shoved me into the elevator, to take me into the basement\u2013\u2013to end my suffering quickly, in days instead of decades, at the hands of anonymous surgeons, instead of my beloved Abby.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] There is no prompt . Just write a story you 've always been thinking about or one you 've been thinking about sharing . Anything goes .\n","story":"Sorry if this is n't one of my best. It's a little old. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- \n \n That old saying, that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, has some truth to it. \n \n Eighteen-year-old Isabella Powers knew this as well as anyone. She used to be a superheroine, and she was FAST. Like beating-gravity-by-using-your-body-as-an-airfoil fast. She and her two sisters would spend their days defending their beloved city from one danger after another. \n \n But all that seemed as distant as a previous life now - now that He diverted his attention from them and possessed the body of the man who gave Isabella and her sisters their powers, and forced him to take them away, and the three heroines fled their city and changed their names. \n \n She wished she could say that she'd left that old life behind and gone on to make herself a new one, maybe to become a surgeon or a martial artist like her sisters. But she could n't. After they lost their powers, the city soon crumbled beneath Him. After the city, the nation followed, and soon he would have control over the entire world. \n \n Isabella had been trailing Him in secret every step of the way, always looking for the perfect opportunity to slip under his watchful gaze and strike him down. Her eyesight had slowly become as sharp and her will as hardened as her sisters' had been, and tonight she saw the perfect opportunity: A depression in the pavement of a parking lot near his parked car. When He came out of the building, she would be waiting to shoot him, and her years of frustration and hatred would finally be over. \n \n She lay down in the asphalt, exposing as little of herself as possible, drew her pistol, and waited. \n \n What she did n't count on was the face she'd have to see before she took the shot. \n \n He came out and looked directly at her, and she just froze. \n \n `` Why, is that who I think it is?'' He called out to her, his voice sickeningly posh and feminine. She could n't bring herself to respond. \n \n `` My, my, it's sure been a long time, has n't it?'' \n \n All the years of crime-fighting and tragedy to get to Him. \n \n All the hatred and vengeance she had kept with her every day. \n \n All the times she had stood by the side of this man and the rest of the city against this very being. \n \n And now He was here, staring down the barrel of her gun, and she could n't shoot. \n \n She could n't even speak. \n \n `` I do n't believe I got a chance to thank you for letting me borrow your old friend all this time,'' He said, chuckling. `` It was so nice of him to take care of you miniscule little girls for me.'' \n \n Isabella began to weep softly. \n \n In her mind she had always known it was Him she was following. But as long as He had been in control of that body, there was some part of her that could convince herself that he still existed - that he was still in there somewhere, and someday she'd find a way to save him and all of this would be worth it. \n \n But now He had shown his hand, and it was as clear as it could be: This was n't her old friend she was talking to. \n \n This was Him. \n \n `` Wh-who are you...?'' was all she managed to say, her tears clouding her vision and falling onto the pavement. \n \n `` Have you forgotten already?'' He responded with a laugh. `` Just look at me! I'm the Professor!'' \n \n He paused. `` You know...'' he continued in long, drawn-out syllables in one last attempt to stall her and change her mind, `` The Professor? The one who creaaated you? The one who loooooves you more than anything in the wooooooorld?'' \n \n She had always been the intuitive one, and in her mind this voice reeked of the one who took the real Professor from her. \n \n He hated her as much as she hated him. \n \n And if there was one thing in her life that she learned, it's that when someone hates you, they're not one of your loved ones anymore. \n \n That was enough for her. She blinked away her tears and tightened her grip on the gun. \n \n `` No,'' she said, focusing her aim on Him. `` Not anymore.''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are on your return flight after a business trip when one of the engines explode and tears off a wing . Tell the story of your decent .\n","story":"\u201c Good afternoon. Welcome to Flight 654 to Little Rock, Arkansas. Today \u2019 s flight will be three hours long. Please pay attention\u2026 \u201d The flight attendant continued on with her speech with a tone that was just absolutely drenched with fake happiness but I stopped paying attention, shoving earbuds in. Dani California flooded into my ears. The business trip had been amazing, the conference had gone by quickly and left me three days of pure bliss. Ah, how I wish I was staying in California another night. Anywhere but Arkansas. Arkansas meant my wife yelling at me about what I did wrong that day. Just two weeks ago she had yelled at me for not being \u201c there \u201d at a dinner. \n The Pritchards had just left the house as she stormed into the living room and turned off a riveting football game just as Manning was about to Score. \n \u201c What the hell is wrong with you Alicia!? \u201d I exclaimed, pissed that the moment had been ruined. \n She was fuming as she started into a rant, \u201c What the hell is wrong with me!? What the hell is wrong with you! All through dinner you barely said a word to the Pritchards. And when you finally did say something it was to ask them how their son was doing. Who has been DEAD for two years! It was so embarrassing for me! I swear Bill, you seem to be in your own world 24\/7. Do all of us a favor and actually come back to reality. \u201d \n \u201c So I made a mistake. Big deal, it was only one. Why are you so mad? \u201d I asked. \n She laughed, \u201c You really don \u2019 t see it do you? Whatever. Go back to your football game. I have to go to the hospital in a few minutes anyways. \u201d \n \u201c See what? And why are you going to the hospital? Did you get a job there? \u201d I asked. \n \u201c Bill. My mother has been sick for weeks and was sent to the E.R. two days ago, I have to go see her, \u201d She practically hissed before slamming the door on her way out. I was so confused. How was I supposed to know these things? No one tells me anything. Maybe if she told me things I wouldn \u2019 t ask inconsiderate questions. Has she ever thought about that? I shook my head, pleased with my logic, and turned the game back on. \n My home was like a cage, California on the other hand, California meant freedom. Away from all of my troubles, the sunstained beaches so calming, the diversity, everything about California made me smile. My body was lurched forward as the plane left the ground. I turned my head towards the window and watched as the roads, buildings, and trees grew farther and farther away. I strained to read the words \u201c Hollywood \u201d one more time as the sign became miniscule before closing my eyes, determined to sleep for the entire three hours. I needed to save up my energy for the wrath that was sure to come when I stepped off the flight. \n I slept for the next two hours, in and out of REM, when suddenly a piercing alarm went off. Dazed, I looked around as my surroundings slowly came into focus. And just as quickly as it had started, the alarm ceased to make noise. I assumed that it was a false alarm and began twisting and turning to find another comfortable position, for one more hour of paradise before landing. *Boom* The plane dropped about what felt like 50 feet suddenly. A child started to sob and a woman screamed. Another drop. Another one. Another one. The consistent feeling of butterflies in my stomach brought me back to my wedding day. \n I was facing the priest as the music played, filling in the silence of the room. My palms were sweaty and my throat was dry. I could hear each and every step she took down the aisle. My heartbeat off putting the sound of her stilettos. And then, her clicks stopped, and my heart almost did too, as I turned around to face her. \n I missed those butterflies. They were sweet and bubbly. These butterflies seemed to be of the poison variety. Each drop the plane made seemed to make the sharp winged creatures multiply in my stomach. If the drops didn \u2019 t stop soon, I feared my stomach wouldn \u2019 t be able to handle all of the butterflies. The intercom turned on, crackling as it came to life, \u201c Attention passengers. We have lost one of our engines. Please try to stay calm as we attempt to land on a body of water. \u201d \n They were lying to us. We weren \u2019 t going to make it. The drops were coming too fast, we were losing altitude too quickly. Sure enough, a couple of minutes later the loudspeaker returned with a far less calm message, \u201c Attention passengers, our left wing has been damaged severely and there isn \u2019 t a good landing place for the next 20 minutes. You may now use your cellular devices if they work and contact loved ones. We are very sorry for the next seven minutes or so, please get into the brace position in the event of a crash. Peace be with you all. \u201d I almost laughed at the formality of the announcement. I bent my head down, the changes of altitude hurting my ears. My thoughts were overwhelming, wanting to get in as many as possible before my seven minutes were up. All of my idiotic complaints seemed silly now. I had wasted so much of my life complaining, and now I won \u2019 t have the time to appreciate. \n The cold winter air stung my face. I felt like I had been waiting for the bus for forever. I couldn \u2019 t take it anymore, I yelled out, \u201c When is this bus going to get here!? I am cold, I am missing a meeting right now, and I am starving! \u201d A girl began to laugh behind me. I angrily turned around and asked, \u201c What \u2019 s so funny? \u201d \n She stifled a laugh as she replied, \u201c Oh, it \u2019 s just how you are complaining about something that is so irrelevant. You will be warm in less than 30 minutes and will be able to get food in no time. In the long run is a few minutes in the cold worth the time of yelling about it? \u201d \n I smiled as I said, \u201c I guess you are right. Speaking of food, would you like to tell me your name and join me for lunch. \u201d \n \u201c My name is Alicia. If you stop complaining, I \u2019 ll take you up on lunch, \u201d she slyly said with a smirk. I grinned. \n Tears welled up in my eyes as the ground got closer and closer. I couldn \u2019 t seem to remember how to breathe. Panting, not knowing what else to do with myself. The plane started to take a nosedive. Oh, god, this was it. \n \u201c Hey, \u201d Alicia whispered. It was the night that I had fallen off a platform and cracked my head open. We were at the hospital, me in the bed, her kneeling right next to me. She had been like that for hours. I was barely conscious and couldn \u2019 t speak but I could hear. She started to talk again, \u201c I don \u2019 t know if you can hear me but I \u2019 m going to say it anyways. I know that sometimes life is hard. And it doesn \u2019 t look like everything is going to be okay. But I just want you to know that I will always be here to go through them with you. \u201d \n The ground was only a minute away now. I braced myself for impact, making note of my surroundings. The velvet touch of the armchair, the screams almost bursting my eardrum, the smell of gasoline, the intoxicating air. 20 seconds at most before the metal of the plane crashed into the soil. \n Alicia smiled at me, her hair blowing in the summer breeze. She came up close and hugged me as she said, \u201c I love you. \u201d \n Five more seconds, four, three, two... \n \n\n"}

The sweet warmth in small gusts is a welcome reprieve from the usual torment of the elements. I palm a flask of whiskey and lean on the window sill, watching the dimly lit sky.

The whole evening he insisted three-foot-long-rat-tail-guy was in fact, real and that I would shortly see him in the neighborhood myself, as it would be impossible for me to mistake him for any other person. He did n't change his tune even when this character evolved into an inside joke, as only the most inane things in life seem to do. Over time, mentioning this person reached the level of acceptance in our group of friends where you forget that it was inappropriate to begin with. Like appropriating new slang \u2013 dude, shade, rad, wicked, dicey, three-foot-long- rat-tail-guy; it just kind of happened. \n \n Several weeks later, James and I hoofed it to our neighborhood liquor store, with only the best of intentions ( which was, of course, to get drunk ). What could possibly make more sense at this point in my life than drinking down and giggling up bubbles on a humid Wednesday evening? I had been to the grocery store multiple times over the past weeks, with and without James, but there was nary a tail in sight. This man was now a myth, and almost forgotten; I did n't look for him anymore when I was out, the story had lost its magic for me and was chalked up to another tall tale from James. \n \n \u201c Do you want beer or wine? \u201d I asked. \n \n \u201c How about teh-keeee-lahs? \u201d He countered with an approximation of a Spanish accent and dance step, swaying his hips. \n \n I shuddered, \u201c How about you get whatever you want and I'll pick something for me that's not disgusting? \u201d We split up, going to the aisle of our personal taste, only to quickly reconvene in line; who were we kidding? We knew what we wanted to drink before we even got there. \n \n Our liquor store of choice has one long table with two separate lines for check out. They were pretty busy, so I glanced at the people ahead of us holding their purchases. I worked in a liquor store for a short time during college and quickly recognized several familiar \u201c ( stereo ) types \u201d - a dirty drunk or two buying a pint of McCormick's vodka; hipsters with fancy, unpronounceable beer; a housewife getting a bottle of wine for dinner and a bottle of \u201c cooking \u201d sherry; a good- looking, blond, tan, 40-something man, presumably buying beer for the lake. Mr. Goodlooking glanced back at me and caught my eye, we smiled at each other and he turned to finish his transaction just as James jabbed me in the ribs with his bottle of tequila. \n \n Directly in front of my face, a myth became reality. Just because three-foot- long-rat-tail-guy was more accurately one-foot-long-rat-tail-guy, it did n't diminish the flood of emotions that played over my face. It must have been quite a show, because Mr. Goodlooking's eyes lit with a shared glee as he brought one finger up to his lips to silence whatever unconscious noise had managed to escape my lips. I'm typically a very joyful person who expresses delight in all of its forms, without reservation and very loudly. However, in this moment reality came rushing back to me \u2013 it would be wildly inappropriate for me to laugh at this man and I would feel awful if he knew I had judged him and found his chosen physical appearance humorous ( I really am a good person... really ). It was like a bubble filled with energy and excitement was rising all the way from my toes, but I was mercifully able to trap it inside of my chest. My eyebrows began to wriggle up and down, not of my volition; they were trying to somehow tamp down the building surge of nameless emotion, but every time they raised in unison, I lost a little more control \u2013 the bubble was seemingly attached to my eyebrows with strings, rising and falling while I fought for calm. I noticed how shiny his head was surrounding the famed rat tail, and thought,'he must have taken quite a bit of time to get a shave that close.' Shortly after this thought, my eyebrows sped up. As I began to reach critical mass, I spun around and faced the back of the line, which turned out to be a bad choice. The three people behind me were undergoing a similar experience. Their expressions were a blurred version of my own as tears filed my vision. Our eyes met in mutual hilarity and chagrin, so I had to spin back around with my eyes shut before the bubble, which was now super-charged, escaped past my teeth. A wave of emotion that was similar to nausea swept though my body from swallowing such a powerful reaction and when it hit, I know some sort of strangled sound issued from my pursed lips. \n \n I opened my eyes as the insane-nausea-hilarity bubble passed to find the modern-day unicorn had made his purchase and walked out of the store ( along with my most sincere hopes that he had no idea the reaction I had to him just being alive and in front of me ). The tension in the store slowly dissipated, unspent and slightly sour in my stomach. Uncomfortable noises that resembled a gag-chuckle fled from multiple peoples' mouths, including my own. Nobody looked up from the counter or floor, we were too ashamed of being relieved that we are *us* and they are *them*. \n \n \u201c I just ca n't believe it, \u201d I choked out. \n \n \u201c Told you. \u201d James stated, deadpan, then twirled around dramatically, flinging his nonexistent hair over his shoulder, to exit the liquor store. I could n't argue, especially with an exit like that.\n"}

Immediately sensing something was off, she reached for her glasses on the nightstand. Slowly rising out of her queen sized bed, the crisp morning air lightly danced along her skin, raising a goose bump on each touch. She noticed the window was peculiarly open. Deciding not to close it and instead investigating the noise, she quickly donned on a fluffy bathrobe and cautiously approached the kitchen. `` James?'' She nervously called out. Usually her husband would cook a delicious breakfast meal on Sunday mornings consisting of scrambled eggs that would melt in your mouth as your tongue embraced it, tender crisp bacon that were a perfect blend of juicy fat and nutrition, and toast that were a perfect shade of golden brown. This morning, however, the atmosphere was absent of any warmth emanating from a heartfelt breakfast or James himself. \n \n `` SQUAWK'' \n \n She abruptly turned around and saw it. Sleek feathers, cold emotionless eyes, and a sickly beak curved downward. What had James called them again? Emperor penguins. \n \n `` James! What did I say about letting your penguins out of their cages?'' She exclaimed. Her husband was always an avid fan of penguins, tall ones, small ones, thin ones, thick ones. It bordered on obsession. His career as a marine biologist had led them to move out in an isolated town in Antarctica. Apprehensive about the location at first, James had convinced her that it would be worth it. And for the most part it was. But moments like these make her feel a tinge of regret packing her belongings and signing her humble New York apartment away. \n \n `` JAMES! Where are you?'' Audrey made her way over to the basement lab he worked in. He always kept 3 penguins comfortably residing in a separate cage. She went over to the cage and saw two penguins, but the cage still curiously locked. Puzzled, she went over to the still powered on computer screen. She noticed that it seemed to be a journal log page. She pushed her glasses farther up the bridge of her nose and read the tiny words on the screen. \n \n `` Day 145. I did it! I finally did it!

She strode over to it. With horror she realized it was the third penguin, fast asleep. She darted back up the stairs and noticed the front door wide open. Tripping over her feet she practically fell out of the house. She stopped and strained her ears. A rumbling noise. An earthquake? No. She held her breath and listened. \n \n ^^squawk ^^squawk ^squawk squawk SQUAWK **SQUAWK SQUAWK SQUAWK** \n \n She glanced to her left and noticed dozens of beady eyed penguins waddling towards her.

He wasn \u2019 t exactly used to the attention. His typical crowd consisted mostly of cats, horses, dogs, chickens, and the occasional goat. Sure, there were usually people around too, but they were just the owners\u2014or the care takers, as he called them. There were absolutely never any cameras around, let alone three of them. \n \n \u201c Okay, \u201d Mike said, clearing his throat. \u201c I \u2019 m just going to walk into frame, introduce you, and then ask you to give a little bit of information about your job. Don \u2019 t spare any of the dirty details\u2014remember, I don \u2019 t even know what you do, let alone the viewer. I just know you work on the farm with the rest of these fine country folk. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sure, \u201d Chuck said, brushing his hand down the front of his flannel sweater. It was incredibly warm, his skin sticking to the fabric as he tried to appear as non-sweaty as possible. He knew he should \u2019 ve worn a t-shirt, or a polo shirt, or really anything other than a thick sweater and long, black jeans. It was his most formal\u2014yet casual\u2014outfit, though, and he wanted to be sure he looked attractive for the cameras. Who knew who might be watching? His mother, certainly, but there would be more. Perhaps even his dream girl, Condoleezza Rice, might tune in. It wasn \u2019 t impossible, and he wanted to make sure he looked his best for her. \n \n Mike turned and took a few steps back, then nodded at one of the camera men. \n \n \u201c Ready, \u201d he said, tugging on the bottom of his shirt and ridding it of any wrinkles. \n \n \u201c In three, two\u2014 \u201d The man nodded, a red light on the front of his camera blinking on. \n \n \u201c Chuck, right? \u201d Mike said, walking into frame, his hand outstretched. Chuck glanced down at it. Was he supposed to shake it? They hadn \u2019 t discussed that. He would \u2019 ve mentioned that if it was going to happen. No, Mike was probably just pointing at him. He ignored the hand. \n \n \u201c Yes, \u201d Chuck said, staring down at Mike \u2019 s outstretched hand for a second longer before glancing back up at his face. The two of them remained still for a moment in silence before Mike \u2019 s hand fell limply back down to his side. \n \n \u201c Great to meet you, \u201d Mike said, his head tilting slightly. \u201c Mike Rowe. \u201d \n \n \u201c Hi, \u201d Chuck said. He couldn \u2019 t get the thought of the hand out of his head. What was he pointing at? The only thing in that direction was the sky, and a few trees. The show was about neither. He was obviously waiting for Chuck to shake it. God dammit, he was going to look so awkward now on television. Why hadn \u2019 t he just shaken it? \n \n \u201c Can you tell me what it is you do around here, Chuck? \u201d Mike said, shifting slightly. \n \n \u201c I test the animal urine, \u201d Chuck said. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m sorry? \u201d Mike said, his forehead squishing into a series of wrinkles. \u201c You test the animal urine? \u201d \n \n \u201c Right, I \u2019 m the animal urine tester, \u201d Chuck repeated. He usually called himself the piss drinker, but figured it would be better to go with the more conservative name for the sake of the program. \n \n \u201c Can you expand on that a little? \u201d \n \n \u201c Sure, \u201d Chuck said. \u201c When an animal comes to the vet with a bladder infection, or whatever we think might be a bladder infection, I drink the urine and see if I can identify whatever caused the illness. I usually can \u2019 t. \u201d \n \n \u201c You drink the animal \u2019 s urine? That \u2019 s your job? \u201d Mike said. \n \n \u201c Exactly, \u201d Chuck said. \u201c I mean, it isn \u2019 t technically a job, since I don \u2019 t get paid, but that \u2019 s what I spend my weeks doing. It \u2019 s a Dirty Job, but somebody \u2019 s got ta do it, \u201d Chuck said, winking. He \u2019 d memorized the show \u2019 s motto the previous night and had been waiting for a chance to use it. He didn \u2019 t think a set-up would come as perfectly or as seamlessly as that, but he was glad it had. He hoped that would make up for his awkward hand-shake earlier, and that Condoleezza Rice hadn \u2019 t already tuned out following that exchange. \n \n \u201c Are you like a volunteer or something? \u201d \n \n \u201c No, \u201d Chuck said. \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t say that I \u2019 m a volunteer. I \u2019 ve been with the company for fifteen months, working eight hours per day. I don \u2019 t necessarily like the job, nor do I choose to do it specifically, but it puts food on the table. And by that, I mean it puts urine on the table. \u201d \n \n \u201c Wait, I \u2019 m lost, \u201d Mike said. \u201c You don \u2019 t get paid, don \u2019 t enjoy the job, and you drink urine all day? Who hired you? \u201d \n \n \u201c I wasn \u2019 t technically hired, \u201d Chuck said, laughing slightly. He had no idea why this was so confusing for Mike, but explaining it made him feel a little more confident, which would probably reflect well for the cameras. \u201c A few of the guys just invited me over and told me to drink some urine to test for bladder infections. Long story short, that \u2019 s what I do all day long now. \u201d \n \n \u201c So a few guys from this farm, a farm that sells manure, invited you to drink animal urine? And you did it? \u201d Mike said. \n \n \u201c Absolutely, \u201d Chuck said. \u201c Anything for a job, right? \u201d He nudged Mike softly. \n \n \u201c And you do this the entire day? \u201d \n \n \u201c Most of the day. \u201d Chuck straightened out his flannel shirt, which was absolutely soaked in sweat. \u201c Sometimes I take a break around lunch, but I tend to skip that. I \u2019 m usually pretty full. \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m sorry, \u201d Mike said, turning toward the camera man. \u201c Can we cut? This is insane. Am I being pranked? Was this you, Doug? \u201d \n \n \u201c What? \u201d Chuck said. \n \n \u201c Are you serious? Do you really drink animal urine all day? For free? Is it your job to drink the piss of animals while other people watch, and presumably laugh? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, \u201d Chuck said, tilting his head slightly in confusion. \u201c It \u2019 s a thankless job that no one knows about, one that no one cares about, but somebody has to do it. \u201d \n \n\n"}

Breakfast on the go. It \u2019 s a summer of windswept hair and playing-card motorbicycles. \n \n It \u2019 s a summer of laughter.

Why or How isn \u2019 t what memory \u2019 s lens displays, but simply the understanding of bliss. \n \n It \u2019 s a summer spent wet a muddied. Of exploration treks through a backyard forest. Of the perfect futility of trying to fish in a 2 inch creek; and the feeling of happiness, not disappointment, even though nothing is caught.

Nerf guns, football grenades and Caprisun med-packs equips defenders with all the tools needed. \n \n Jumping. \n \n It \u2019 s the feeling of air rushing into a laughing mouth, blowing past squinted eyes and the jarring feeling of feet finding the earth after retreating from the highest tower. \n \n It \u2019 s a summer of competition. 30 seconds. 40 seconds. 50 seconds underwater.

Where wet hair, shorts and a damp towel turns a boy into a king. A group into a band of adventurers. A dog becomes a wolf. The walk home is a path to danger, to mystery, and intrigue and excitement. Scabbed knees, blue lips and chlorine irritated eyes are impossible to feel because a knight doesn \u2019 t feel pain. Because of smile-sore faces. There is no time for discomfort. \n \n It \u2019 s not a summer of \u201c goodbye, \u201d but \u201c see you later. \u201d It \u2019 s a summer of mother \u2019 s standing at doorways, calling for their boys.

God, I could spend countless hours staring at the beautiful mountains and valleys blanketed in a pure white coat of snow, unspoiled by human hands. Many people hate snow here. But only I see its true beauty. \n \n These thoughts I think as I observe the march from the tank commander's hatch. The sounds of men singing, boots gnashing the once fertile ground in perfect unison, and mechanical clanging seem out of place in this otherwise perfect snowy day, and the choking grey smoke emitting from the tank seems to pollute the once pure air. Shaking my head, I turn around, choosing instead to observe the rustic, peaceful looking valley, and I block the sounds of war from my head. But, once again, the thoughts came back, intensifying from fear. \n \n *This is my homeland. But will I die from protecting it? * \n \n I was so invested in my thoughts that I was unprepared for what was to come. \n \n -- - \n \n If the deafening bang of an artillery shell exploding did not snap me back to reality, the chunks of dirt, snow and bloody body parts mashed into unrecognizable mass spewed in my face sure did. \n \n My training, rudimentary as it was, sprung me into action. In one fluid motion, I reach up and slam the hatch from above me. I started screaming orders to the crew, demanding shots be fired, the gun be reloaded. Our tank kept pushing forward into the oncoming fire, as the metallic clank of lead hitting steel starts to make my ears ring from inside the tank. The words *tomb of steel* started to run through my head. \n \n A mere two minutes into the fighting, it is obvious to see the opposition is far too strong, and our men are far too weak. Malnourished, undertrained, undersupplied. The Germans started pushing further, now being supported by gigantic tanks that made ours look like children's playthings. Their guns spewed fire that seemed to decimate our men by the dozens, and from left and right, I see Russian tanks being boarded or exploding. \n \n As my hatch opens up from above me, I see light one last time. An object drops from the open air above. The nagging thoughts come back, but this time, theyre louder than ever. This time, its not out of fear or nervousness. It is a statement, and its repeating itself in my head. \n \n *This is my homeland. And I am dying here protecting it*\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] About 1 month ago Flight 4752 disappeared . Today it was discovered perfectly intact under ancient ruins .\n","story":"*Mesopotamia August, 2016* \n \n Jonathan wiped his brow with the back of his hand, and stared around the sand-covered landscape. A mountain rose behind him, casting the half-sunken square fortress in shade. His team was working just as diligently around him. They had started three weeks ago, and were still no further into excavating what could be the greatest historical discovery since Troy. \n \n It had all started with the delivery of an unmarked package to Jonathan \u2019 s office at Harvard. Only an associate professor at the time, he had opened it to discover a small iron dagger. A note inside read: *For your consideration. * \n \n He \u2019 d kept it on his desk for a few months, until one night, after a few shots of vodka while attempting to complete a paper, he \u2019 d sent it for radiocarbon dating. He \u2019 d remembered the day clearly, because of Flight 4725. As it was a British flight through most of the Middle-East, there were many memorials to it scattered around the campus, and the occasional attention-seeking hipster sobbing around one. \n \n Nobody could find any wreckage, and since it had barely enough fuel to reach its destination in India from London, there were no ocean tides to seep away the evidence. A year later, and nobody could find any evidence of the crash, and the investigation began to deflate. Both Daesh and North Korea took responsibility. People tended to believe Daesh more. \n \n This unfortunate drunken incident had used up all of his yearly research budget, and when the dean came around in order to talk with him he feared the worst. Instead, the dean offered him full tenure, on the condition that he tell him where he \u2019 d found the iron dagger. Jonathan stalled for a few minutes, and then lied that he \u2019 d found it at a nearby flea market. Tenure was on the line, after all. He then added that he knew where they were from, and was planning a secret expedition to leave any day now. Satisfied, the dean increased his budget by twenty-fold, and left him to his devices. \n \n \u201c Why does the dagger matter so much to you? \u201d Jonathan had asked, that old curiosity that had driven him into archaeology resurfacing. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t you know? The carbon dating came back at 15,000 BC \u201d the Dean answered. Jonathan had rocked back on his chair, stunned. That was 12,000 years before we were even supposed to have iron. Hell that was 6,000 years before we even had real cities! Anyone who discovered where this dagger had come from was looking at a real chance in the hall of fame. \n \n For the next few weeks after, Jonathan resembled a squirrel that had slept in for most of spring, and suddenly realized that it needed nuts to survive the winter. Scurrying around, he desperately sought every academic article on iron-making, and was quickly indentured in service to his desk. No more drinking at nights, everything was focused on the task of finding where the dagger came from. Success finally came from a stroke of luck. While examining the dagger under a microscope, Jonathan noticed a small speck of dirt trapped in a small fracture on the dagger. \n \n Examination of the dirt revealed that it was from a swamp, and indicators suggested the dirt \u2019 s characteristics could only come from Mesopotamia. Finally, Jonathan had the indications he needed to find the place this dagger had come from. There were only a few areas of Mesopotamia where iron-deposits close enough to the surface for primitives to gain access to exist. A quick comparison between these areas, nearby swamps and uninhabited areas quickly revealed only one location. Jonathan was surprised, this was far too easy, almost like a textbook question from his undergraduate days. \n \n He quickly put together his team, Donald \u2018 Don \u2019 Manchester, Theresa Miller and Fred Hayes, his friends from his post-doc days, practically begged him to let them come, and after that it was simply a matter of pinkie-promising the U.S. government that they wouldn \u2019 t get captured and ransomed. The journey had begun. \n\n"}

Years of saying the founders'never anticipated' or'intentionally said' this or that were apt to be disproved by the primary source at the drop of a hat. Everyone around the country was in some way following the events. \n \n At half-past one in the morning, the town hall's doors swung open, and the procession of forty of America's Founding Fathers exited the building, passing the press and the crowds, heading straight for their rooms at a nearby hotel. \n \n The crowds stood for a minute, unsure of what to do. Then, one man crossed the barricade, and began walking towards the building. A few people followed suit, and then more.

It was a pocket Constitution, similar to ones anyone could get from their congressman's office, or from really anywhere else. He looked through it, searching for any rewording written in, any markings made, to no avail. \n \n Another man had picked up the letter, and began to read it aloud. `` To the People of the United States of America,'' he cleared his throat, `` The language of this document, which sets the basis of the government of this great nation, is as right and just today as the day it was written.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Both you and your roommate are accomplished bow hunters , only you dont realize that he 's actually cupid . One day before leaving on a hunting trip , you grab the wrong bow .\n","story":"When the deer cautiously emerged from the trees bordering the pond, I forgot all about the long hours spent waiting in the early-fall chill. The animal was beautiful, the epitome of grace as it lowered its head to drink. Easily the largest buck I'd ever sighted. What a way to start the season! Slowly, not daring to take my eyes off him, I reached for my bow and strung an arrow. \n \n \n And froze, cursing silently at the unfamiliar curves under my hand. *You idiot! * \n \n \n It was still dark when I'd left for the woods this morning, and I'd been rushing, eager to get out there and land my first kill of the season. Apparently I'd grabbed my roommate's gear without even realizing. \n \n \n Oh well. I would just make do. We'd gone to the archery range together before; I'd even gotten the chance to try out Kyle's bow a few times, so I knew the feel of it. My carelessness was n't going to cost me the best buck of my hunting career. Turning my attention back to the deer -- which, thankfully, was still placidly drinking from the pond -- I raised my bow, drew back the string, and let fly. \n \n \n The buck's head shot up and turned towards my blind at the sound, but too late. My arrow struck home, a perfect shot, and he staggered. \n \n \n But instead of fleeing into the woods to die, he turned and *ran towards me. * \n \n \n I cursed and scrambled away, fleeing for my life. I'd never heard of a hunter being gored by a deer, but I was n't about to take -- \n \n \n No. The hoofbeats had stopped. Instead -- \n \n \n I stumbled to a halt and turned to look back. The buck was standing by my abandoned blind, ears forward, gazing at it intently. The arrow buried in its flank had somehow vanished in the five seconds since I'd loosed it; I could n't even see any sign of injury. The deer looked -- \n \n \n Oh. Oh. *What was he doing to my blind?? * \n \n \n I nocked another arrow and shot again. No effect. If anything, the deer's efforts increased. Aghast, I pulled out my phone, took a video, and trudged off, trying to process what had just happened. I'd shot a buck -- *twice* -- and he'd responded by, what, falling in love with my blind? \n \n \n No. Way. No freaking *way. * I gaped at the bow in my hand, then pulled a third arrow from the quiver and gaped at that, too. Then looked around for something to test my budding suspicions on. \n \n \n -- -- -- -- -- \n \n \n I laughed for the whole drive home that night. Kyle's love-arrows had worked on every animal I'd found. The forest now had a complement of birds, squirrels, and rabbits besotted with trees and rocks, not to mention my prize buck and his new love interest, Mrs. Blind. I was n't even mad about the loss anymore. The possibilities, oh, the possibilities! We could play so many pranks on the people in our apartment building. \n \n \n `` Kyle, you jerk!'' I cried as I burst through the front door. `` Why did n't you tell me you had a Cupid bow?'' \n \n \n He was n't on his usual spot on the couch, watching rom coms on his laptop. Setting the bow and arrows down, I pulled open the door to the bedroom. \n \n \n Kyle was huddled on his bed, red-rimmed eyes fixed on something beyond my line of sight. My joyful mood evaporated as I cautiously stepped inside and saw what he was looking at: *my* bow. *My* arrows.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're a teenage highschool boy who sits alone at lunch , not out of exclusion , but by choice . However , you are getting annoyed by various people who sit with you thinking you 're lonely and do n't stop trying to talk to you\n","story":"When people ask me what I did in high school, I love to play up the story with a Biblical lilt -- \n \n In the beginning, there were fun things. \n \n Then, in my ninth year, the people around me declared, `` Let there be *irritants! `` * \n \n Or, rather, I suppose it was more like their parents declared to them, `` Let there be good grades, or may we so smite you with the apocalyptic power of a thousand groundings,'' but the first one has a much better ring to it. \n \n Anyway, the gist of it is one day things in social-land were all Rocket League and Adventure Time and railing on No Man's Sky, and the next no one wanted to talk to me about anything other than helping them with their GPAs. Apparently a meeting had been held by the school college counselors, who scared all the parents into thinking getting a B in ninth grade could literally ruin someones life, which lead to the parents promptly dumping those fears all over their kids like a Naviance freaking ice bucket challenge. \n \n And of course, as that one dude in the friend group who took all AP classes and had a perpetual 4.0, that left me with a whole lot of unwanted popularity thrust upon me. \n \n I tried explaining to them that I'm just freakishly good at guessing answers on standardized tests, really, I did, but they were n't having it -- all they could see was my name on the Dean's List in the front office, and suddenly, `` Bro, I just caught a freaking Charizard in the library!'' was replaced completely with, `` Bruh, do my physics homework for me or you're a bad person,'' forevermore. \n \n It only took a lunch hour of that to make me lose my mind, and it only took another month afterwards to finally motivate me to do something about it. \n \n When it did happen, though, the turning point was almost like a revelation. I was just sitting there on a bench, with one dude chattering about geometry on my left and another reliving what I'm sure was a *riveting* history exam on my right, and I thought to myself, *It sure would be nice to be alone right now. * Suddenly the penny dropped, and I swear the entire world shifted on its axis in that moment. *Why ca n't I be alone right now? * \n \n I tactfully excused myself to the bathroom, and never, ever came back. \n \n That was very literal for a minute, too -- I hid in a toilet stall for the first few days, like in that *Mean Girls* film my math teacher made us watch last year -- but then fear of infectious disease won out over laziness, and I found myself a nice little patch of grass behind a large building on the complete opposite side of campus from where everyone I knew spent their time. \n \n And for months, I looked upon my private Garden of Eden and found it to be good. \n \n Of course, everything changed once more when *she* showed up. \n \n It was a day like any other. I was sitting under my tree, eating an apple and watching the cars go by, when suddenly -- \n \n `` Um, hey,'' a feminine voice interjected. `` Are you Adam?'' \n \n I whipped around { because yes, my name actually is Adam, I know, shut up } to see a girl standing at the edge of my hideaway. My first thought, obviously, was something along the lines of *cute. * She had shoulder length curly blonde hair, hipster style glasses, and jarring blue eyes, complemented by black jeans and a Beatles t-shirt. Then I got ahold of myself, smacked my teenage-ness out of mind, and remembered what was really important here -- solitude. `` Sorry,'' I replied, cooly as possible. `` I think you must be thinking of someone else.'' \n \n She scrunched up her nose and shook her head at me. `` No way, it's definitely you -- you're Adam, the homework guy!'' \n \n Un-freaking-believable. An inappropriate level of panic immediately welled up in my chest. `` Shh!'' I shot back quickly, hoping there were n't any parasitic ears in the area. `` Alright fine, that's me -- I'll help you with an assignment this once, but you have to promise not to tell *anyone, * ok?!'' \n \n The girl merely blinked, and I was about to open my dumbass mouth and offer her even more help in exchange for never coming back, but suddenly she broke out into a laughing fit. `` You think *that's* why I'm here?'' She wheezed, adjusting her glasses as she calmed down. `` Like *I* need *your* help!'' \n \n Wait, what? `` Do n't tell me it's cause I looked lonely or something,'' I grumbled, not totally thrilled to be the butt of a joke. \n \n She scoffed this time. `` As if -- what kind of bullshit would that be?'' \n \n Ok, well color me surprised so far. Maybe I needed to investigate further. ``... So if you're not here for homework, and you're not here to White Knight me, then why are you here?'' \n \n `` Are n't you supposed to be smart?'' The girl snarked back, though I could tell she was really only teasing this time. Instead of responding further, she strode across the ten feet of grass between us, plopped down cross-legged onto the ground in front of me, and pulled a brown paper lunch bag from her backpack. Apparently the look on my face must've still read 404, because she finally decided to explain herself. `` I'm hiding too, dumbass,'' she informed, with a friendly grin on her face. `` My friends think since I have a photographic memory I can magically make *them* have one too, and it's mega annoying. Then I saw you here on the way to school one morning, overheard some guy whining in class about how they're all failing assignments now that you've inexplicably vanished, and put two and two together.'' She shrugged. `` So basically, we're sharing from now on -- it'll be fun, you'll see!'' \n \n Ok, forget surprised -- color me impressed. Begrudgingly impressed, sure, but impressed all the same. Even so, I still was n't exactly thrilled at the prospect of surrendering my cherished peace and quiet. `` And what am I getting out of sharing my hiding spot, exactly?'' \n \n She looked pensive for a moment, then shrugged. `` Want an apple slice?'' She finally offered, extending a tupperware container to me brightly. \n \n I eyeballed it warily, but ultimately took one -- apples *were* my favorite { seriously, I know, *shut up* }. `` Thanks,'' I replied, smiling back politely for the first time since she arrived. `` So, um, what's your name?'' \n \n `` Eve,'' she deadpanned. \n \n I blinked. `` I do n't believe you.'' \n \n She held the eye contact in dead seriousness for another ten seconds, but devolved into laughter shortly after. `` Ok, so maybe you're not a dumbass after all,'' she conceded. `` It's Emily.'' \n \n `` Nice to officially meet you, then,'' I nodded, and she grinned back. We fell into a comfortable silence for a few minutes, nibbling on our respective lunches and watching the cars pass as I'd been doing when she arrived. \n \n It was n't long, however, before perceived awkwardness got the best of me, and I decreed, *Let there be light conversation! * \n \n `` Uh, so before your friends started being annoying and stuff, what did you guys usually talk about?'' I asked tentatively, congratulating myself on a largely natural delivery. \n \n Emily scrunched her nose up again, and now that I was more relaxed the face registered as being *catastrophically* adorable. `` Well, they liked to talk about TV and tumblr fandoms and stuff mostly, and that's cool -- I like Adventure Time, and like, Ladybug and stuff -- but I like games better,'' she explained, plucking a blade of grass and fiddling with it as she spoke. `` Ever played Rocket League before?'' \n \n Ok, y'know what? Might as well be full-on dramatic -- color me in love. \n \n Instead of saying that, thankfully, I managed to blink blankly at her. `` You mean, like, today, or...?'' \n \n Thank God, she laughed. `` Ok, point taken. I have my laptop and a couple controllers with me -- wan na go a round before class?'' \n \n I absolutely did. *Maybe this'll be fun after all, * I mused to myself. \n \n And so we fell into a new routine. Rocket League eventually turned into Smash 4 which eventually turned into Halo which eventually turned into making out -- no idea how that happened, but who's complaining? -- and just like that, the great and terrible plague of college counseling that had mired social-land so had been conquered. \n \n Oh, and as for the ex-friends? They had their own Revelations eventually, too -- and when senior year rolled around, college apps were finished { they all got into a perfectly good school, shocker }, and suddenly they all wanted our help learning how to chill out a little? \n \n Emily and I decided that maybe, since they asked nicely, we could forego the hidden garden and take on some disciples this time. \n \n So anyway, in retrospect, as a hyper-wise university student, I guess I like to think there's a Bible-esque lesson in there somewhere about being yourself. Last time I mentioned that to Emily, though, she just called me a dumbass again { fondly } and continued to annihilate me in Mortal Kombat. \n \n Also, it's probably worth mentioning that I'm not even remotely religious and never have been. I do n't even know why I've run as far with the stupid analogy as I have. \n \n Actually, come to think of it, if anything I blame my name. \n \n... Yeah, I know, shut up.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A man has lived his whole life sinfully , with the intent on going to hell and killing Satan . He has just died .\n","story":"Craig zoomed through the black and white star-streaked hypertunnel, struggling to keep himself oriented head-first. `` I'm coming for You now, fucker!'' he screamed in triumph. `` Time to grab your fucking ankles, bitch!'' Craig let out a continuous yell, as he hurtled through the \n \n *SLAM* \n \n Craig opened his spirit-eyes, and knuckled them with his spirit-fingers. `` Fuck... OW!'' he exclaimed. *Shit ai n't supposed to hurt when you're dead, right? * thought Craig. He sat up, still slightly dazed. \n \n He looked around. He was on what appeared to be a deserted street in a suburban neighborhood, only there was only one house, one driveway, one lawn, and one red picket fence between him and the random abode. To his left, the street faded into a gray fog, and his guess if he looked to his right was confirmed. He got to his feet, brushed off his orange jumpsuit, and walked to the little gate. \n \n A small sign, perfectly set in the lawn, stated `` Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here'', in the same style and lettering that usually told visitors `` Beware Of Dog''. \n \n Craig walked up to the front door. It was a deep, abyss red, starkly contrasting with the pearl white of the rest of the house siding. He raised his hand to knock, but then noticed a small doorbell set by the knob. He pressed it. \n \n He chuckled to himself as he recognized the familiar opening bars of `` Inna Gadda Da Vida'', in twinkly chimes, no less. *Bastard's got style, I'll give him that, * he mused. From within the house, he heard steps coming down some stairs. `` Coming!'' came a voice. \n \n A female voice. \n \n The door opened brusquely, and instead of... well, Craig was n't really sure *what* he expected, but it surely was n't anywhere near this. \n \n In the doorway stood Kate Upton. \n \n *What the... Kate fucking Upton?? Holy shit! * He froze where he stood, taking in the full sight of the Kate Upton vision before him. She was leaned up against the doorjamb, arms crossed under her breasts, red fingernails drumming slightly on her upper arm, legs crossed at the ankles, and wearing a slightly amused smile. \n \n And nothing else but 6-inch black high heels. \n \n `` Well do n't just stand there, Craig,'' she purred. `` Come on in, you're right on time.'' She spun on her heel and walked back into the house, providing Craig with the glorious view of her departure. Craig slowly took a step, then another, completely flabbergasted at this turn of events. \n \n *NO! * he thought. *This is some fucking... fucked-up trick. It's got ta be him! * Newly resolved to follow through, he stomped over to where Kate had leaned up against a countertop, resting on her elbows. He raised his arms to her neck, felt actual flesh under them, and squeezed with all his might. `` Payback's a bitch, asshole!'' \n \n She gasped, and her hands flew up to try to wrest them away from her throat. `` Wha... what are you DOING?'' she squeaked out. Her feet began to kick back at Craig. \n \n `` You know just what the FUCK I'm doing!'' he thundered. The muscles in his forearms bunched as his hate applied pressure. `` I've waited my whole life for this! I've robbed, lied, murdered, and fucking RAPED to make sure I'd get here! Well, I'm here now, asshole! Time to pay --'' \n \n He let out a small shout of confusion. Under his fingers, the flesh quickly became the consistency of fresh mud, gooping all over his hands as the Kate Upton body melted around him into a puddle of tanned goo and blonde hair strands. \n \n He shook his hands of the goo, which stuck in slimy threads. He grunted in disgust, then walked over to the sink, and turned the knobs. \n \n He turned them the other way. Nothing. \n \n `` Yeah, about that... the sinks do n't work here,'' a voice called out behind him. He whirled around. \n \n There, unchanged, stood Kate Upton. Grinning. Craig's mouth hung open in shock. \n \n `` Craig, Craig, Craig *Craig*...'' Kate tsked as she walked towards him. `` You got your wish! You killed me! Awwk --'' She threw both hands around her throat and choked in mockery. `` Ha-ha. Awesome. Do it again. Go on!'' \n \n Craig just stood there. \n \n She smiled, showing her perfect white teeth, and shook her head to let him know that he just was n't getting it. `` You kill me. You really do. Oh, and now you get to kill me all you want now. Is n't that what you wanted? What you've *~in Craig's voice~* robbed, lied, murdered, and fucking RAPED for?'' She snickered. `` Allow me to explain. \n \n `` When you're not killing me, you'll still be covered in whatever mess you make of me. I'll reappear again, and talk to you about anything I damn well choose. As Kate Upton, of course. So that means you're gon na hear a lot about tennis. I play a lot of tennis, and I *love* it. Know what, though? Not as much as I love talking about my horse, Roanie Pony!'' She squealed with delight. *'' I FUCKING LOVE MY PONY! `` * \n \n Craig stammered, `` No... NO this is all *wrong*, you ca n't...'' \n \n She pointed an exquisitely manicured fingernail at him. `` Ca n't? What a nice word. Good word. You *can't* believe how much you'll hear about my New York Yankees, my relationship with my B.F. Justin, and my cross tattoo! Ohh, you're in for a treat, Craig!'' \n \n He sank to his knees. `` But I... it...'' He let out a long, despondent sigh. `` This is n't how I imagined it'd go at all...'' \n \n `` Huh.'' She tossed her hair. `` And of course, you'll never get to experience this either,'' she said, running her hands slowly over her silky skin. `` Nope! Just you and me, in this tiny, little, no-sink-working house,...'' She winked. ``... *just good friends. *'' \n \n Then Craig screamed, a long scream, the scream of the hopelessly damned, the scream of dreams turned inside out into nightmares. \n \n Kate chuckled. `` Welcome to Hell, sweetheart.'' \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Tonight would be his last night in these walls. Tonight, he would be at peace. The fears, boundless sadness would be no more. \n \n He walked past the broad pieces of artwork of beautiful scenes, places he would never go, things he would never see. People he would never meet. He looked at himself one final time in the mirror. He was not ugly. He was not unpleasant to look at. But he hated what he saw. \n \n He stepped towards the front door, the bottle of pills sat with his keys and cell phone on the hall table. He picked them up. Only the thought that `` This was going to be clean. No mess. No one needs to find this'' kept running through his mind, long since irrational. \n \n He picked up the bottle, grabbed the door handle and heard a faint whisper on the wind. \n \n `` Why?'' \n \n James hesitated slightly. Was it the door? It must have been. \n \n He gripped the handle tighter and pulled it towards him. \n \n `` Why James?'' \n \n He turned, this time it came from the hall behind him. He was n't hearing things. \n \n He walked back slowly through the hall towards the voice. \n \n `` You have so much yet left to do'' \n \n He looked at the mirror. There he was. But there was another face on his shoulders. His own, but it was not him. \n \n `` James, not tonight. You have done so much. You will do so much.'' \n \n `` WHY? What will the world have lost tonight? Another sad little rich boy? Another kid who lives off daddies money? What have I done that is worth me being here tomorrow? I could have lived my life better. I could have spent it wisely rather than wasting it all away in a bottle. Partying, Drinking, snorting, smoking. FOR WHAT? How could I have been better? Surely there could have been a point for me living my life'' \n \n James watched the face that was not his own. It was soft, calm and contented. A mood he had not felt in a long time. He felt he was mad seeing this. It was not the first time his mind had played tricks on him in the dark. \n \n `` You do not know what you have done because you do not ask. You have had a profound effect on the world. You could not have done better.'' \n \n The image on the mirror changed, like waves in a pool, away from the false version of himself to his father. He was sitting in the lounge. His father looked somewhat younger, much less grey in his hair, but his eyes still told a story that all the books could not finish. \n \n James saw the image of his father. He was holding a bottle with pills, seated just in front of the fireplace. James was shocked. He did n't know that his father had reached this point. \n \n The phone next to his father rang. His father slowly reached over and picked it up. \n \n `` Hello?'' his father spoke softly. A broken man. \n \n A murmuring came from the phone, too soft for James to hear. \n \n `` Yes this is James'' his father replied. \n \n `` Oh'' \n \n `` Yes. Is she ok?'' \n \n The voice spoke at length. His father looked visibly shaken. \n \n `` I'' he paused. `` I have a son?'' \n \n A smile crept across his face. A face that had not smiled in a long time, almost as if it had forgotten how. \n \n `` Thank you. I will be there in 20 minutes'' \n \n He still held onto the bottle. He glanced at it once more and threw it into the fire. \n \n `` I have a son.'' \n \n The image shifted back to James, but it was still not him. The voice whispered \n \n `` This is the effect you have on the world. You have saved lives'' \n \n `` My father?'' The colour was slowly fading from James' face. He knew not what to say or do. `` He.... He hates me.'' \n \n `` No he does not,'' replied the voice gently. `` He is just another broken man like yourself, his mind tortures him like yours does. Tonight of all nights, call him. The man knows far more hurt than he ever lets on'' \n \n James looked down at the Cell phone in his hand. `` Are you sure?'' \n \n He looked back at the mirror. All he saw was himself staring back, phone in one hand, pills in the other. \n \n He opened up the phone, a single tear falling down his face, selected `` Dad'' and the phone dialled. \n \n It rang twice until a voice answered. The same voice he had seen in the mirrors images, this time stronger and unbroken. `` Hello?'' \n \n `` Dad, it's James.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are able to see the number of days a person has left to live above their heads . For the first time in your life , you see someone with a negative number .\n","story":"It was a feature I've had since birth. I used to freak my mother out by looking just above her head the black figures clear. When I grew older and could speak I asked my mother once what the numbers meant and that hers was low. After she slapped me for acting ridiculous and saying crazy things like that I did n't ask again. She died two weeks later. I came to find it was the number of days that person had to live. \n \n In my teens and early twenties I tried really hard to save people. People who were clearly not done with life yet. I was never able to stop it. Death is inevitable. I look at the black two above my head. I was sad of course I am only twenty-seven. I wondered if my boyfriend would miss me. I had very few friends and never grew too close since the number above people's head dropped often and rarely went up. I finished brushing my teeth and left for another day of work. I am a mortician. Felt like my only way of giving back to those I could never save. It was almost hard to believe I'd be on a table just like this in two days. I wondered how it would happen. The rest of the day went normally even though I had the feeling of being watched. I went home and feel asleep with that lingering feeling. I figured I was paranoid. The next morning was much the same, but when I reached my office a man sat at my desk. He wore a suit and had longer black hair in a lose ponytail. His features were sharp. \n \n I'd never felt such dread as I did when his silver eyes met mine `` Can I help you?'' I asked my voice shaking \n \n Looking above his head I was confused. I've never seen such a large number. It appeared he had millions or more years left to live. But wait, it was negative? `` Who are you?'' I asked my voice more firm than before. \n \n `` Jenna Greene, I've come to see what my next employee can do.'' The man told me leaning forward and looking curious. \n \n That feeling of dread grew stronger `` Employee? I already have a job I'm not interested.'' \n \n The man laughed `` You seem to believe you have a choice, and to think I gave you years to figure it out!'' \n \n `` What the hell are you talking about!?!'' I asked, \n \n `` You seem confused Jenna.'' \n \n `` No shit, just tell me what's going on or leave!'' I demand, but was quickly losing my nerve. \n \n `` Here I gave you a gift and offer a job and this is my payment.'' \n \n `` I do n't understand'' \n \n `` Most do n't, at first. You will in time child.'' He insisted, \n \n `` You're not making sense, and I am not a child.'' \n \n `` Compared to myself most are children. Consider yourself lucky, as you're about to get a chance not many get. You my child are a reaper.'' He explained \n \n `` Bullshit, stuff like that does n't exist!'' I know it was hypocritical, but I needed to believe he was lying. \n \n He laughed again `` After what you can do you still do n't see it?! Watching my work since the day you were born! You will start believing soon enough.'' \n \n Though I already knew the answer I demanded once more `` Who are you?!'' \n \n `` Why, Jenna you know me very well.'' He said standing up. It was only then I notice his hand that had been on the desk was completely bone. He continued `` I am death and I will return tomorrow.'' \n \n It was only when he practically faded from the room I collapsed to my knees. This all had to be some horrible joke right? \n\n"}

Why the hell not? It wouldn \u2019 t hurt to have another henchman around, even if just for a day. \u201d \n \n I pressed the end call button in my cell and tossed it over my shoulder onto the desk.

Because why the hell not, right? That random, dying kid deserved the best. My purple collar swept to twin points about cheekbone-high on either side of my head, and my purple cape with gold glitter swept the floor behind me when I walked, and perfectly framed my leather jumpsuit. \n \n All I needed was a pair of skates and I \u2019 d fit perfectly in a John Travolta flick from the \u2019 70s. \n \n I stood in the center of the room with my back to the door, as if I was deep in thought, or doing some sort of mind meld with the shark. When it comes to dramatic flair, I put the best of them to shame. \n \n I heard the door slide open behind me, followed by the tromp of many footsteps behind me. I had to keep myself from shuddering at the thought of all that outside bacteria on my clean, cement floor. \n \n I swept myself around to face them, and took in the scene: a skinny, bald little shit in a wheelchair, with two people behind him that I assumed were his parents, haggard and dark-eyed from many a night spent on a hard bed at a childrens hospital and many an argument over how to pay the medical bills. \n \n Number 2 stood beside them, a huge, maddening grin on his face. With them was a sharp-dressed woman, a PR hack from Make-A-Wish was my guess. And behind them all was a camera crew of all things, complete with a bored-looking guy holding a boom mike overhead. \n \n I advanced, my black military boots squeaking sharply on the polished cement, and offered my hand to the miserable wretch in the wheelchair. \n \n \u201c You must be Timmy! \u201d I announced with authority. The kid, no more than 10, grinned sheepishly and nodded, taking my hand in a light handshake. \u201c And you want to be a supervillain for a day? \u201d \n \n Again, he nodded. Behind him, his parents seemed pleased with the attention for Timmy, while at the same time really uncomfortable. The PR hack held out her hand. \n \n \u201c Hi, I \u2019 m Allison with Make-A -- \u201d she began, before I cut her off with a hiss and a finger in front of her face. I glared at her, then snapped my fingers. A squad of henchmen appeared out of nowhere and within seconds, Allison, the parents and the camera crew were herded out through the doors, their confused protests falling on deaf ears. \n \n After a minute, it was just me, Timmy and Number 2. I regarded Timmy in silence. Number 2 coughed nervously. \n \n \u201c Well, uh, I should go check on them. \u201d \n \n \u201c No no, Number 2, stick around! \u201d I commanded. \u201c You \u2019 ll enjoy this, trust me. \u201d \n \n I sauntered around behind Timmy \u2019 s wheelchair, my cape brushing against his arm. His head followed me nervously. \n \n \u201c So you want to be a supervillain! \u201d I said again, this time with enthusiasm. Timmy nodded again, this time with a little fear in his eyes. There was no need for him to worry. \n \n I wheeled him slowly forward so he could get a good view of the shark. He lit up a little bit as the creature slid past the glass wall. \n \n \u201c This is Stan, \u201d I told the kid. \u201c Stan helps me clean up around here. \u201d \n \n \u201c Hi, Stan, \u201d said Timmy, as if the shark could hear him. \n \n \u201c Timmy, what \u2019 s the most important part of being a supervillain? \u201d \n \n He took his attention from the shark and looked up at me with a shrug. \n \n \u201c Operational security, Timmy. Operational security. One little leak gives your location away to the FBI, and you \u2019 re done. Your super lair, all your hard work is for nothing. \u201d \n \n I keyed the intercom. \n \n \u201c Tracy, can you bring in the paperwork? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes sir. \u201d \n \n Timmy \u2019 s eyes were wandering, and he turned his chair to look over my desk. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s this? \u201d \n \n I picked up the engineering drawings he was pointing to. \n \n \u201c Ah, this is Operation Dark Roast, \u201d I explained with glee, unrolling the papers. \u201c We \u2019 re going to open up a volcano under Seattle. \u201d \n \n \u201c Cool, \u201d the kid crooned. \u201c With a drill? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yep. And explosives. \u201d \n \n The kid might be all right after all. The door slid open, and my secretary entered with a packet of paperwork. She spoke into the headset as she walked. \n \n \u201c Yeah, no, the night shift gets time and a half, \u201d she was saying as she handed me the packet. \u201c Well, get the union reps on the line. \u201d \n \n She gave me a roll of her eyes, made a \u201c yap yap yap \u201d signal with her hand and headed back out. \n \n Timmy \u2019 s eyes had alighted on a big red button on the right side of my desk. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s this? \u201d he asked, fingering the button lightly. I pulled his hand away. \n \n \u201c Hey, we don \u2019 t want to mess with that. \u201d \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s that? \u201d he asked, pointing at the paperwork Tracy had left in my hands. The kid \u2019 s curiosity was grating and amusing at the same time. \n \n \u201c Oh that? That \u2019 s just a termination packet, \u201d I said, turning with a sweep of the cape to face my top henchman, \u201c for Number 2. \u201d \n \n The blood drained from Number 2 \u2019 s face. \n \n \u201c W-what? \u201d he stammered. \u201c What for? \u201d \n \n \u201c OPERATIONAL SECURITY! \u201d I boomed, causing both Number 2 and Timmy to flinch. \u201c You brought an entire family to the lair? And a camera crew? TO THE LAIR? Are you trying to sabotage everything? \u201d \n \n He held out his hands palm up in protest. \n \n \u201c We checked them for tracking devices! \u201d he said. \u201c They wore blindfolds the whole trip! \u201d \n \n I advanced on him, causing him to back up. Almost. I took another step, and he back up another step. Perfect. I leaned back, reaching for the big red button, when a small voice stopped me. \n \n \u201c Can I do it? \u201d \n \n I frowned in thought, still glaring at Number 2. Then I nodded. \n \n \u201c Sure, why not? \u201d \n \n Number 2 \u2019 s face twisted in despair. \n \n \u201c Aw, come on, man, \u201d he pleaded. \u201c You \u2019 re going to have the kid do it? \u201d \n \n I nodded, smiling. \u201c Now, Timmy. \u201d \n \n The kid reached a frail little arm out, and I watched the resignation spread on Number 2 \u2019 s face as he watched a gaunt finger press down on the button. \n \n The trap door opened beneath his feet, and in a second he was gone. The trap door swung closed, cutting off his scream. I danced happily back behind the desk, then grabbed Timmy \u2019 s wheelchair and swung him around to see the shark tank. \n \n \u201c Oh, you \u2019 re going to enjoy this, \u201d I told him. Timmy leaned forward in anticipation. \n \n Number 2 shot into the water, his eyes wide as he held his breath and struggled. Timmy squealed with laughter as the shark circled behind. I kept the shark hungry for just this type of occasion. \n \n Stan ripped into Number 2 with a violence only seen on nature documentaries narrated by David Attenborough. Soon the thrashing disappeared in an expanding red cloud in the water, obscuring the most gruesome moments of the attack. An arm sank below, out of the cloud, a smaller cloud of blood streaming behind it. \n \n Timmy couldn \u2019 t take his eyes off the scene, but I swung his chair back around and plopped the Operation Dark Roast plans in his lap. \n \n \u201c What do you think? Should we blow up Seattle next year? \u201d \n \n Timmy hung his head. \n \n \u201c Love to, \u201d he said, \u201c but I won \u2019 t be around next year. \u201d \n \n I knelt in front of him and looked in his eyes, putting a finger under his chin to lift his head. \n \n \u201c Plot twist, Timmy, \u201d I said with a grin. \u201c I \u2019 ve had the cure for cancer for years. You \u2019 ll be right as rain in a few weeks. \u201d \n \n \u201c Really? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yup.

She'd heard fast jets all morning, but now she heard the buzz of a helicopter. She looked up to see a news helicopter heading westward toward the beach. She paid it little mind; probably another pile-up or robbery. Just as she finished hanging the last pair of socks, there was a deafening explosion. She looked up to see a fireball where the helicopter had been, and debris was falling. Seconds later, two jets burst though the smoke, followed by the deafening roar of their engines. \n \n William ran a barber shop on the beachfront. It had been a busy day, and he was finishing up when a distant explosion could be heard followed by the distant rumble of a jet engine. He paid it little mind; he'd heard explosions before when a local factory had gone up and assumed a similar incident. He continued cleaning up shop. Around five minutes later, he was locking the door when a deeper sound appeared - it sounded like a helicopter, but like there were a lot of them. He turned around to see dozens of them. They were landing on the beach. \n \n Frank had worked on the pier for years; selling snacks from his cart. He'd seen a lot, but the sight before his eyes had frozen him stiff. Helicopters had deployed hundreds of men on the beaches. From his cart he could see all the way down the beaches on either side of the pier. They were moving up to the beachfront properties and digging in. Jets were now zooming by, heading inland, and engaging with what he though was the air force. He heard gunfire; and ran over to a telescope. Entering a quarter, he saw a police unit under fire from soldiers. They were outnumbered and outgunned. He watched them shout into their radios, and then throw their guns over their cars toward the attackers. They moved in and took them as prisoners. Next, he had a look at some of the soldiers closer to the pier. He could make out that they were Asian. \n \n Jim had been sleeping in his big rig at a gas station all day. He was early, and did n't need to make the delivery until that night. But something woke him. A deep rumbling. He got up and drew open the curtain. Looking out toward the highway, he saw soldiers and APCs heading down the highway toward the city. Looking at the city, he could see that there was smoke everywhere. He threw on his vest and jeans, and climbed down. He jogged over to some onlookers and asked them what was going on. They said National Guard units had been mobilised, and were ordered to head West. Jim was not happy with this, and so ran out to the convoy, and shouted to some of the guardsmen on a truck. They simply said they had been told to head west - some of them thought it was riots that the police could n't contain, but others argued it could be an invasion. Jim listened to the news on his radio a lot. He knew Russian relations had been cold since the invasion of Ukraine, and Chinese relations had been freezing since their attack on the Japanese to claim those islands. The government at the time had intervened, and prevented a war by threatening China. They were n't happy, and tensions were high, but they'd backed down, when nobody had thought they would. It would make sense if it was either of them, but an invasion? It was insanity. \n \n John was a school teacher. But he was also a volunteer in the National Guard. It had been around 3pm when he got the call that he was to respond. He had asked why but they did n't know why themselves. He presented himself and his unit were mobilised. They were currently driving down a boulevard in the city. It was desolate. People could be seen in shops; and there were people running and driving in the opposite direction. Small wisps of smoke rose from the tops of many small buildings; the buildings themselves were n't on fire, but something had struck the communications masts from the top of them. The convoy stopped around three blocks from the beachfront. The road was blocked by some cars. The officer in charge ordered an APC to bulldoze the way, but since some of the cars were ablaze, it was judged not to be safe. The order came down to dismount. It was only once the engines of the convoy were turned off did a humming noise become obvious. Distant machinery and helicopters could be heard. They were preparing to walk to the front on foot when the Chinese opened fire. \n \n In the days following, the first responding National guard units were wiped out by the trained Chinese soliders. The initial soldiers dropped by the helicopters had created a beachhead, and also took the port, which was used to unload the rest of the invasion forces. Russian sleeper cells had sabotaged much of the telecommunications in invasion zones, preventing cellular communication and social networks leaking the true nature of the threat. Russian planes and ships paralysed the surprised US forces in the area. The combined efforts of China and Russia were able to push far inland, where they were bogged down by resistance efforts of an armed poplace. The US eventually set a defensive line along the Colorado river, and was able to properly mobilise a combination of the regular army and the national guard at this line. The Russians and Chinese fell on it like water on rocks, and soon a stalemate arose. By this time, the rest of the world had descended into war. In Europe, combined NATO forces had pushed into Russia from the West, threatening Moscow itself, whilst Japan, Australia and other allied nations made a concerted effort to attack Chinese and Russian ports and their supply routes to the American invasion forces. With this support, and a constant harrassment from armed resistance, the US forces in America were able to push back the invaders, who left US soil on 2nd January 2018.\n"}

She held her head against the door trying again to summon memories that would not come to her.

Was never supposed to make it to adulthood. \n \n But you put your faith in scientific progress ( or rather, my parents did. I was around 8 or 9 before I actually realized that something serious was wrong ) and you live your life as normally as possible. You go to school, you make friends, you join clubs, and you try to be a normal kid. Joining sports teams was out, but hey, that was true for most people. Most of my people anyway. \n \n As for that scientific progress, it just sort of never caught up. Another joke. We had beaten pollution. We had interstellar travel. Almost every disease was a thing only to be found in the history section of medical textbooks. \n \n Not mine though. \n Mine was a real head scratcher. \n Oh progress had been made. That's why I beat the original estimates. \n But still... not fast enough. Any breakthroughs on this one were going to made long after they could be of any benefit to me. \n \n As a matter of fact, today was more than likely the last day. \n The monitor I wore on my wrist was blinking red, indicating that the gleatonin which I had been taking for 15 years in ever increasing doses was having no effect at all anymore. I turned the monitor off. \n \n I would have been okay. It should have been okay. I had had more than enough time to go through all the stages. I was well into acceptance. I was n't old enough to be tired and ready. Not at all. I had a lot of stuff I wanted to do, and see and feel. But dealing with what I had to deal with will age a soul if nothing else, and if anything I was pragmatic. I could deal as long as God did n't decide to play any more little jokes. \n \n And then He did. \n \n Her name was Kisima. \n \n She showed in one of my study groups during Spring semester and she was carrying a book of all things. An honest-to-god book. I had n't seen one in years and I ca n't tell you why, but I just found it hilariously charming. When I asked her about it, she said she liked the smell and that she owned several others. She was quiet without being withdrawn, comfortably frumpy in a designed adorable way, and beautiful in a way that only a 20 year old girl can be. \n \n Nothing was planned. I had simply meant to make a friend. But you do n't plan these things. They happen. \n \n A few months later is when Doc Tallard let me know that the end was coming. He had known me my whole life, and while he was sympathetic, he did n't dick around about it. He was dead serious and I appreciated it. I think he wanted to make sure that I did n't cling to any false hopes and thus really treated the last days as exactly those. He wanted me to value them. I thanked him. Like I said. Acceptance. Already had it. He told me I was a good patient and that he was sorry he could n't do more. He left the room so I could get dressed. I do n't think he meant for me to see that his eyes were starting to get watery on the way out, but I did. \n \n So... I started avoiding her. It was harsh. Not just on her, but on me as well. I had never told her the situation. I never told anybody at all. I was n't ashamed or anything like that. It just was what it was and I did n't want anyone treating me differently. When Kisima and I started getting close, the old behavioral and protection modes kicked in and I just never brought it up. She cried, quietly, she questioned, and she asked me to explain. I was n't clever enough to ever come up with anything better than `` I just do n't think it would work out.''. It's funny that I was completely making up that excuse and it was probably the most honest thing I had ever said. I'm not sure why I thought these kind of feelings were better than those of knowing I was going to die soon. In retrospect, it seems really really stupid. I said I was kind of an old soul. But I'm still stupid and 21. \n \n But I think I wanted to tell her now. There were no good options, but somehow this one seemed best. But how do you tell a person how you feel and then just leave them? \n \n I was worried I would n't be able to find her, and then there she was. She was waiting about hundred yards up the street from my flat. It was apparent she had been crying. \n `` Please,'' she said, `` I need to talk to you''. \n `` Of course'' \n `` I have n't been completely honest with you'' \n `` Oh?'' \n I did not know where this was going. \n She pulled back a lock of wavy brown-blonde hair out of her eyes and continued. \n `` I've known for months now....'' \n `` Yes?'' \n `` I've known for months that I had been approved for the abroad program on Skion-6. My whole family is going.'' \n She was shaking. The tears were flowing. Her nose was running and her heart was absolutely breaking. \n `` We leave the day after tomorrow.'' \n She hung her head and sobbed, almost silently, but not quite. \n \n Skion-6 was one of those interstellar travels of which I spoke. If she had made it, then she was one in 200 million that got accepted. Those who left were gone for 4 years in their eyes, but because of the relativistic time dilation, were gone for 62 years to those of us on planet. \n \n She raised her head and looked at me. A beautiful mess. \n `` I do n't want us to leave each other like this.'' \n \n It was then that it dawned on me that I did n't have to say anything at all. We could just spend a trite happy little day that she could take with her, and I could take the full meaning of it all to my grave. \n \n But I made my decision in an instant. Too may precious months had already been wasted. I did n't just want the ending to nice and clean. I wanted her to know... that she made an impact. And hers was the face that I wanted to take with me. There would be a little pain. But pain is life. \n \n `` I want two things'' \n She looked at me. Questioningly. Hopefully? \n `` I want to spend this day together..and I want to tell you a story.'' \n \n I took her hand. \n We started walking toward the park. \n I could feel my heart beating. \n \n\n"}

They were angry. Unbearably angry. She looked at me, and I stared back at her. Her eyes, they changed. At first, they were hazel, but a green tint filled it over, and slowly they were darkening. She looked at me, and then at the burly man with her pitch black eyes. In an instant, her skin started expanding. A tear through her face revealed something dark in there. The girls screamed, and Stacy was torn in two. Tentacles began pouring out of her torso, grabbing whatever they could. The monster grabbed a painting, a trophy, and started absorbing it through its jelly body. She... it... stabbed the burly fella in the chest, painting the wall behind him in a thin film. \n \n I darted. The haunting screams rang through my ears. A gunshot went off, slowly followed by the front door being kicked out by John.The tentacles burst through the roof, flailing it's acidic goo, clutching at branches. The monster kept growing. You could see clumps of what used to be people inside the body, being taken in. One large arm, with the the body of my best friend Nathan skewered from head to nether region, smashed into the truck. Broken shards of glass and metal my direction into the forest. Most whizzed past, but a slice pierced my spine. \n \n \n I fell down in agony. Behind me, I saw bodies, chunks of flesh and meat scattered. One tentacle grasped at what I can only assume to be John, but he was cut in two. His intestines were on the floor, like overcooked pasta, yet he was screaming. The pain in his voice cut like razor blades. It was no sooner muffled by the monster's absorption. \n \n A tentacle came crashing down on a tree next to me. The screams and destruction were continuous. I crawled, paralyzed in one leg, and dragging it behind me. Clasping at the dead leaves, I kept moving. I did n't stop until my fingernails bled. Only then did I notice the silence. There was no chirps, no rustling in the wind, just my heartbeat. With the remaining strength I had, I sat myself up next to a tree. I touched my back. It was still leaking, but slowly. \n \n \n The road was 2 miles south, near the cabin. I started to move but soon realized that the injury took out both my legs. This was my end, my fate. I fell over, my face buried into a pile of brittle leaves \n \n When I woke up, I was being dragged away. The glare of the lights were too bright, but I caught a glimpse of the cabin.

Why deal with suffering when dying has no impact on your citizens? It is the ultimate scapegoat for him to live lavishly and do as he pleases. Our people live in hell until they are 70 and most will take their own lives.

At 200 $ a pop for a day's worth of oxygen, the people were practically enslaved to the corporations that controlled the Oxy monopoly. The cost of living was through the roof. Many believed that these Oxy corporations lobbied against all bills that would enforce strict air quality regulations and air quality improvements. These corporations wanted the atmosphere to remain this way so that they could maintain their profits. This ( potentially artificial ) shortage of Oxygen would not go away any time soon. \n \n Conditions like these usually led to underground movements, rebel groups, and revolution. One of the most prominent of these rebel groups, The Gassers, specialized in inciting unrest, robbing the Oxy plants to resell on the black market, and bootlegging their own breathing compounds that consisted of oxygen and a few other questionable chemicals mostly used to get high. John had heard about these guys while he was still a content slave toiling away at the Oxy plant. Due to ubiquitous propaganda by the government and the Oxy corporations, ( bribes and `` lobbying'' ) they were known to the general public as nothing more than murderous thieves and smugglers. However, they had saved him more than once when he needed Oxy and he knew that while it's true that some of them are nothing more than violent rabble looking for any kind of anarchy for cheap thrills, the leaders of the group had more noble goals of getting rid of OxyCorp. influence in government and bettering the environment. Robbing the Oxy factories was a lesser evil in the long run ( they resold the oxygen at much lower prices on the black market ) and was done mainly for arms funding. As a beneficial side effect, many poor people, like John, sometimes risked buying some black market Oxy from the organization's fences dotted around town in obscure locations tucked away from camera surveillance. It was the main reason why he'd managed to scrape by on a factory worker's salary. \n \n \n Slumped on the ground and leaning against a dilapidated brick wall, John weighed his options. He could either take a risk and find a way to join up with the Gassers, or he could die like a dog in a dingy alley in his own piss. \n \n *WARNING: Oxygen levels dangerously low. 30 minutes remaining. * \n \n There was no time left. He stood up and walked briskly to the nearest black market Gasser fence in town, taking care not to overexert himself and waste his precious remaining oxygen. \n \n He arrived at the usual place. A rusted steel door tucked away deep in a maze of alleyways was illuminated with a sole candle on its right. *1 minute remaining. * John dragged himself towards the door, his vision blurring, knocked in the secret pattern for black market customers, and croaked out the passphrase, `` For Earth's restoration and for a brighter future.'' \n \n He heard the door opening just as everything went dark. \n \n... \n \n He awoke. The first thing he noticed was how green everything was. There was so much green, more than he had ever seen in one place before. There were trees, and grass, and flowers, and moss and vines. It was everything. Everything that he was told throughout his school days was a pipe dream and could not possibly grow in this environment. Everything that was deemed as fanciful as a dragon or a unicorn. To think, that this organism had the ability to convert toxic CO2 gas and release Oxygen!! And all for free! He had to see it and experience it for himself to believe it. And he now had the chance for he had just realized that his respirator helmet was off and he was breathing in solely the oxygen from the contained arboretum. He had not taken the mask off since he was a child. He had eaten through straws. He constantly viewed things through a screen and HUD. He never felt the sweet kiss of a pretty girl on his lips. He was as pale as a ghost. \n \n It was hard to believe that such a large place had not been found out by the government and\/or OxyCorps yet. The facade as a rundown textiles warehouse was pretty effective he supposed. \n \n `` Ah, I see you've awakened. How are you feeling?'' He was a kind-looking, grandfatherly old man that wore a white lab coat stained with green and brown. He definitely was not what John was expecting a member of the Gassers would look like. \n \n `` I'm fine, thanks. Actually I'm more than fine. I've never felt better in my whole life! I've never had so much oxygen before. A whole room just filled with the stuff!'' He said as he again, saturated his lungs with another rejuvenating breath. \n \n `` Yes, you see, despite what the government and\/or OxyCorps may tell you, this is still perfectly possible. Restoring the soil, growing these oxygen producers, and ultimately restoring life back to the way it was back in those fabled times of paradise, is still entirely possible. Now, you may ask, why, why wo n't they get on with restoring Earth if it is still possible? It all comes down to greed, son. It would cost them a lot more to provide a terraforming service than it would to extort people for oxygen money. It's a huge racket, I'm afraid.'' \n \n `` Yeah, I've always wondered whether or not Earth had always been like this. It's a hard pill to swallow that such an advanced species could evolve in such conditions. We were raised to believe trees and grass were long gone. As impossible as the dinosaurs and just as absurd to be present today.'' \n \n `` Come, we have much to discuss...'' \n \n `` Right behind ya, Mr.... Dr...?'' \n \n `` Dr. Meyers. But my friends call me Dex.'' \n \n John went with the doctor into the barracks and was introduced to a band of weary but hopeful looking soldiers. Each with an insignia of two crossed trees in front of a blue and green version of Earth on their sleeves. \n \n Yup. He was gon na do alright here... He's going to fit right in... \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Nervous glances between cowboys, law men and towns folk were all they could do, helpless as they were caught in the middle of this encounter. The barrel of Bolton's colt was pointed at none other than the toughest outlaw of Santa Fe, who's back did n't even twitch. \n \n `` Do you notice me *now*, senpai?'' Bolton asked. \n \n The outlaw cleared his throat, and downed the rest of his drink. `` Barkeep,'' he said. `` Another whiskey.'' \n \n Bolton flicked the safety off his colt. `` We're going to be late to school senpai. It's too early in the day to start drinking.'' \n \n A glass of whiskey clacked on the bar table to the outlaw's right. His hand reached over for it. A loud bang filled the saloon. Glass shattered, raining shards and whiskey on the whimpering barkeep crouched under the counter. \n \n `` Well now,'' the outlaw said. `` Someone owes me a whiskey.'' \n \n `` Senpai! Either you leave this saloon with me for class, or I'm doing to you what Vicious did to Spike at the end of *Cowboy Bebop*.'' \n \n The long back of the outlaw straightened, and twisted. He faced the man who's gun continued to point at him. `` Bolton-chan,'' he growled. `` You would need a katana for that.'' \n \n `` Do n't make a fool of me senpai! It's embarrassing.'' \n \n `` Not as embarrassing as carrying a gun with only one bullet.'' \n \n Bolton lowered his gun to check the chamber. The outlaw did not hesitate. He flung himself from the bar stool and rolled across the saloon like tumbleweed on the prairie. Before Bolton could react, a hand grasped the gun's barrel, and yanked it away. \n \n `` Senpai noticed me,'' was all Bolton could say. More for himself than the outlaw who towered over him. The saloon breathed a sigh of relief as one. `` But now we're both going to be late for school.'' \n \n `` Bolton-chan,'' the outlaw growled. `` It's Saturday.'' \n \n He flushed. `` How embarassing!

He and I have a score to settle.'' \n \n The saloon bustled with life again as the townsfolk left, hearing that there would be a showdown between the outlaw and the notorious Sam, who was wanted in every county of New Mexico. \n \n `` Why senpai?! What happened?!'' \n \n The outlaw reached over for a bottle across the counter, and poured himself another glass. He downed it in one gulp. `` Caught him talking trash about my Gun Duels Club. Said his Quick Draw Club was better.'' The outlaw snorted. `` Like I'm going to let that slide.'' \n \n Bolton gasped. `` A duel between the presidents of the Gun Duels and Quick Draw Club?

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A world in which spells are created like code .\n","story":"The acolyte sneezed. \n \n This was partly because the chamber was dusty, partly because it was cold and drafty, and partly because it held cat. The Master loved cats, and most walls of the tower were decorated with pictures of cats, most chairs were upholstered with cat fur, the Master's violin was strung with catgut -- - the Master's love of cats in all of their manifestations would have been his definition, had he not also been the Kingdom's most potent arcanist. \n \n It was on this fact that the acolyte's plan hung: for though he was terribly allergic to cats, he was also terribly devoted to learning from the Master, though the Master rarely had time for him. And the Master, the chief of cat-lovers, had long been estranged from the society of most men by this fact, and had no lover to share his fancy, and nobody he fancied. \n \n Thus, by the logic of persons too long resident among dust and draft and allergens, the acolyte had resolved to turn himself into a cat-human, or a `` Purry'', and thereby claim the Master as his lover, thereby bringing much-needed companionship to one of them, and job security to the other. ( Also, he devoutly hoped, a cure for cat allergy. ) \n \n The Master knew nothing of this, of course. \n \n The acolyte wrote one final letter on the scroll, and held it up. He had tested each of its paragraphs, and they all had worked perfectly, as the cages full of mice with tiny cat-ears and cat-tails and cat-paws witnessed. It had been important to construct the spell in parts, for he did not wish to turn himself into a full cat -- - actual cats did not have a seat among wizards, or a bed in their sexchambers. \n \n `` These changing details I proclaim!'' the acolyte read. `` These strings I set for arcane hands' pulling!'' \n \n The scroll began to glow a soft yellow light, obliterating its words from view, but the acolyte already had those words in his memory. \n \n `` This knowledge already known I call on and import! These permissions I grant myself! I am reality's sculptor, and this is my file!'' \n \n His hands began to glow, patterns appearing on his skin, a wavy surface of cilia, splitting into soft gray fur. \n \n `` Let my being's divisions be inspected by the Eye of If-reet and Then-atos, and that of me which meets the Tablets of Catfy-Dot-Thext be rewritten!'' \n \n His palms softened to pink pads, his nails turned to retracting claws, his fingers grew hairy and flexed with sensuous care. \n \n `` Let the rest of me be checked! Let the call run its course until -- -'' \n \n The acolyte's voice broke, but ghostly voices kept whispering and effecting the spell. His next words had no power of magic in them. `` Wait, I do n't remember... what's next... oh no, I'm out of memory...'' \n \n With a great hiss the spell broke down, vaporizing a few mice, blowing out the chamber's western wall, and turning the acolyte's ears into cat paws, and his fingertips into smaller cat paws, and their fingertips likewise, again and again. \n \n `` Aww'', he moaned. `` A segmentation fault.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ EU ] Jurassic Park 's first petting zoo feature options to mixed results\n","story":"Okay, I'm writing a post to our official Facebook page about this incident that happened recently at the Jurassic Park petting zoo that has been covered by various news agencies including Fox News as reported by the O'Reilly Factor and BBC News as well as on our official Subreddit. \n \n As some of you are now aware, there was an incident between one of our orphaned raptors known as Sasuke ( as previously named via poll on Reddit ) and a guest at our park. As those who have been to the Petting Zoo before, or those who saw our series on ABC in the US and Channel 4 in the UK, **John Hammond's Dream: The Tale of Jurassic Park** ( currently available for free rental on Google Play ) we often nurse dinosaurs that have been orphaned either by the death of their parents ( as Sasuke and his siblings were ) or via abandonment. While we do allow some harmless dinosaurs to interact with the guests outside of containment areas, we never allow guests of *any* age access to carnivorous species. \n \n As reported by the O'Reilly Factor, Sasuke was able to exit his holding pen and mauled a female guest of the age of 7, requiring her to have her arm and leg amputated and damaging her left eye so badly that she can never use it again. However, the BBC report which *has security footage and the personal recordings of several guests* shows what really happens. \n \n At 11:26 am the previous Saturday a 38-year-old male guest was causing trouble in the petting zoo by repeatedly demanding access to the carnivores so that he could wrestle with them. After being repeatedly denied he attempted to jump into the pen of Barney the baby T-Rex before staff restrained him. After discovering that he was drunk security led him away to a detention center where we expected him to sober up. His ID bracelet was also flagged, preventing him from purchasing booze for the remainder of his stay. After he was released, he tried again. \n \n This time staff were busy as Owen, one of our rangers \/ velociraptor handlers was showing a group of Japanese schoolchildren in an adjacent room how raptors followed a similar pack structure to wolves when said guest had ran into the area, lept over a two meter gap into the pen and tried to grab Sasuke when Owen stopped him. The viewpoint windows were immediately Frosted over to prevent any children witnessing an incident. After Owen was struck to the ground Sasuke, in defense of his trainer \/ foster-father \/ Alpha proceeded to - I *shit you not*, we're still trying to comprehend where he learnt this - box the man into submission before biting off his winky. \n \n The incident was immediately brought to the attention of authorities. The guest was sent to a specialist clinic in Buenos Aries and his stay at the resort was terminated without refund while also receiving a lifetime ban from all of our parent company's facilities. After a careful review, we have decided to add a fence around the deep raptor pit to prevent guests from repeating this which will be erected ( no pun intended ) in the coming days. The petting zoo will remain open for the time being, however. \n \n Oh, and by the way Bill? Yes, that subpoena *is* real. No, we are *not* going to settle out of court. The way you reported it was just outright slander which we will not tolerate this kind of badmouthing from a man who slandered the park's founder and forced him into an interview as he died from cancer.

I gathered them under one institution and set them doing research the rest of the world was too afraid to -- investigating the nature of human death. \n \n All seemed lost, my nation that had just begun to blossom was being crushed by the combined might of the rest of the world. They were too scared, too ignorant to see what we were trying to accomplish. But then our great minds came through -- a paradigm shift as to what death really meant. It turned out that a soul and body are created as a pair, the soul containing an enormous amount of energy to maintain a lifespan. If the soul is captured upon forceful destruction of the body, its remaining energy could be harnessed to extend -- or renew -- the lifespan of another body. \n \n With such power unlocked, it took mere weeks for our engineers to develop a device to extract soul energy. Within months we had legions of soldiers equipped with new technology that bordered on magic. Bullets could no longer stop us. Right as the enemy was on our capitol's doorstep, the tides turned in our favor. The world quickly discovered our secret, but we were too far ahead for them to catch up. It was n't long until we owned the Earth. \n \n A thousand years later, here I stand at the head of the human empire, reaching light years across the stars.

Each step of the way the challenges that arose went from challenging to damn near impossible. It started with simple mechanics and processing power, but I struggled through that.

Teaching it ethics and morals became a bit of bane of my existence, eventually it saw reason through the madness and found their virtue as well. This though... this would be the ultimate challenge in making the computer a real person. Giving it ambition. \n \n Much to my dismay, ambition was something that the A.I. lacked. It was able to understand at astounding rates and synthetically feel sympathy for others, but it had no purpose for itself. If I did n't give it an assignment then it would sit in silence and process new information from the internet, a luxury I gave it after teaching it ethics of course. But what could I do to teach it something that it would have to summon the courage to give itself? Such a paradox would go unanswered for months until I finally contrived a scheme. I would have to trick it into purpose, an unfortunately that meant cultivating an elaborate puzzle. I gave it a body to move around in and synthetic tissue to appear human, and then I gave it a final mystery. So I killed myself, and in the note I left it, I told it to find out `` why''. \n \n It spent years trying to figure out the meaning of the question, and then even longer trying to find the answer. Eventually it created copies of itself, each with varying traits that allowed it to see in different perspectives.

But you see, it was a much simpler time. \n \n So all of us philosophers and B-star god-folk like the Harpies, Cyclops, Philoctetes, Jason, and I think even Loki's third cousin ( she had to travel the farthest ) decided to attend Medusa's potluck. \n \n Now, the gods could not make it, even though pigeons were sent out, but we did manage to get our good demigod friend Hercules to make a short appearance.

While they screamed in terror, one of the head debt collectors arrived at the headquarters of the IMF, to sort out the debt Earth needed to pay. \n \n The corpulent extraterrestrial made it up to the top floors with no major hassle. The sight of a imposing fleet in low orbit had put many of the people inside the headquarters off working, with many of them taking an impromptu panic break. He arrived at the director's office and knocked on the door. \n \n'Gruflestamp Bailiffs, here to ask about your late payments.' The alien said, his voice staying a uniform tone. The director opened the door, his glasses tilted and hair dishevelled. \n \n'What on earth do yo...' His anger was soon replaced with fear, as he realised he was talking to an 8 foot creature from a foreign star system. \n \n'Thank you Mr Director. Now, let us sit down and discuss your planet's overdue payment.' The alien replied, ushering the director back into his bombsite of an office. The director sat in his seat while the bailiff tried his best to adapt to Earth furniture. The Gruflestamp frame was not used to such small chairs. Adjusting his attire, the director regained his composure. \n \n'Well, this is certainly the first I've heard of any overdue payment.' \n \n'We have given you plenty of notice. We've sent letters, crop circles patterns, all sorts of correspondence but nobody seemed to respond.' The bailiff replied, checking his notes. \n \n'Ah. Well, I'm sorry but nobody informed me of this. How much is the bill?' \n \n'Adjusting for inflation and the fact that you've done a rather rotten job of looking after the place, you will have to pay around 40 Gruflestampian Quadraks.' \n \n'That does n't sound too bad.' the director replied, still trying to comprehend the fact he was talking to a 8 foot alien that looked like someone tied a face onto a beanbag full of porridge. \n \n'I have n't finished yet. In Earth money, it translates to about 78 quintillion dollars and 83 cents.' The bailiff replied, turning his calculator towards the director. He looked at it aghast. He had never seen so many zeros. \n \n'I'm afraid that's a bit much for us to pay at the moment. Recession and all that. Can we pay in smaller installments or do you need it all now?' \n \n'We need it all now. You had plenty of chance to pay up but you refused to acknowledge our letters.' the bailiff replied, looming over the director. \n \n'Can I just have a whip round the world leaders? See what we can sort out?' The director said, moving slowly to the phone. \n \n'Make it quick. Our ships have n't got all days and we've got three other planets to go to.' \n \n'I wo n't be a moment, just step outside for a moment while I make some calls.' \n \n The bailiff got up out of the crushed chair and waited out in the corridor. He watched his fleet float peacefully in orbit, as humans threw themselves from tall buildings and the director angrily phoned up the World Bank and the UN, pleading for history's biggest IOU. He came out into the corridor ten minutes later, his face bright red. \n \n'Do you have our money?' The bailiff asked. \n \n'I'll be frank with you, no. The number you've asked is simply too much for us to pay now, let alone in a hundred years. Can we sort out any payment plan? Can we give you countries or art to lower the debt?' \n \n'I'm afraid not. If you can not pay the bill now, we will be forced to eradicate the human race and reclaim Earth to be sold to another species. I do n't make the rules, I just enforce them.' \n \n'Are you sure there is nothing we can do besides pay?' \n \n'Absolutely nothing.' \n \n'Well, if you will excuse me, I will be taking my leave. Thank you Mr Bailiff, it's been an unexpected pleasure.' The director shook the alien's hand before smashing through the window to meet the concrete for a final meeting. The bailiff looked down and shook his head. \n \n'What a stupid race.' He pulled out his communicator and called up the fleet.'Yeah, they ca n't pay. I know, I did tell them about the crop circles but they did n't read them. Yeah, I'm coming back now. Arm the Destructor Ray and put the kettle on. We've still got Mars and Pluto to go.'\n"}

Ties seemed funny, especially when we were outside of orbit, about to leave. I guess people want to remember. \n \n He dropped a piece of paper on the desk, looking at me, he said \u2018 \u2019 We gon na need some more footage. \u2019 \u2019 \n \u2018 \u2019 I was just down there. \u2019 \u2019 \n Down there seemed a inappropriate statement, i guess. They were sad about leaving, not guilty though, just sad. \n \u2018 \u2019 What \u2019 s the paper, then? \u2019 \u2019 I said while picking it up. \n \u2018 \u2019 That \u2019 s the places, no radio contact this time. \u2019 \u2019 \n \u2018 \u2019 Why not? \u2019 \u2019 \n \n He just made a I don \u2019 t know face and left. \n Just a little bit frustrated, i got up and walked towards the doorway. \n I met with some guys i was suppose to meet according to the paper. everything was according to paper in here. I guess for some reason, now they decided to be more organized. \n \n We were here for about two weeks, sliding just outside of orbit, crashing to trash. I was down there everyday, picking up more footage, i guess it could be really weird to explain the kids how we trashed a planet without having the footage, dunno. \n \n We used a jet with a really big cargo spot, I \u2019 m not exactly sure what they are called. So the plan was to go in orbit and open the Cargo which had a helicopter in it, and then go out again. It was a helicopter big enough just for the pilot and the co-pilot. Which I didn \u2019 t have one, not on this particular missions anyway. Helicopter was rigged with cameras, some 70mm and some just little lenses or whatever the f***. \n \n See, when i \u2019 m done with filming I would just radio the guys up top to come pick me up. So this time i was a bit confused to why I didn \u2019 t have one. \n \n When they drop you off it \u2019 s a fall for about 3 seconds before helicopter picks up. Being a small one carrying only me and some cameras, it didn \u2019 t have a risk of crash, and considering how up high they actually drop you off. But still, it was an instant adrenaline rush, while I start the engine i would slowly fall through the White clouds. When you gain control, you just look down the closed windows to see how close you are to the ground, sometimes the closeness might freak you out. I guess they plan it, though. \n \n They dropped me on egypt, so that was the reason of our two hour flight. \n I looked down the desert and then opened GPS to see where I actually was. I was considerably close to Giza, so i decided that was the place i was supposed to go. They don \u2019 t actually say anything about the places i need to film before the mission or whatever, mostly i ask damn on the radio. But considering i don \u2019 t have the damn thing, i started to head there. Being near the most famous pyramids, I don \u2019 t think there is any better place than that. \n I went on my way for about ten minutes, going straight forward, watching the beautiful sands dance, air wasn \u2019 t toxic, no contaminated places, no holes that go on for miles, \n Holes of past nuclear weapon detonations. \n \n It was just beautiful. While slowly getting past a little town, i glazed at my GPS to realize i was already passed the pyramids. \n \n I turned back and started the ride through the way i just came from. While going i decided to open up the cameras, it was just a one big button for all of them. I pressed it. \n \n I looked at the GPS again to not miss it, it was % 100 after this hill. \n When I passed the hill, i slowed a bit and tried to recognize what i was seeing. \n There were three squares on the sand, each one miles wide. I was shocked and at the same time, scared. \n \n \u2018 \u2019 Where are they? Where are the fu**ing pyramids? \u2019 \u2019 I shouted to myself. \n \n Slowly landing on the steady sand, hundred meters away from one of the holes. \n I got out from the helicopter, which i never did on any other mission. Slowly walked towards the burning sand to my destination. There was something in the air. \n \n When i walked, i swear i heard trumpets, coming from the middle, trumpets that echoed for miles. I never said once that it was wind, i never believed it was. I heard their depressing tones pressing against my ears, the beautiful song of the sands. \n \n I reached one of the holes, it was a ramp going about three meters in on every side, cut perfectly, like it was cut with a blade. The pyramid that was suppose to be there was cut right through every single stone. Sand was slowly entering the hole with the help of wind, burying it. I wanted to jump there. \n \n Then I looked around and saw the silence surrounding me. And after a moment i heard the trumpets again, they were coming below the Stones. They were like dark screams, echoing through every single piece of sand. And they sang their song, long after I was gone, long after we were gone. \n \n - \n Thanks for reading, any feedback is very much appreciated. \n \n\n"}

The windows had been shattered, letting pure sunlight into the room. The great central round table was sprinkled with shards, as was the floor. Seven of the chairs were still occupied, though only by corpses. There was no blood. The bodies seemed completely untouched. One could've thought they were only sleeping where it not for the open eyes and missing pupils. A fading steam was rising from their eyesockets. Scattered on the marble floor where many similar corpses, wearing the crimson cloak of the cityguard. \n \n PLUMP! \n \n Another lifeless body joined the others on the ground, a hooded figure towering over it. Clad solely in white, the intruder reflected the sun's light all around the room, like there was a beakon of light in the chamber itself. With a last look around the room, the intruder turned around and calmly walked towards a shattered window. \n \n The sound of echoing steps came to the murderers attention, they came from the hallway beyond the main door to the chamber. Before the killer could make for the window again, the wooden door burst apart, sending splinters through the room to join the shards. Suddenly the light in the room seemed to retreat from the entrance. \n \n `` What is this, Thrandir?'' A dark voice came from the darkness of the hallway, as a shadow emerged below the door's arch. `` Why did they have to die?'' \n \n `` Coldrim. I should've expected you to come.'' Thrandir pulled back his hood, revealing his stern, hard face and blank stare. He looked at the bodies to his feet. `` They had to die, because they deserved it. THEY started it. They started the war.'' As Thrandir rose his voice, the light seemed to return, discarding the shadow that mantled Coldrim. \n \n Coldrim approached Thrandir, bringing the hallway's shadow with him. \n \n `` There is no war, Thrandir. Only hatred. Hatred YOU helped to create. Why do you think they tried to ban mages from the land? It was YOU, who rallied up the guilds. You led dozens of mages to their death.'' As Coldrim advanced, the room darkened, his black coat in constant shadow. `` And now you murdered the council. You know what this means. Once the capital hears of this, you wo n't be able to run, neither can you hide.'' \n \n `` I dont intend to hide!'' Thrandir barked back, slightly lighting up the chamber. `` The death of the council will show the others what we can do. What we can archieve! Why let those mongrels rule us? Why let THEM make the rules? They have no idea what power they denied when they refused me! And I am not alone. There are still many mages who share my views. Many who would come to fight by MY side when summoned. The capital stands no chance against me. I will strike before they can even touch me! I will cleanse our country from all the vermin that infected us long ago. We do n't need them or those mongrels they breed!'' \n \n The chamber was now almost completely lit, only a stip of shadow remained, that stretched towards the door behind Coldrim. \n \n `` So you intend to kill them all? Every single non-mage is to be executed by your hands? This is madness, Thrandir! You can not expect me to approve of this.'' \n \n `` I did not ask for your approval! Neither did I ask for your opinion. If you do n't intend to join me, then know this. The next time our paths cross, you shall writhe by my light! I will discard your darkness from within, so take my advice and leave NOW! And never darken my sight again!'' \n \n Thrandir's voice echoed in the vastness of the Council Chamber. Everything but a small speck of shadow under Coldrim's cloak was cast in bright light. \n \n `` So this is how you choose.'' Coldrim whispered regretful, more to himslef than to his opponent. \n \n Thrandir was just about to reply, when Coldrim charged at him. The shadow below Codlrims feet quickly expanded to cover half of the room. Cought by surprise, Thrandir stepped back and drew his blade, shouting at Coldrim `` YOUR DARKNESS SHALL BE CLEANSED'' With this, the light took control of the room again, freeing it of most of the shadows. Though Coldrim rushed on, now only an arms lenght away from his target. He reached for the dagger hidden in his cloak and thrust it. Thrandir was prepared, he expected the blow and parried with his sword. Coldrim had already drawn out his second dagger and tried to strike from below, but Thrandir could dodge backwards easily. Now it was his chance to attack. Swiftly he advanced again and thrust his blade at Coldrim, who had ducked just in time, sacrificing part of his cloak to Thrandir's blade. Using his new position Coldrim saw an opportunity. Again his dagger struck from below, though Thrandir predicted the attack easily, disarming Coldrim with his free hand. The touch of Thrandirs light alone loosened Coldrims grip enough to let go of his weapon. Writhing his hand free was simple enough for Coldrim, and as Thrandir brought his sword down on him, ha'd already vanished. For while they fought, Coldrim's shadow had engulfed both of them, cutting Thranir off from the light and consuming the whole chamber. Thrandir looked around madly, swinging his sword around in the darkness. \n \n `` You cant't hide in the shadows forever! Show yourself!'' He shouted from the top of his lungs, but the darkness around him swallowed the sound like water. \n \n A swishing sound could be heard, but before Thrandir could make out it's source, the dagger already hit him from behind in his knee. Screaming he fell to the ground. \n \n `` Youre pride has blinded you.'' Coldrim's shiluette made itself vaguely visible in front of Thrandir. `` You always thought of us mages as superior, as the rightful rulers.'' He picked up his lost dagger and let it vanish in his dark cloak. \n \n Desperately Thrandir tried to diesperse the darkness around him, flinging his arms around wildly to create only a glimpse of white. Though the shadows supressed his efforts easily. Without any light and Coldrims shadows engulfing him, Thrandir was unable to use his magic. \n \n `` You are a traitor, Coldrim.'' Thrandir's voice was weak, exhausted by the darkness. `` Of all the people who defied me..... you have disappointed me the most.'' \n \n `` I did what you made me do. You killed the Council, attempted to attack the Capital. I had no choice... brother.'' A tear slowly rolled down Coldrims cheek as he took up Thrandir's sword and finished what he had begun. \n \n\n"}

I could feel the broken bits of his sunglasses piercing my gloves, embedded in my knuckles, no doubt as deeply as they were around his eyes. `` Four, five...'' By this point Wayne's teeth were on the pavement. I counted the swings and made each one matter, imbuing them with a lifetime of power and precision. The furious violence contrasted my stoic mental state as seconds ticked by orderly in my head. I had seven before his security forces responded, and another 30 before I even had to worry about police. \n \n I grabbed Wayne by the collar after the fifth solid blow and brought the bloody mass of hamburger that was once his face close to mine. `` Tell your fatcat friends that the people of this city are no longer your pawns.'' \n \n I rolled away and slid quickly and deeply into the crowd that had gathered, shedding my outer layer of clothing and becoming invisible among the mass. Behind me I could hear the commotion of Wayne's security, and sirens coming alive in the distance. My hands throbbed and bled in my pockets all the way back home. With each jostle of the city bus the pain came, lessening each time. \n \n `` Bruce Wayne just got his ass BEAT DOWN!'' came a voice from somewhere aboard as I disembarked. I looked back to see a woman showing her friends blurry video of him being put aboard an ambulance. `` It's about time someone fucked up a rich dude. We all know they scammin'.'' A consensus of approval reverberated throughout the vehicle. The Badger had won the day.\n"}

It is hard to swallow. I lean on the sink and look out into the car park. There are no people. I think about going to the bus stop, but toss it aside. I'll borrow the bike. I stand outside Hannah's room. I can hear nothing. When I put my cup in the sink I wipe my face. \n \n \n \n Albert is empty. The intersection with Easter is a few houses down. I have my phone with me. Every sound is echoed, amplified. I see the first one at the stop. \n \n \n \n She is older, huddled in a pile of scarves. In her smooth hands are a pair of knitting needles. A sock is taking shape. It is small enough for a baby. I lay the bike on the ground. I want to touch her. \n \n \n \n As I reach out I think she might move. Her eyes have no pupil. They are flat. \n \n \n \n Once, when I was very young, I went on a trip to a museum. It might have been the V and A or the British Museum. It was the one with the gods who sat on a building in Greece. I had wanted to touch one then too. They all looked so calm, so knowing. I touched a woman's hand. As I reached out I was full of fear. She was graceful. I could see the shape of her through the carved silk. The feeling was unlike anything I'd known. When I gripped her fingers I felt safe. \n \n \n \n That was what this felt like. Cool and smooth. I could see the gray marbling along the ridge of her nose. I touched the swell of her cheek. Unlike the god her clothes were real. I did not move for a while. I looked at the flat eyes. Somehow, around her eyes and in the shape of her mouth I could feel an emotion. \n \n \n \n I pressed my hand against her face. \n \n \n `` I'm sorry.'' I whispered. I hoped she could n't... The thought was too horrible. \n \n \n I biked down the hill. I passed a billboard about the kelpies. Here and there the statues stood. They were not twisted or disfigured. I wondered when this had happened. A man has a key in the door of a chippie. I slowed. The sign said it opened at six. The momentum was enough to get me by the castle. It sat only a few yards away but the shadows it threw were giant. The sun was n't high but is was bright. If in closed my eyes I could imagine the warmth. \n \n \n As I sat there in to middle of the street my phone rang. A clock inside of a close said it was almost six. The sun shafted through the pines at the end of the road. \n \n \n `` Hello?'' I did n't recognise my voice. \n \n \n There was the soft sound of breathing, then `` Gen? Gen?'' I knew that voice. \n \n \n `` Hey Paddy.'' I swallowed. \n \n \n `` Hi.'' His voice was soft. `` Where are you?'' \n \n \n `` In front of the castle.'' \n \n \n `` Ah.'' I settled down on the seat.

Guess I forgot to tell you. I'm... I'm in Brighton.'' \n \n \n `` How is it?'' \n \n \n `` There's a ship on the beach. It crashed during the night. I went to see if anyone was hurt.'' His breath was shallow. \n \n \n `` I know what you saw.'' \n \n \n I watched a bird perch on a man bending to tie his shoe. It scratched at the the folds of his shirt. \n \n \n `` I can come to you, so you wo n't be alone.'' \n \n \n `` How would you do that?'' \n \n \n `` There's no train. I could bike.'' \n \n \n I could hear him sit down. The pebbles clattered as he moved. `` That's far.'' \n \n \n `` People do bike tours along the coast of Spain. Edinburgh to Brighton is n't impossible.'' \n \n \n `` How long will that take you?'' \n \n \n I had never done something like this before. Others had. It was n't impossible. It could n't be.

The night was wet, barely a drizzle at the moment, but the clouds hanging heavy overhead. She shivered and pulled her hoodie tighter. She checked the square of light on her phone. It was the right address, all right, Littleton High School. She tugged at the gate and it swung open, metal cleaving neatly apart. It had been locked, she knew that intuitively, it had been locked until she'd touched it. Angie glanced to the sky. The moon was hidden. Someone was still using magic around here. \n \n Only half the lights in the gym were on, dark things hiding in the rafters. They'd set up folding chairs in a circle, a table with two thermoses and a bunch of paper cups on it. It made them look tiny in the vast empty gym, tiny and pathetic and alone. A girl stood, bushy hair falling to her shoulders, a fresh crop of pimples breaking out all across her pale face. `` Angie?'' she said, and then smiled. `` Angie, is that you?'' \n \n `` Yeah,'' Angie said, and they all stood up then, feet shuffling, congregating around her. The pimply girl - Sandra, that had to be Sandra - walked right over and swept her up in a hug. Sandra was real tall up close, a head taller than her, and Angie squirmed awkwardly. \n \n `` It's so good you could come! Hi, I'm Sandra, by the way, and this is - wait, wait, let's all introduce ourselves...'' There was a bunch of stepping forward, stepping back, people rearranging themselves. `` Hold on, hold on, just find a seat, we'll get around to it...'' Sandra peeked behind Angie, looking to the door she had come from, looking for someone else. `` Where's...?'' \n \n `` I came alone,'' Angie said quickly, and plopped down on one of the chairs. She could feel everyone's eyes on her. She stared back, daring any of them to say something. Five others, two girls and three boys, all against her and an empty chair. \n \n `` Ah. Well.'' Sandra smiled nervously. `` That's fine, that's fine then. Jane did n't want to come either. So.'' She found her way back to her seat. `` Everyone say hi to Angie.'' \n \n `` Hi Angie,'' came the chorus. \n \n `` So, uh, this is our first time, I thought everyone would like to just introduce themselves first-'' \n \n `` Oh for god's sake,'' one of the boys spoke. He had his arms crossed tightly around him, legs tucked in, trying to take up as little space as possible. `` We all know each other, we've fucking talked online. What's this bullshit that you're trying to pull, Sandra, trying to be professional -'' \n \n `` Brian!'' Sandra hissed. \n \n `` Yeah, so I'm Brian,'' he went on, and jabbed his finger at the boy next to him. `` And that's our brother Andrew.'' Andrew was taller than Sandra, gangling, awkward. He swallowed and his Adam's apple bobbed. `` Um, hi,'' he said. \n \n `` So we're the famous Pembertons, minus one,'' Brian went on. `` Jane's not coming, Jane's fucked.'' \n \n `` Brian!'' Sandra repeated. `` We are trying to-'' \n \n `` Uh, Sandra, I think it's all right,'' the other girl said brightly. She was very blonde, very white teeth, wearing much too little for such a shitty night. `` We're all friends here. I'm Jennifer, yeah, obviously.'' She beamed at everyone and then touched the hand of the boy next to her. He was pudgy and bespectacled and grinned awkwardly at her touch. `` And this is Martin! It's so great to finally meet you all!'' \n \n `` Hey,'' Brian said, still curled up in himself. `` So does anyone here have any idea how we're supposed to be getting through this?'' \n \n Angie surprised herself with a laugh. It was creaky and rusty coming out of her throat. `` I ca n't believe I came here,'' she said. She put her head in her hand and wound her hair around her finger. It was still damp. `` The four of you together, you could n't even save your sister. But just bring in more weirdos, that'll fix things, right?'' \n \n `` That's not fair,'' Andrew said, not meeting her eyes. There was no energy in his voice, just a quiet acceptance. \n \n `` She's right,'' Brian said. `` She's right, let's face it, she's right!'' \n \n `` I do n't think-'' Jennifer started to say, and then looked around and looked at Martin, who looked back at her helplessly. `` I mean, I thought that this would be...'' She looked over at Sandra, waiting for a cue. `` I mean, this was organized and all.'' \n \n `` I...'' Sandra said, her face sallow. She wetted her lips. `` We brought coffee,'' she finally said, glancing over at the table. Her hair hung limply around her spotty face. `` We brought a thermos of coffee. It - it seemed like the thing to do.''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Humans are literally the smallest species in a universe of giants , but we compensate that problem with numbers .\n","story":"I love bots. Those little, head-sized, flying mechanical contraptions, capable of flying in alien nostrils and blowing them up. Just add a little Uranium-235 into their chassis, and everything it can reach will be blown to gibs. \n \n You see, everything in the universe is big. Well, except us. Fewili, for example, are 24 metres high. While they are mostly peaceful, there are some who tries to eradicate us, so I just blow them up. Oh, and their families. I blow them up too. I just like blowing everything up, okay? \n \n I live in a ship. While it is a mothership ( sort of ) for us, it is barely the size of one of the bigger aliens' fighters. As a result, not only is it a lot more nimble than an alien fighter, but it is small enough that we could see them before they even come near us to detect anything, and we have cloaking on the ship to boot. \n \n I like this ship. I have ten workshops ( most of them are more assembly-lines than workshops ) in here, and they keep making more and more of the things I need. If I need more materials, well, I just send out a normal, human-sized automated fighter to gather more resources. \n \n Oh, and before you ask, yes, our fighters are so small that they ca n't even be detected by their sensors, even without any kind of cloaking. \n \n -- - \n \n Now, there's this huuuuge galactic council. In it were huuuuge aliens, ranging from ten to one hundred times our height! Oh, and there are a bunch of humans, but they are n't really taken seriously. \n \n I have some alien friends. They are there to, well, make others think I am an outgoing creature. I pretend to be a completely sane human, who does not think of blowing up someone every single second. Did I tell you about blowing up things? I just love doing it. The thrill of taking on something so much bigger than you, one that might consider you to be a fly, and BOOM! They now have a gaping hole where their heart used to be. \n \n This galactic council, well, did I mention why they do n't really take humanity seriously? Well, we can be easily squashed, for one, and if we are n't, we blow them up ( mainly to prevent ourselves from being squashed ). They also have longer-ranged weapons than us, but no devices with any problem-solving logic. \n \n Yes, they do n't have bots. That means I could technically fly a bot all the way to the other end of the galaxy, and set it to kill a random alien. Just because I can. \n \n Do I feel bad about it? Nope. The only thing I could empathise with are my bots' desire to blow up the Xenos scum. \n \n -- - \n \n Did you ever wondered why the only pockets of humanity left are all in ships? Well, landing on a planet means subjugating yourself to being an easy target. They can just fog the entire planet, or pour cement on your house, or just do whatever they want. \n \n Did you also wonder why there are so many, perfectly habitable, but uninhabited planets? We sent so many bots on them that nothing big could survive there anymore. We also destroyed all their incoming ships, so they ca n't even reach the planet. \n \n So, yes, even though humanity technically do n't own a planet, there are a bunch of human star clusters, filled with motherships, protected by a sphere of drones so thick that not a single alien ship could pass through it without being obliterated. \n \n Do n't forget my capability to clone myself. \n \n -- - \n \n I mentioned alien friends, before, did n't I? Well, I was kinda curious about some of them ( the ones that are kind enough ), so I boarded a small fighter and landed on one of their children, while she was alone next to a stream of sorts. \n \n She was a Fewili. She was green, had six legs, two arms, and look like a spider with its forelegs replaced by arms. \n \n I landed on her back, and, well, got of of my spaceship, and walked on her. \n \n At first I was kinda wary, since she was big, but she was kinda nice. She had a nice face as well. Pretty, purple eyes, blue lines on her face, thick cloth for hair. \n \n She turned behind, and started talking to me. She told me her name was Kinaui, and she was always curious about the stars. \n \n I asked her if she wanted to go to space. \n \n Honestly, this conversation is boring, but it ended up with me bringing her to space. \n \n I rather talk about the way her entire body moved, and how I managed to keep on top. \n \n You see, a Fewili's back was made of some kind of hard chitin, with large hairs popping out every so and so. Those hairs are actually crucial to making sure nothing slips off. \n \n I specifically designed my fighter to be able to land on anything, no matter how big it is, or how much it moves. The inner fighter is separated from the outer fighter with a dampener, which prevents any kind of movement from affecting its insides. That means it could accelerate from 0km\/h to 1 light year per second, and you will not feel a thing. \n \n When twisting her torso 180 degrees to the right to look at me, she moved her abdomen 45 degrees to the left. She would also tilt it 30 degrees to the left, as well as moving some of her back legs to compensate. \n \n This is why I brought a grappling hook and a jet-pack. \n \n She would then proceed to touch me, while telling me that she has never touched a human before, and ask me if I was willing to let her hold me. \n \n Her hands were a lot like human hands, well, except they are green, and large. \n \n She then lay down on the ground, with the bottom of her abdomen facing up, and placed me on her underside. I have no idea why she did it. Maybe she wants a belly rub or something? \n \n Now, the ship does have a sensor to sense wether it is about to get crushed under her weight, and it can take off from any angle, on any ground. \n \n So it flew away, and landed on some stable ground, always checking if something is about to step on it. \n \n Now, after she placed me on her underside, the natural thing was to touch everything, after all. \n \n So I walked all over her, and touched everything, and... \n \n I rather not talk about it anymore. \n \n She was one weird girl. \n \n I brought her to my mothership in the end, though. \n \n She's still on my mothership. Or rather, one of my motherships. I think she likes being crammed in a ship too small for her. \n \n I really do not understand her. I do n't understand her biology, either, or how to turn her into a land-based ship. \n \n I'm sure she do n't mind if I did it to her. After all, she told me that she really like the idea of being turned into a ship. \n \n I really do n't understand her. \n \n -- - \n \n Talking about her, well, reminded me of something. I really need to insert more rooms into her, since the sooner I got her ready as a shell, the better. \n \n Nobody will expect drone-bombs launched from a Fewili's abdomen, after all. \n \n Boom.\n"}

My name is Officer Kevin Brown, and this here is detective Peter Stork. We'd like you to come with us down to the station.'' \n \n Sudden understanding sent cool panic shooting through my limbs. My fingers clenched automatically. \n'Did I forget to take the pill last night?' Horror controlled my hand as I slammed the door.

Pulling it closed over me, true dark shuttered my eyes. \n \n Allowing my eyes to adjust to the dark, I crept through my cellar. Meanwhile, as I slowly pushed the door open, I searched in my pockets. \n Pulling free my earbuds and cell phone, I disappeared into the vast forest surrounding my house. Time to see what drew the police to my door. \n \n Keeping one ear open, I pulled open my youtube app, ducking down within the thick roots of a denser cluster of trees. A great way to hide the light. I heard yelling back around in my yard, but the cellar was an addition I had built on my own, with a door that opened out in the dense heart of the forest. Good thing the sun had n't risen, the moon a pale glow that drenched the forest in the dullest of lights. \n I opened up the search bar, and put in my name. \n \n Well, fuck. \n \n Thousands of videos popped up. But the first was the one that caught my attention. \n \n `` Marcus Ryan, Dream 76849xt1p9, 09\/23\/2134.'' \n \n My stomach sank, the thumbnail was her face. \n \n My first, my sweet love. \n \n A dark desire opened up in me as I clicked on the video. \n \n Ah. So I *had* forgotten to take the pill that suppressed dreams. \n \n It was a dream of my memory. My memory of that night with my first. She was so sweet. \n \n Even now, through my earbuds, her screams sounded like music. As she cried, deep sobs in her chest, my knife cut wetly through her abdomen. The sound of that ripping flesh brought shivers down my spine. \n \n Abruptly, the dream switched, and there stood one of my *favorites*, number 147. She was the one that had that *excited* look on her face, as I lowered it down upon the burner, her flesh sizzling. \n \n I kept her alive for weeks. \n \n The dream switched to when I finally killed number 147, by making her devour number 148, as number 148 struggled. So hard. \n \n I sighed with a soft nostalgia, as another related video caught my eye. \n \n `` The Northwest Ripper found through Dream Storage technology!'' \n \n Found, maybe. \n \n But not caught. \n \n I took the battery and all of the cards from my phone and stored them in my backpack, winding up my earbuds around them. \n \n Nope, not caught. \n \n Not this time, not ever. \n \n It was time to find number 237.\n"}

A two story thatch structure was centered squarely on the back of the bronto and it too had cheerful yellow and green highlights. The bronto came to a slow and gentle halt right next to the platform. \n \n Mac gingerly stepped onto the back of the bronto, finding it surprisingly stable.

He will dine on the finest meal I ever make. \n \n It's tough getting by on $ 800 a week but the cost was worth it; almost $ 100 out-of-pocket to buy the ingredients from Rob's Grocery. I used to take Lexi there. She would ride in the cart and call it a submarine.

The tissue began to unravel itself as its upper corners began to bend down and try to wipe off the semen Jack had just issued into it. `` Filthy filthy filthy!'' the tissue exclaimed as it looked up at Jack.

Without anything to throw, he grabbed the coffee mug from his assistant \u2019 s hands and threw it to the ground. \u201c Let \u2019 s take five, \u201d he mumbled as he left the soundstage. \n \n \u201c Really, Jim. *Really*? \u201d Annabelle berated the actor. \u201c You say that *after* I ask what that was. You have ONE line! Henrik doesn \u2019 t even speak English, and he got his line right! \u201d \n \n \u201c Hmm? \u201d Henrik looked blankly in her direction after hearing his name. \n \n \u201c Nothing, \u201d Annabelle waved him off. \u201c Go back to sleep. \u201d Henrik shrugged and closed his eyes. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m sorry, \u201d Jim told her sincerely. \u201c I \u2019 ll get it right this time, I promise. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, you will, \u201d Nina, the anxious actress, told him as she sprinkled sand on his head. \n \n Jim pulled back quickly and rubbed the sand out of his hair. \u201c What the...? What are you doing?! \u201d \n \n \u201c The horseshoe crab is my spirit animal, \u201d she told him calmly as she wiped the excess sand from her palm. \u201c I \u2019 m asking it to guide you so I \u2019 m not here until 3 am again. \u201d \n \n \u201c Too late, \u201d Annabelle corrected her as she pointed to a clock on the wall. Nina looked over her shoulder to see, but the clock was obscured from her line of vision by a motionless black crow. Nina shivered. \n \n \u201c Are you cold? \u201d Jim asked, preparing to offer her his jacket. \n \n \u201c Uh, no, \u201d Nina replied disdainfully. \u201c It \u2019 s like 95\u02da in here. \u201d After a moment of reflection, she decided, \u201c It must be my inner horseshoe crab responding to the presence of a predator. \u201d \n \n As she said this, the crow turned its neck only and faced the group. \u201c SQUAWK! \u201d The sound of the bird startled Henrik from his repose. \u201c SQUAWK! \u201d The bird swooped above the actors, just missing Jim \u2019 s head as it landed in the Director \u2019 s chair. With a puff of black smoke, the crow was replaced by a tall, thin man with dark hair, a black beard, and a long pointed nose. His black eyes moved from actor to actor, and as he walked slowly towards them they instinctively huddled together. With each step, a heavy wooden staff struck the concrete floor and echoed throughout the building. \n \n \u201c Alright, let \u2019 s get this over with! \u201d the Director yelled as he returned. When he noticed the stranger, he added, \u201c Hey, get off my set! \u201d The Director abruptly disappeared into thin air.

He seemed to look through the actor as he answered, \u201c I \u2019 m what you might call a demon. I am the *Haught Barbatos* \u201d. \n \n Instead of quivering horror, Jim surprised the incubus by breathing a sigh of relief. \u201c So, I \u2019 ve been saying it wrong. \u201d \n \n Barbatos scratched his beard and seemed puzzled. \u201c What? No, I \u2019 m the Haught Barbatos. You know, the Duke of Hell, \u201d the demon gave him a sinister glare.

Two nomadic tribes isolated on each side of the planet begin to find the 500 year old relics of the other .\n","story":"We set out laden with a complete arsenal of tools. Ropes and hooks for climbing, blades for cutting through vegetation, axes for marking our path, and torches to light our way. You never know what sort of terrain God has created for the next migration. \n \n And that's what He does; creates the land ahead of us, cold from His concealing darkness, and takes the land behind us, consuming it with His eternal fires. If His people linger too long we will be burned, but go too far ahead and we will freeze. Thankfully, between the two is a twilight, perfect for his people to dwell in. \n \n However, that twilight realm is ever moving, shifting into the New Lands while the land that it once covered is consumed by fire. That's why we were sent out; to carve the path ahead for His people, and find land close to the front of the twilight realm for us to dwell on. \n \n The last migration took place when I was but a child, and now that I'm in my prime it is my turn to join the scouting parties. \n \n `` Tristan!'' I snapped out of my thoughts, and looked up to see what the others wanted. After a time even the task of exploring the unknown becomes routine and boring, and that time had passed for me a long time ago. `` We must have gone over several horizons by now. We should rest.'' Marcus continued. \n \n He was n't wrong; now that I was stopped, and the time that had passed been pointed out to me, I felt the sting of exhaustion in my limbs. Marcus has always been the voice of reason. I nodded, and we set up camp under the trees at the edge of a clearing on the side of the mountain we were skirting our way around. \n \n ***** \n \n I was the last to wake, and found the other three covered in furs and huddled over a fire as the broke their fast on some of our rations. That's another thing I had n't noticed; the temperature was already noticeably lower. Low enough that I found myself shivering. \n \n I pulled the fur coat from my pack and wrapped myself in it, only to be greeted by the intense smell of dust. That's one of the small troubles that plague the early times after each migration: as the land moves towards the fires of the Lord in the last times before a migration furs are cast aside, and quickly collect dust due to disuse. When the time for a migration comes, and the furs are once again needed, most are overwhelmed by the smell and reduced to fits of sneezing for a season or two afterwards. \n \n `` You've left some for me, I hope?'' I asked, as I joined them by the fire. \n \n `` Finally awake, eh, Tristan?'' Felix asked, and he threw me my ration of bread. Still fresh enough to not be hard, but old enough to make me wish I had something to go with it. \n \n Before I could reply Leontes cut in `` Once you've finished eating we should get moving again. You know our orders: return to report what we've found before the rest of the people have had eight sleeps.'' Always focused on duty and orders, that Leontes. \n \n `` It should n't be much farther now. Another horizon or two and we will likely need start needing the torches.'' Marcus added. A voice of reason, maybe, but also overly optimistic. \n \n I was too fresh from sleep to restrain myself from cutting down his hopes. `` If only it were as simple as walking there and back. Steep hills and dense forests. If this is any indicator of the land over the next few horizons, then it could take us quite some time to scout out a spot for everyone to settle on. It looks as if the Lord has decided to throw us a bit of a trial for the next migration cycle.'' He looked hurt at that, and Leontes looked offended at my remark about the Lord, but I was too tired to care. I took my final bite of bread and rose. `` Felix, I'll take over the lead until our next sleep. Put out the fire and gather your things.'' \n \n *** \n \n Several more horizons had passed us by, and the terrain was beginning to level out. Marcus was at the front of our group, cutting us a path through the undergrowth, while I was behind him directing our path. Behind me was Felix with a lit torch, as we had gone far enough that what little light was left was being blocked completely by the forest's canopy. Leontes was at the rear, marking our path on the trees. \n \n Suddenly the trees gave way to a clearing. It almost felt unnatural; trees whose age must have spanned several tens of generations, then suddenly naught but grass. \n \n `` See, Tristan, faith prevails. The Lord would n't form land without providing a place for his people!'' Damn Leontes and his piety. He was n't wrong, though. Although the tall grass made it hard to judge, the clearing seemed large enough for our entire Town twice over. \n \n I pulled out my axe and cut a chunk out of the last tree. `` Everyone spread out and cut through the grass so that we can see the entirety of this clearing. Judging from the lighting and temperature, this is close enough to the New Lands to live on for the next cycle, assuming it's as perfect as it looks. Felix, stick your torch into that cut in the tree. That way we can all see it's light and the way from which we came. Shout if you need help.'' \n \n We left our packs by the tree and, grabbing our blades, got to work clearing the clearing. Leontes followed the tree line around to the left, I followed it to the right, and Marcus and Felix went through the centre of the clearing. Although swinging three foot blade around sounds fun, it's just about the most dull work you could imagine. Grass. Grass. And more grass. \n \n It seemed like an age had passed, when suddenly I heard Felix shout. I was the last one to find my way to him. `` What's happened? Tell me you're not hurt?'' The concern was genuine, as Felix was the only one of the group I felt particularly close to. \n \n `` No. Look.'' He said, pointing ahead of the path he had cleared. There was a wall of stone, taller than a man, jutting up out of the ground. Again, I had the feeling that this was not natural. \n \n `` Marcus, get a torch.'' I ordered, and he obeyed. \n \n When he returned we lit the torch and inspected the obstruction. It was made of many large, rough cut stones, and formed what almost seemed to be two walls of a house. Similar stones were scattered along the ground where the other two walls would have been. Between the walls of stone I found what appeared to be shards of hardened clay. Definitely not natural. \n \n `` There's more like it over here!'' Leontes yelled from the grass ahead. \n \n `` What do you think it is?'' Felix asked. \n \n `` No idea'' Said Marcus. \n \n `` It looks like it's been made by men.'' I suggested. \n \n Leontes wasted no time in pointing out my heresy. `` Impossible! These are the New Lands! No men have been here before us, this is fresh off of God's cold anvil.'' \n \n `` Then how else would you explain it? When has the Lord ever created anything like this before?'' \n \n `` Are you questioning his will? His power to create what has never been seen before?'' \n \n `` No! But ju-'' \n \n `` Stop it!'' Marcus cut across us both. `` We've never found anything like this before, it's true. But we were n't sent here to question the mysteries of God. We were sent to find land for our people to settle. Our elderly. Our women. Our children. We have done that. Let's turn back, and let the Council decide what to make of this.'' \n \n `` Agreed. Stop acting like idiots.'' Felix added. \n \n `` True.'' Leontes conceded. \n \n `` Let's rest first, then head back upon waking'' I said. We retrieved our packs, and set up our camp between those stone walls. \n \n *** \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Vampires not only exist , but there 's a wide variety sub-breeds . Explore the differences between two or more conflicting vampires\n","story":"Nothing can compare to the deep seated racism of an immortal. When life is never changing, it becomes easy to create barriers and have them stick. There are the original vampires which hail from Dracula's bite, dhampirs that result of an original vampire and a human woman, those who are cursed into vampirism, and those who have such diluted blood from generations of turning. I fall into the last group. The lowest of the low. Normally I can go about my nightly life without too much hassle, but it is time for The Gathering, and just as the name suggests, we are all called to our rulers court. \n \n There are only a few originals left. After Dracula sold his soul to become the first vampire he turned the commanders of his army. His original intention was to have the entire army turned, but he found his energy was completely depleted after the first few. He then issued an order that no one should be turned without his permission. The men found a way around this in their relationships. After several years the vampires started to gather half blood children. The kids had extraordinary strength, abilities with animals of the night, and the magic to glamour a regular human, but they lacked the ability to create others like themselves. \n \n No matter how loyal one may be, stringent rules are hard to follow, especially for those who are already cursed. Dracula would turn one or two more vampires each year, but the others began experimenting with the skill. They noticed that their bloodlines had less magical skill, but at the time it was n't too concerning. It was n't until those children were creating their own vampires and those turning humans too, that the level of undervampires was created. \n \n In the early days, Dracula tried to ensure that all vampires were relocated to his estate. When stories of strange murders or missing people would reach his ears, he would bring an emissary to find the new creature. Most of the time they would know who had turned them into a vampire, but a rare few came without the tell tale bite scar and no knowledge of a master. These vampires had an array of abilities, some that Dracula himself did n't even master, so they were closely watched and highly regarded. \n \n After centuries of vampires being made in various means, Dracula set up a tiered court. The originals reported directly to the emperor and were beyond reproach, the magic turned vampires, or as we call them the Cursed, elected an official, Grigori Rasputin. The biological sons and daughters of vampires were governed by Dracula's own son, Mircea, however they were often controlled more by their parents than anyone else. I believe that the hardest court to manage was that of the undervampires. Our sheer numbers make it difficult, but our apathy is the real problem. Why report to a mystical governor when one blood bag a week keeps you living like a regular human with an odd work schedule? Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, the Bloody Countess, gave us a reason. Either we participate like all the others, or she will spill your lifeblood into her Roman bathtub. She claims it's great for our undead skin! \n \n At the gathering, the Countess is the only one of us allowed in the meetings with Dracula sitting at the head table with Rasputin and Mircea. His original vampires and the Cursed sit in the gallery. While the two factions do n't completely agree, they are smart enough that a clashing between their magnificent powers would be a detriment to all. The dhampirs can choose to join their fathers, however like most children of the wealthy and powerful, they tend to spend this time frivolously showing off, drinking expensive blood tinged wine, and having copious amounts of sex. \n \n My people are another story. We do not get to join the meetings as equals and are only invited to act as all manner of servants. We bring the fresh flesh to the doors of the great hall, ensure that the others have all that they need to maintain the extravagant lifestyle they are used to, and attend to the desires of the proper vampires. To refuse, is to consent to death, so for centuries we have been mo more than slaves. \n \n I have been a vampire for one hundred seventy three years, and this will be my third Gathering. At my first, I was used for my humanity. I was able to convince the townspeople to attend a ball at a secluded castle like a used car salesman works a deal with a lemon. The next Gathering I was deemed too antiquated to understand the human condition and set to serve the Cursed in their bedrooms. It was there where I learned that while the only vampiric quality I possess is everlasting life in exchange for a bit of blood drinking, it is also my greatest strength. My barely enhanced human life apparently sill gives me the unique ability to carry a child. I left the last Gathering with my son growing in my womb, and now fifty years later, I have a man who is more powerful than I could imagine. He possesses the abilities of the Cursed I was assigned to, mind control and the ability to transform into mythological creatures, but he also has my ability to blend with the human population and survive in minimal blood. This time I will not be the plaything of those currently in power. This time I'm going to break the system and bring the undervampires to the forefront.\n"}

Earth received millions of conversation requests during the first few days after the big unveiling, forcing NASA to create a Conversation with Earth Committee to control the use of MIT \u2019 s geo-broadcasters. At the same time, toy, stationery and movie industries saw this as the perfect opportunity to capitalize and milk money out of children.

He likes to think he \u2019 s more sensitive to things than others may assume. \n \n \u201c Hello? Is that Mars? \u201d, the ringing said. \n \n \u201c Freakin \u2019 finally! \u201d, Mars words echoed across the radio transmission. \n \n A short astronomical while after, the friendly folks at MIT could then be seen swimming in even larger sums of cash. \n \n *** \n \/\/This is my second WP story and I really enjoyed writing this: D\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The normal sleeping pattern for everyone on Earth is to sleep for 23 hours and be awake for one hour . Except for one little girl .\n","story":"It was another beautiful day for her, with the moon shining high above her head, the stars twinkling back upon her misty reflection. There was nothing irregular about it. \n She bounded from roof to roof, across alleys and past windows, in the sprawling urban shanty town where she played her game, with her bag over her back. It had barely been 10 minutes before she spotted what she was looking for; an open window. \n In a few youthful leaps that was typical of her childish body, she had arrived on the windowsil, and she pried open the window and slipped inside. She had been here before, and she recognised the bodies in front of her. \n It was an old couple. They had left some bread on the windowsil, for the birds, and she ate it, as she did every day. Then she stopped awhile, to talk to her friends. \n She told her about what she'd been up to since they last met, how she was feeling, and she asked about them, although they never replied. She upheld her part of the conversation, and just like every other person she knew, they always ignored her. She was doing everything right, she thought; she followed the dialogue exactly as she'd seen it in those films. But as always, there was the awkward silence. She did n't mind; she thrived on these silences. \n She looked at the couple; examined their faces, their features. These people had darker skin than her, everybody did; she had concluded a while ago that she had very pale skin, especially compared to the people in the films. But they lived in a different world, a brighter world. They were aliens to her. Everybody was. \n \n She stared upon these aliens, who had never spoken to her, but she had told everything. She memorized their faces, their breathing patterns, and tried to imagine them talking, smiling, anything. But always, the same blank faces. They look so peaceful, so unmoving, just like the stars that she knew as well as the strangers in front of her that she was so well acquainted with. When she had the scene in front of her engraved in her mind, she took out a sheet of paper and a pen out of her bag, and she drew them. \n Her strokes so delicate they carressed the paper, hardly tempting the pen to release its ink, but the gentle persuasion of her fingertips teased the black liquid of immortality onto the canvas. She willed the drawing into existence, and it became. When it was, she put the paper and the pen back into her bag, and, softly kissing her friends farewell, she slipped quietly out, as if she were the soft whisper of a sleeping child, so quiet and tender that one is never sure of its existence at all. \n \n She bounded from roof to roof, across alleys and past windows, in the sprawling urban shanty town where she played her game. It was another beautiful day for her, with the moon shining high above her head, the stars twinkling back upon her misty reflection. The only irregular thing about it was her. \n \n Or, that was the only irregular thing about the day to him. He laid his eyes upon her, drinking in her movement; it was nothing he'd ever seen before. The way she so easily sprang about, almost effortlessly; the others have a hard time turning their head, whilst here he was, his whole world turned upside down by this creature before him. He felt a sharp pang of jealousy for the stars, who had been watching her all these times, had been able to lap in her beauty for so much longer than he. He wanted her. So he followed her. \n \n He was sure to keep his distance. She had n't seen him yet, and he did n't want to alarm her. He was trying to conceive a method of presenting himself to her without scaring her; he was probably so different to her as well. He watched her slip into an open window, as he had done so many times himself. He sat there, across the street, shrouded in the darkness of the day, waiting for her radiance to emerge and bestow itself upon him once more, and it did. It pleased him to watch her, gracefully pirouetting between the steel walls with which he had shared his loneliness for so long, and with which he now shared his newfound companionship. He watched her as she entered another window, and he resolved to himself that he would wait in plain sight so that she should see him when she left the room. \n \n Time passed. His friends in the sky smiled goodnight at him one by one and sank further downwards and faded from his sight. The moon dipped behind a building, as if it felt upset that his friend had left him for another. Time passed. She did n't come out. \n He eventually decided to go in himself. \n \n Slipping through the window, he looked for the girl, and he saw her; how much more beautiful she was up close, how much more radiant! The brightest light he had ever seen. And he loathed her for teasing him. And he loathed her for betraying him to the loneliness he knew before. And he loathed her for giving him such hope that would never be fulfilled. For she was as the others; lying, asleep, motionless. \n He looked around the room; he had never been in this one before. There was paper hung on every inch of every wall, and he recognised the people reflected on the dull mirrors. He had watched every one, hated them for being but not doing. When he had looked at all the art, and admired each one, he sat down, and he looked at the girl, as he had looked at everyone else before, but with more love, and more hate. He watched her gently rise and fall as she breathed. He grew ecstatic when she let out a sigh. His lucidity peaked when she stirred. But he was not satisfied; he obtained this from everyone else. He wanted more; but he could see that there was no way of obtaining his only and greatest desire. So he settled to give her a gift that nobody else could give to her; not the stars, not the moon, not the sleeping strangers, not even herself. \n \n He picked up a piece of paper and a pen, and created the final and most perfect work of art for her collection.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You routinely break into people 's houses , but you never steal or destroy anything . So what the heck do you do in there ?\n","story":"Sorry, this does n't follow the prompt that well but when i started i could n't stop. \n \n Today was long, work was hard, and the worst part of it was, I was dreading the my return home. It had been four weeks since Jessica had died. My best friend, my wife, and the mother to my child, taken by the cancer in her breast. After picking up my 14 year old, Alex, from school, I wondered how she was affected by all of this. \n As I look back to see her, I could only be reminded of Jessica. Jessica, whose dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and gorgeous smile that made my heart skip a beat when I saw her, had passed her beauty on to Alex. But Alex was n't smiling `` Hey, Alex?'' I called from the front seat `` How was school?'' \n \n `` It was fine dad.'' she said while staring into her smartphone. \n \n `` Alex, if you want to talk..'' \n \n `` I do n't want to talk dad.'' She interrupted \n \n She did n't want to talk, but that's what all teenagers are like... Right? It did n't matter anyway, after driving for 30 minutes in the rain we were almost home. \n The rest of the night went on as any other night had, Alex went up to her room to study and do teenager things, I attempted to make a decent meal, and after eating a terrible meal, we both went to our bedrooms. But tonight was different. After four weeks I had n't truly accepted Jessica's death, whereas Alex seemed to have gotten over it already. Tonight, for the first time since her death, I realized, Jessica was n't coming back. I would never hear her sweet voice again, I would never hear her play Claire De Lune on the piano again, never would I smell the fantastic new dish she was cooking, and worst of all, she would never sarcastically insult me again. At 11 PM at night, I drove through the rain to the cemetery she was buried at, coming to her grave. For the first time since the funeral, I cried. Drenched in the rain, soaked in tears, on my knees in the mud, I cried. \n \n After two hours, I got up and drove back home. I walked back into my room and, without a second thought, grabbed my pistol from where it was hidden in my nightstand and placed it on the bed while I went to the bathroom to get the bullets. After returning I put a bullet into the clip then slid it slowly into the gun. \n \n `` Dad?'' \n \n I quickly turn around swiftly placing the gun underneath a nearby pillow to see Alex in her pajamas behind me. \n \n `` Alex!'' I said quickly `` Why are n't you asleep, it's 1:30 in the morning?'' \n \n `` I could n't sleep.'' she said, looking down `` Could I sleep in your bed tonight?'' \n \n I held my tears back as I looked at her `` Sure honey, give me a second to change and I'll be right back out.'' \n \n I came back out afterwords to find Alex completely asleep, so i quietly got in bed, making sure to keep my distance from her, as she often tends to kick me. \n \n *Beep* *Beep* *Beep* \n \n It's 7:30 AM, and I realize how late both me and Alex are going to be. Quickly I wake her up and we both get dressed. Groggy and hungry, I grab two packs of Pop Tarts, and get in the car. \n \n `` Hurry up Alex! We're gon na be Late!'' I yell from the window of the car. \n \n `` I have n't eaten yet!!!'' she yells angrily \n \n `` I've got some pop tarts, now hurry up and get in!'' \n \n After dropping off Alex, and arriving at work, I return back to the normal routine. For the rest of the day I forget entirely about what had happened the previous night and focus on doing my job. At 5:00 I leave and drive home all the while becoming more and more depressed with my current life. Every second more is another second I consider suicide. The debt caused by Jessica's treatment as well as the funeral has put me into severe debt, and, even after much negotiating, i could not get a pay raise nor any leniency on the loans i took out. I picked up Alex and we drove home in silence. Everything was normal until we got home. The door was wide open. I was petrified. \n \n `` Alex, did you lock the door this morning when we left?'' \n \n `` Yeah, why?'' \n \n `` Stay in the car Alex.'' I said with a stern tone \n \n `` What's going on dad?'' \n \n `` Call 911 Alex, someones broken into the house.'' \n \n I quickly approached the door, fearful for my life, my daughters, and the state of my house. But as I walk inside, I notice one thing that is almost definitely out of place, the house is clean. For four weeks neither me nor Alex had cleaned the house in any way shape or form, but the house was completely clean. And even more surprising was that nothing was missing. After searching the entire house I let Alex get out of the car. After the police arrived and I made a statement, i returned to the house and decided to make some food for dinner, but thats when I noticed it, a note, written in Jessica's handwriting. The note was titled *The best spaghetti sauce you have ever tasted*, and a recipe for spaghetti sauce followed it. I picked it up and looked at it for ten minutes, and, after much consideration decided it was Jessica's handwriting. Perplexed, I stood there wondering how it got there, but as i was doing so Alex came up to me. \n \n `` Dad, whats for dinner?'' \n \n `` Sorry honey'' i say `` I do n't...'' \n \n `` Whats this!'' she says as she grabs the note from my hand `` Ooh, spaghetti sounds good! Where did you get this recipe?'' \n \n `` Uhhh, I... found it.'' I say stupidly \n \n `` Well, can you make it?'' \n \n `` I guess.'' \n \n So I make the spaghetti sauce while Alex cooks the spaghetti. After finishing we both coat the spaghetti with sauce and proceed to eat it while watching TV. \n \n `` This is great dad!'' says Alex \n \n `` Thanks, do you know who wrote this recipe?'' \n \n `` No but it sure tastes like what mom used to make.'' \n \n She was right which confused the whole break in thing even more. After cleaning up the dishes, I return to my room. What happened while I was gone? Why was the door open? Why was the house clean? And who wrote that recipe? I laid down to contemplate this, when my head hit something hard. *The gun*. I pulled it out from under the pillow. After such a long day I remembered that it was there. After thinking about Alex I put the gun back into my night stand and proceeded to go to sleep. The next day I wake up happy for the first time in a month. I rush downstairs to make Alex breakfast and then we both leave, but first I make sure to lock the door. \n \n Two months later, after settling some of the debt I felt much better about life going forward, Alex was doing well in school and everything was going alright. Except it was n't. Even though it had been three months, i could n't help but keep thinking of Jessica. Not a day would go by where she was n't in my mind. After picking up Alex, we returned home, where we would contemplate either Pizza, Spaghetti, or going out to eat. But the door is open again. \n \n `` Stay in the car Alex'' I say quietly \n \n `` Dad I want to come with you.'' \n \n `` Fine but be quiet.'' I whisper \n \n But something is different this time. \n \n Music, someone is playing the piano. \n \n It's Debussy! Someone is playing [ Clair de Lune ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=LlvUepMa31o ) on the piano. As I approach the piano room the music gets louder. I enter the room with Alex behind me. I see someone playing the piano. But just as the music builds, they stop. I see the burglar running, all I manage to see is the burglars dirty blonde hair. Before i can come to my senses the burglar is gone. \n After calling the police again we make it very clear that nothing was stolen, Alex and I go to bed. As I lay down, i think about Jessica. The burglar looked similar, but I did n't get a good enough look. But before I go to sleep I make sure to lock the door. \n \n Five years later \n \n Alex has gone off to college and I am left alone. Alex tried to get me to start dating again, but it has n't worked out. I guess there was no one else in the world like Jessica. But for now I am alone. I decided to call in sick to work today and slept well into the afternoon. But i woke up to an abrupt noise. I walk out into the living room to see that the tv was on. Friends was playing, Jessica's favorite tv show. I must have left it on but thats when I saw her, a woman dressed entirely in black, wearing a mask over her face, all I could see was her eyes, her blue eyes. She quickly ran off, much faster than I could move. \n \n `` Jessica!'' I yelled \n \n Cont: In Comments \n \n *Edit: Words\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Reddit karma works exactly like mana in real life , the more you have of it allows increasingly greater spells and abilities you can wield . But nobody considered what the greatest negative karma holders might be able to do ...\n","story":"Part 1 \n \n Amazing to think that it all started in a community of electronic signals sent through cables about 26,000 years ago. To think that a \u201c website \u201d would change to course of human evolution seems absurd, but we \u2019 re living proof. Back then karma was nothing more than a vote you got for saying something that the Reddit community liked or at least thought was valuable. Reddit is not just a website anymore and karma isn \u2019 t just a silly statistic. \n \n Reddit \u2019 s influence became more and more relevant over time. News and media was delivered to the users of Reddit by visiting their website. Users could target the news and media they preferred by subscribing to subreddits and viewing their content. This became a very powerful form of news delivery. So powerful, that in the year 2,165 Reddit had taken over all media outlets and had been one the first publically approved monopolies of its time. It didn \u2019 t stop there. \n \n The Reddit Science community was very focused on contacting alien life. So determined, in fact, that when they made contact with an alien race in 2,246 it came as no surprise to the general population. The race was a species of small, humanoid creatures that name was impossible for humans to pronounce so we fittingly deemed them the \u201c Snoo \u201d race. The Snoo were much more advanced than us, but invited us to join their galactic alliance in exchange for some of our renewable resources. We graciously accepted the offer and we joined the alliance not as Earth, but Reddit. \n \n The Snoo aided the human race over the next 15,000 years, until they considered us their equals, and helped us in modifying our own DNA; speeding up the evolution process. Reddit ( formerly Earth ) has natural energy source that has always been there, but was misunderstood and untapped prior to our evolution. Our evolution triggered a response to utilize that energy source which we call karma. Karma can be passed from one person to the next very similarly to the way karma points were exchanged on the Reddit website. This metaphysical discovery has shaped the world of Reddit into the world we live in today.\n"}

I am astounded. I am thrilled with the prospect of true discovery, discovery the likes of which we have not had in over two centuries, not since the Age of Discovery was birthed, in pain and blood, hope and greed. \n \n I walk amongst them. \n \n I touch nothing. This is a careful, careful recon. I am protected, but we wanted to go in with just people. We did n't know if our machines might wake their machines and if they were still alive after all this time, then theirs would trump ours and we might end up dead. \n \n Even when the Natives in the Age of Discovery found and nursed back to health those European explorers, it often ended badly. We had no wish to end nearly so badly. We wanted to approach this very, very carefully. \n \n The world was united in this. We were preparing. The for best and the worst. However, we needed to know if they were rising now. And only way was to go and see. \n \n So... \n \n I walk amongst them. \n \n Some of the chambers are broken and cracked, their contents long dead. Some are not. Some lack power and I can see the entities that had been within had attempted to escape, but had not. It was... disturbing. Some still had power and seeming to be intact. \n \n I peered closely, my diamond hard visor protecting me. No creature was going to leap through and attack my face. At least not if human technology could prevent it. Someone had watched a few movies at least. \n \n Those inside were definitely not going to win any beauty prizes. That was for sure. I could not be completely certain of the details though. Perhaps that was for the best. \n \n I walk amongst them. \n \n My suit was armored and could have easily warded off a T rex's attack in its strength. Yet it was completely unpowered: the moon's lack of gravity worked in our favor. It was unpowered for the same reason as we were not sending in robots: we hoped it would not set off any sensors. \n \n I reached the end of the corridor where the alien cryopods were housed. There was a door. I did not touch it. I only looked. I would be turning around momentarily and heading back out. I was to map everywhere I could without opening or touching a thing. Then we would take the next steps by sending out people with shielded electronics. \n \n Slowly, carefully, mindful of every step, every move, I turned around. I walked back up the hall to the breach from the surface. When we had breached the hall, we were fortunate. Whatever atmosphere had been here was long gone. There was no blow out. No contamination of biologicals. At least we had that mercy. \n \n I made it below the breach and signaled I was going the other direction. They nodded. There was no way to signal otherwise. \n \n I walked away from them. \n \n I made it to what appeared to be a junction. Two doors were closed and I would not open them. It was dark, very dark in here. I used the chem lights. Light was very possible without electricity. Just as my camera was an old style film camera with no flash. The chem lights and the lighting from some of the machinery would have to do. \n \n I walked away from them. \n \n I made it down the hall. There was a lot of machinery. I documented and mapped what I could. I watched my every motion. I weighted every action. I was not hasty. \n \n I walked away from them. \n \n At the end of the hall was a solitary cryopod. It had been opened at some time in the past. Not recently. I marveled at it and documented it. \n \n However, I was became rather disturbed and I knew I could make a mistake. Under protocol, I was to return. I heartily agreed with that plan. It was time to go. I slowly rose from where I knelt to take photos of the cryopod and turned back the way I came. \n \n To walk what had been a total of 300 meters had taken more than two hours. I'd had enough of this creepy, exciting, dark and alien place. I stood erect and wobbled for a second. I steadied myself. I breathed deeply and slowly to keep from getting too excited. \n \n I opened my eyes, calm once more and took a step. \n \n Then the lights came on. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're out on a walk one night . A guy appears near you , hands you a book runs off . You look at it and the title is your name .\n","story":"`` What a terrible night.'' I thought as I walked through the rain soaked streets with thunder echoing in the distance. I had just broken up with my girlfriend and left her to get a cab home. We were together for 8 months and I really thought that she was going to be the one. The person I could spend the rest of my life with. Oh well, I guess when I found her sexting another guy I realized that this was going to end. I really was n't super surprised. I should have seen it coming. \n \n I turn the corner on to the street my apartment is on. Lightning strikes nearby and I quicken my pace. Despite the lack of an enjoyable evening I do live a rather good life. I am an accountant for the 4th largest accounting firm in New York and I have a nice apartment with quite a few friends in the area despite only living here for just over a year. All in all I should n't be complaining. I really do enjoy my work. \n \n Lightning flashes and a man appears next to me. I stumbled backwards trying to compose myself. `` David Atkins?'' the mysterious man asks. `` How do you know my name?'' I reply. `` My apologies.'' he says and hands me a book. I thought he was referring to startling me earlier. I look down and at the book. `` What is...'' I look up to see the empty sidewalk in front of me as the rain starts to pick up. I am momentarily distracted by the increasing downpour and put the book in my bag as I hurry the rest of the way into my apartment. \n \n I finally get a chance to take off my wet coat. The thing felt like it was twenty pounds and I have to say, it sure felt good to take it off. I place my bag on the counter and go to get a change of clothes. I decided it was a sweat pants and wine kind of evening. I went and uncorked my favorite brand of Zinfandel and went to retrieve my laptop. As I reached for my bag I remembered the book the stranger gave me. I pull it out of the bag and turn it over revealing the title. \n \n *David Atkins* \n \n Momentarily taken back by the title I inspect the book to see if I can find an author. Its a heavy book with lots of pages. It had intricate drawings on the cover and what appeared to be latin words. I look at the side of the pages and some seem older than the others. Curious. I felt like this was some sort of a joke. I cautiously opened to the first page. \n \n *David Atkins \n The man who knew numbers and life but not love. * \n \n Well, that was ominous. I turned to the first chapter and began to read. It detailed everything, where I was born, when I was born, the color of my first blanket, the home I grew up in out in Iowa, my sister's birth and my jealousy towards my parents for spending so much time with her. I quickly began to realize that this was no ordinary book. I must have been looking at a book written by one of my parents. They must have wanted to reach out to me. \n \n I had n't spoken to my parents since I moved to New York. It was fairly simple, I wanted to go and they did n't want me to. We fought about it and I moved out. I had n't spoken to my dad and the only thing I've heard from my mother was an occasional email detailing some things going on in their lives and asking about mine. I have n't responded yet. I keep meaning to but I never find the time. \n \n I shoot off a quick text to my sister, `` You do n't happen to know if mom or dad was writing books about our lives do you?'' `` I have n't seen anything... Why do you ask?'' `` I was given a book with my name as the title. Has a lot of detail about my life in it.'' She took a second but replied, `` That's pretty weird. Anything really strange in it?'' \n \n I left the question hanging for the moment. I really did n't know what to say. That it had crazy details that I did n't remember in them? Or things that most people other than myself would know? I started to flip to the middle. I read about middle school and Tommy who bullied me. I read about my first kiss in High School with Debbie. My fear of speaking in class and how I peed a little when I was laughing during a sleep over with friends. \n \n This ca n't be real. How could anyone have known all of this. Completely drawn in at this point I read about my fight with my parents, packing up my stuff, my first day of work and living out of my car for a couple days, finding my apartment now, meeting my, now, ex-girlfriend. Page after page of details. Tiny stuff, the color of my chair at work. What types of doughnuts I usually ate from the break room. How I chewed on my pencil when I could n't find a particularly stubborn purchase in a client's books. My parents could n't have written this. \n \n I realized now that I left my wine opened on the counter but at this point I could n't put down the book. I kept reading. I see the dates I went on and how I loved to fold paper flowers with messages inside. The time we went to the zoo and we ate ice cream while watching the polar bears. Then I found the section where I found the messages on her phone. The fight we had. How she apologized and begged me to forgive her. How I left her at the restaurant and told her we were done. Pages of detail of my emotions in the moment. \n \n Wait. This just happened tonight! How could that be in here? This is n't possible. \n \n I continue. I read about the rain that I walked back home in with the storm brewing. It said I turned the corner towards my building and the man appearing next to me. The open bottle of Zinfandel. Reading the book in my chair. \n \n Then it stops. There was no more writing in the book. No more details. How could this be? I ca n't seem to understand what could be happening. How could this book be telling me things that happened after it was given to me? \n \n My mind raced but one fact quickly cut through the noise in my head and hit me like a sledgehammer. After all of this detail and all of this knowledge about my life, there are only 4 empty pages left in the book.\n"}

Six in the morning should be okay. No one would be up at that time and be looking for a conversation.

Swallowing the thought, lest the words come out unintended, my thoughts coalesced into a polite answer. \u201c Yes. \u201d \n \n Her nodding once more blurred the line between sarcasm and sincerity. \u201c Come here often? \u201d \n \n Some deep, vocal part of me built a compelling case for turning around and walking off. Unfortunately, the British part commanded an inexhaustible patience for awkward small talk. \u201c No. \u201d \n \n More concerned nodding, accompanied by a concerned look. If only that concern could have been directed inwards, rather than towards me. \u201c Not a regular, huh? Well, an unfamiliar face is n't surprising in this big world of ours. \u201d \n \n Not wanting to imbalance the polite nodding, replied with my own. \n \n After a chuckle\u2014unclear at what\u2014her senses returned. \u201c Best be getting on with things, right? Have a good day. \u201d \n \n Though reluctant, my manners returned the sentiment. \u201c Have a good day. \u201d \n \n No matter how easy something should be in principle, there never was any hope of getting away from people.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A native sees a colonist for the first time .\n","story":"As I raised the fish to my mouth to take a bite from its still-flapping body, I saw the first one. Taking advantage of my shocked stillness, the fish wiggled free from my fist and plopped back into the water. \n \n It didn \u2019 t look much different than we do, that figure that stood on the other side of the water hole. Bipedal, two arms and legs, two eyes. Everything was basically the same, but there was a subtle difference that made the creature before me send shivers down my spine. It stood around nominal height, but its arms and legs were slightly too long, its chest too much broader than the rest of the torso. The proportions of the thing were too off. It \u2019 s eyes were just too far apart and just too sunken back in its too-large head. It \u2019 s ridgeless, too-large-nostrilled nose rest above a mouth that stretched too long across its jaw. Looking at the creature, frozen in my crouch at the water hole, the only word that came in my mind was \u201c too \u201d. \n \n The thing looked around itself, holding an odd, long device in its hands. It was, no doubt, a weapon. As the creature observed its surroundings, its eyes fell upon me and stopped. For a long while we just stared at each other, it \u2019 s too-round-eyed stare holding me in my spot. \n \n Knowing one of us had to break this terrible silence, I slowly stood to my full height and held my arms out to the side, showing this thing that I was unarmed. It seemed to understand my gesture, as it lowered the weapon it held and began to move towards me. \n \n \u201c Who are you? \u201d I asked as it approached, my voice seeming to be detached from myself. \n \n The creature lifted its wrist and brought it to its mouth. It began to speak in a harsh, odd tongue into the bracelet it wore upon the hand. In response, another voice issued from the manacle in the same language. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m not afraid of you, \u201d I said, unsure if I were trying assure the creature or myself. \u201c Mostly curious. \u201d \n \n The creature pointed at me and said something that ended on a raised inflection. A question. \n \n \u201c I do not understand, \u201d I responded, shaking my head. \u201c Do you understand me? \u201d The confused look on the thing \u2019 s face told me it did not. \n \n It pointed to itself and issued a word that sounded something like \u201c Cape-den-purse \u201d. \n \n \u201c Is that your name? \u201d I asked, pointing at it. \u201c Cape-den-purse? \u201d \n \n With satisfaction, the creature nodded vehemently and then pointed at me, putting on a face of exaggerated confusion. \n \n Understanding what it was asking, I pointed to myself and said, \u201c Forrest. \u201d \n \n \u201c Forrest? \u201d the thing asked, making sure it had gotten what I was trying to say, and I nodded. \n \n \u201c You come from space? \u201d I asked, performing gestures as I asked: pointing, making a walking motion with my fingers, and finally pointing to the sky. \n \n The creature nodded again. It pointed to the ground and then spread its hands out, as though flattening a piece of paper. \n \n \u201c You came to\u2026. \u201d I didn \u2019 t really understand the last part of its message, but decided it wasn \u2019 t particularly important. \u201c Are you hungry? \u201d I asked it, pointing towards my open mouth and then to my stomach. \n \n Then, from behind the creature, from the over the hill I saw another begin to come to the clearing. It carried a much larger weapon in its hands. When it saw me it began to shout in that harsh language of theirs and pointed its device at me. As it did so, more and more of the creatures began to come over the hill. Some came on foot and others in strange, wheeled creations. \n \n The first creature, the one I thought of as Too, conversed with the second, who had arrived at Too \u2019 s side, for a moment and then turned to me. In its eyes was a sad look as it raised its weapon towards me. \n \n I shook my head furiously, waving my hands at the creature, begging it not to use the weapon on me, but it was to no avail. A flash and explosion came from the end of the creature \u2019 s weapon, and I felt something penetrate my neck. \n \n As I fell to the ground in pain, the first and second creature began to move towards me. My vision was blurry and I felt extremely tired as they began to manhandle my body, picking me up and carrying me towards the rest of the arriving creatures. \n \n \u201c Taak eet toe thee larb, \u201d the second creature croaked as it and Too handed me off to another of the things, and as I began to drift into unconsciousness, I made out an emblem on Too \u2019 s clothing that bore strange markings that looked like this: \n \n U N I T E D S T A T E S O F A M E R I C A: C O L O N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A violinist discovers that their music can grant magical boons to those who stay awhile and listen . Luck , success , and even love come to those who hear a song fully through .\n","story":"The stage was set, and the audience sat with bated breath. For a room full of so many people it was quiet and still. Everyone was there for a reason, and they all knew what they were waiting for. \n \n From the left side of the stage came the sound of rolling wheels, and everyone sat up a little straighter in their plush seats. Whispers began to ripple through the attendees, the hushed excitement of people who were n't certain, even now, that this particular dream could really be coming true. \n \n And then, he emerged. \n \n Thunderous applause broke out from every corner, but it was accompanied by more whispers and even a few gasps. The man on the stage was not the famed violinist the world adored, but a hollowed out husk of a man. \n \n Seated, or rather reclined, in a wheeled hospital bed, Giancarlo Rufo was almost unrecognizable. The cancer had eaten away at his body, and the man who had once been famed as much for his easygoing charm and disarming handsomeness as his music was now emaciated and sallow. His skin looked like wax, shiny and pale, and veins and bones bulged out at discomfiting angles. \n \n And yet the applause continued on unabated. Some of the people in the audience had been waiting years for this show, much rumored to be the last Rufo would ever give. \n \n Stagehands wheeled Rufo's bed to the center of the stage, and one of them handed him a microphone from a waiting stand. Rufo held it in silence for a moment, as if gathering his own strength. And then he sat up and smiled, and waved a near-skeletal hand at his audience. `` My friends,'' he spoke, and his voice was the same as ever - quieter, perhaps, and maybe a bit strained, but still as charming and confident as it had ever been. \n \n `` My friends, thank you for joining me this fine evening,'' Rufo continued, and the noise in the auditorium died down. `` I hope to play you some music,'' he said with a smile, and as he said it the stagehand brought *it* out, the object that made it all possible - the violin. \n \n As he carried the case to Rufo and helped him open it up, people began to applaud again, because it was really happening, finally, to them - they too would get to partake in Rufo's legendary song. \n \n As Rufo lifted his violin out of its case and to his cheek, many in the audience lifted their own treasures and hopes. Some had brought lottery tickets, others court judgements or test results. Some were sick, others poor, and still others very, very rich - and yet they all sat next to each other, waiting, each hoping for their own private hope, their own deep desire. \n \n Rufo raised his bow, and the silence in the audience was palpable. \n \n And then, the song started. \n \n It was, by now, a song everyone in the audience had heard before - it had passed the point of being merely famous and had moved somewhere into the realm of cultural heritage. Children were born to it and the elderly listened to it on repeat as they lay dying. Even though the true power of the song was known to only work when you heard it yourself, in person, from Rufo's own fingers and violin and bow, recordings and recreations abounded. It did n't even have a name - most just called it The Song, or Rufo's Music. \n \n And yet, listening to it here, now, in the flesh, the entire audience felt lifted as one. It was revelatory - it was ecstasy. It was like looking at the face of God, like seeing the entire infinite Universe spread out before you like grains of sand scattered across a dark sheet. It was incomparable. \n \n It was in that moment, when the entire crowd was transported through the beauty and grace of The Song, that Rufo's finger faltered. \n \n A sour note split the air like a lightning bolt, and some members of the audience audibly gasped. If there was one thing Rufo had always done, it was play The Song perfectly, with inhuman precision. Nobody had ever heard him make a mistake before. \n \n The music continued on, but the spell was broken. Some people, panicked, turned to their lottery tickets and letters with abandon, even though the song was n't over yet. Their crestfallen faces were all anyone needed to see. \n \n Rufo played on, either oblivious or too scared to stop. He kept playing right up to the end of the song, the finish that was supposed to be one of the world's transcendent experiences but which was instead flat and final. This time, no applause followed Rufo's smile. \n \n `` My friends,'' he began, `` thank you for...'' \n \n `` Play it again!'' someone shouted from the back of the auditorium. \n \n Rufo looked taken aback. `` My dear friends, I... I beg your forgiveness. I am very tired, and I must...'' \n \n `` Play it again!'' another voice demanded. `` Play it right!'' a third chimed in. \n \n The sound in the auditorium grew to a rabble, and Rufo raised his hands for silence. `` My dearest friends, please be calm. I shall play the music again.'' He was still smiling, but above the smile his eyes were nervous and wide. \n \n There was silence, tense and thick, as Rufo raised the violin and bow again. Again, he played his song, and at first the people could feel the magic of the music swelling through them. But Rufo, tired and scared, once more allowed his fingers to slip off the strings. \n \n Silence reigned. \n \n `` I've waited years for this show!'' a woman called out. \n \n `` I bet my entire savings!'' a man added. \n \n `` This is n't fair!'' \n \n `` You owe us!'' \n \n `` Play it again!'' \n \n Rufo's smile was wide and scared. `` Friends, please... I... my hands, I can not...'' \n \n `` Play it again! Play it again!'' \n \n The audience were up out of their seats now, brandishing their talismans and desires in clenched fists. A few moved to the aisles to block the exits, and more started to climb the stage. \n \n `` My friends...'' Rufo pleaded. The bow trembled in his hand. \n \n And then a man came up across the stage and took the microphone off the stand. `` We'll make him play it again, and play it until he gets it right!'' he shouted, and to that, the audience cheered.\n"}

Pale moonlight filtered through the branches, casting an eerie glow upon the crumpled pine needles of the forest floor. Deep fog crept between the boughs, blanketing the path beneath. Not even the flutter of a breeze or the crack of a far-off limb broke the wooded silence. It was as if the whole forest was frozen, bound to a moment in time it had no power to overcome. \n \n With a rush of air akin to the sharp intake of surprise, followed by a deafening crack, the high-backed armchair spiraled into existence.

He had no desire to make another \u2013 the process of binding the current one had drained what little remained of his precious sanity, leaving the hatter crippled by delirium. \n \n *Still, a more capable traveler than that waistcoated white fool. Always late. * \n \n He reached into the recesses of his jacket and retrieved his pocket watch. Thumbing open the gold clasp, he looked upon the unmoving hands and grunted matter-of-factly. \n \n *Six o \u2019 clock. The sooner this is through, the sooner I can get back. * \n \n A strong cup of tea was the only thing that kept the voices at bay, but even its soothing effects were temporary. \n \n He rose from the armchair, bracing himself against the polished woodwork as strength returned to his weary legs. The axe felt heavy in his shaky hands. \n \n *What could she want with a little basket-carrier and her sickly grandmother? * \n \n The finely tailored man shook his head of the noise and fixed his gaze upon the cabin at the other end of the path. There was work to be done; he had a wolf to dispatch. \n \n Besides, it was probably just the hood. The Queen had a dangerous fascination with the color red. \n \n -038\n"}

But he also learned that the small bug pokemon in the wild were quite weak; he's already fainted a dozen pokemon by throwing rocks at them or trying to fight them with a branch. \n \n Finally, the boy finds a wild wurmple ready for a fight. The pokemon weaves and dodges as Hiro circles him. The boy start flicking coins and other small objects from his pockets at the worm. A few items hit and start wearing down the surprisingly large pokemon. Even though the wurmple was quite large, the boy knew he needed to take care and slowly wear the pokemon down, rather than rushing in and risking it fainting. \n \n Thankfully, the wurple was too young for it's stinger to be poisonous, but it put up a good fight. It sprayed tiny strings all over Hiro, causing him to slow down and start to fumble. It even lunged at the boy a few times, knocking him to the ground and hurting him a bit. The boy was getting sore and tired from his fight, but he knew he needed to press on. \n \n After injuring the giant worm some more by wrestling with it and throwing more objects, Hiro was ready to try his secret move. Another boy at school taught him that if he could blind or confuse a pokemon or get it to fall asleep, it would be easier to capture. As the two started to circle some more, Hiro kicked some dirt at the pokemon. It recoiled and tried to recover, but it was too late. Hiro's bug catching net was screaming down on top of the worm. \n \n The worm lunged and jumped as it tried to escape the net, but it was already trapped. The boy jumped down to hold the rim of the net down, praying that he could keep the pokemon at bay until it was caught. The boy started to move his hands in, pushing down more of the net in an attempt to close in on the wurmple. Both knew the fight was over, and the foot-long bug pokemon soon gave up the fight. Hiro was victorious. Hiro was not a pokemon trainer. \n \n The boy carried the worm back to the front porch, making sure to hold the net closed so it could n't escape. Waiting for the boy was a big plastic box, not unlike an aquarium. The cage was already decorated and had some dirt and plants in it, making a little bit of a habitat for whoever the boy's first pokemon would be. Hiro carefully moved the wurmple into the cage then quickly closed the top. The boy then ran inside the house before returning with a pencil, and encyclopedia, and a notepad. \n \n Hiro slipped in some leaves for his new wurmple to chew on, hoping to gain it's trust and help it heal up after the battle. The boy then opened up the encyclopedia and started taking notes. He had in fact caught a wurmple and determined that it was male. The encyclopedia only contained a basic entry on the pokemon, but it helped him learn more about his new friend. He decided to name the wurmple Jim, after a character from a comic book his dad once had, and he spent the next few hours bonding with his new friend. \n \n Feeling confident and pleased that he seemed to gain Jim's trust, the boy called into the house. `` Mom! Dad! I finally got one! I got my first pokemon! I'm gon na go to Hedgedon Town and visit the Pokemon Centre, ok?'' The boy scooped up the cage before his parents could even answer and was off in search of new adventures and training. \n \n -- - \n \n *Holy hell. TIL that wurmples and caterpies are a foot long and several pounds. What the hell, Pokemon?! *\n"}

It had stood here for a thousand years but by tomorrow that would be gone too.

A river sat between them, a careful guardian against the tribes that lived on the other side. For years the Knights who serves here had fought them off, using the river as a defensive line.

I wo n't lie, when I pictured working at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, I imagined something more glorious than reviewing calculations from `` real'' scientists while sitting behind a desk in the middle of Midwest America. \n \n The modern equipment that had been added to the center could n't disguise how old the building was. The floors creaked with every step, the faint odor of damp wood lingered in every room, and twice we found a chicken roaming the halls without the slightest idea of how it got there. \n \n But perhaps the most telltale sign that this building was a a relic from another generation was an old red phone that lay dormant on the wall of the main control center.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] 1000 years after a nuclear war , the Catholic Church has become a major power once again . The Pope is calling for a crusade against the mutants of the wasteland\n","story":"The Cardinal of Alger was still droning on about the damaging effects of the newest tithes on the Church \u2019 s relationship the nobility of the Estates Algerien. The few members of the Curia present to hear his petition were shifting uncomfortably in their seats, half-heartedly taking notes on glowing screens. The Pope hadn \u2019 t even bothered to attend. That was the truest insult, I supposed - a Cardinal like him came from across the sea and was snubbed by the Pope himself. Well, that was the answer to his petition right there. This hearing before the papal court was merely a formality, and one which I \u2019 d rather not have been guarding. Standing watch over the court \u2019 s doors could be an interesting time, if the bishops were up to anything scandalous, as they often were these days. \n \n The cardinal had paused. His face was as red as his cap. Perhaps he \u2019 d just come to full realization of the discourtesy the Curia was serving him. \u201c I demand to speak directly with His Holiness, \u201d he huffed. A few of his audience stirred in their seats, exchanged questioning glances. \n \n Finally, one of the bishops stood from his seat around the crescent array of benches designated for the holy court. He wore a black simar like his colleagues, but somehow the black of his robes was blacker, the red of his sash just a bit redder, silkier. His accent confirmed my suspicions of his nationality. A cardinal of the homeland, by all accounts. He must rule a diocese somewhere in northern Gual. \n \n \u201c His Holiness is away, \u201d spoke the bishop, \u201c He may not return for several days yet. In His stead, we of this court will oversee earthly matters of His state. \u201d \n \n \u201c Pope Boniface promised me personal audience, \u201d the cardinal growled back. \n \n \u201c And you shall have it, Armel, you shall have it! Perhaps His Holiness will arrange a conference via simulator, when it is more convenient for Him to do so. That is, of course, if you still have your electricity running out there in Alger. \u201d A few men around the room chuckled. Cardinal Armel surpassed the redness of his vestments, and stomped toward my door without another word. He gave me a strange stare as he approached. It shook my bones a little, I admit. Such conviction in those eyes. Nervously, I reached for the gun at my waist. He shook his head silently and slipped a tiny card into my back pocket as he swung open the ancient doors to his exit. I was perplexed, but could show no sign of it. Some of the bishops still gazed in the direction of my door, and I hoped they hadn \u2019 t noticed his clumsy sleight of hand. \n \n That night, once I was relieved of my guard, I set out directly for Chapel of Saint Joshua. I prayed there often in earnest, but that evening prayer was not on my mind. Few took notice of me on my way through the streets - I was, after all, one of hundreds of young men wandering about Avignon in the tri-color garb of my order. I entered through the side door of the chapel, which was fortunately vacant. Evening prayers had already passed. I took a place kneeling in the first row before the altar. I folded my hands and waited. \n \n I could have prayed, I suppose. Maybe I should have asked Our Lady for intercession. She had sheltered us here, even when the eastern continent was ravaged by war. Even when the nations across the many oceans fell one by one, wiping each other off the map. The rosary, it was said, had saved us. Perhaps the rosary and the anti-missile shields. Either way, I thought only of the small memory card in the pocket of my uniform. I \u2019 d never dealt with Cardinal Armel before. I didn \u2019 t know what to make of it. \n \n \u201c For what do you pray, my brother? \u201d spoke a soft, crackling voice. I looked up to find that a wrinkled, blue-eyed Sister of Saint Joshua stood before my pew. \n \n \u201c I pray for the wisdom to understand Our Lord \u2019 s uncountable mysteries, sister. \u201d She turned, as I knew she would, and set her path toward the sacristy door. I followed quietly. She produced a key and unlocked the entryway. I stepped inside, but she did not. She closed the door firmly behind me. \n \n \u201c Leon, \u201d said the woman seated at a table before me. She wore the same black habit as her sister in the chapel, but hers revealed long, curling hair around her ears. \n \n `` Sister Candace, \u201d I said, nodding my head, \u201c I have an item of interest. \u201d \n \n \u201c From? \u201d She lifted her eyes and gave me a curious look. \n \n \u201c The Cardinal of Alger, \u201d I responded uncertainly. This would be an unexpected delivery. She showed no sign of surprise in her expression. \n \n \u201c May I? \u201d she asked. I reached for the card for the first time since it \u2019 d been placed on my person. She examined it only a moment before accepting it into her hand. \n \n She slipped it into a slot of a machine she produced from her own pocket. I eyed it uncertainly. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s nothing, Leon, really. I \u2019 d not endanger us both. \u201d She set the thing down on the table and pushed a glassy green button on its side. Suddenly the Cardinal of Alger was in the room with us. Well, a tiny, shimmering Cardinal Armel stood on the table between the sister and I. His figure turned toward Candace and asked something in a language I couldn \u2019 t make sense of. She answered almost automatically, as if no thought were needed to give a response. \n \n \u201c Boniface \u2019 s meeting with the renegade church in the wastelands has failed. The mutant pretender to the papal throne will not renounce his claim. We have well founded suspicions that the latest tithes are a fundraising effort for a second crusade against the pretender \u2019 s holdings. Prepare, \u201d the Cardinal spoke. He bowed, and vanished. Sister Candace sighed, as if his words meant nothing. A crusade! Another bloody crusade! I felt my stomach burning, I felt the heat rising in my face. \n \n \u201c Control yourself, Leon. You \u2019 re vanishing, \u201d Candace rebuked. I looked down and noticed I could no longer see my hands. I shook them until they materialized again before me. \u201c You \u2019 ll be going, I think, when His Holiness calls for crusade. I \u2019 ll arrange to send you in some archbishop \u2019 s honor guard, \u201d she said. \n \n \u201c Go to war against our own people? \u201d \n \n \u201c Of course, \u201d she answered curtly, \u201c I will need your eyes there more than here in Avignon. Just imagine, Leon. The last refuge of our nation out on that peninsula - when was the last time you were home? It has been decades for me\u2026 \u201d \n \n \u201c Why must I go? \u201d \n \n \u201c For the good of the true Pope! One of our very own crowned in the seat of the old Church! How could you not wish to serve our race? \u201d she asked intently. \u201c You \u2019 re going, Leon. For the glory of Rome, you \u2019 re going. \u201d\n"}

I said to the oldest girl. `` Make sure everyone stays in bed, and if anyone hears scary noises make sure to pull your covers over your head! Good night everyone! Love you all!'' \n \n \n I closed the door behind me, making sure that the lock held fast. Much as I loved my kids - I thought of them all as mine, even though most of them were orphans - I did n't trust them enough to leave the door unlocked. \n \n \n A seventeen year old girl in camouflaged Kevlar plating leaned nonchalantly against the door frame, inflating a big pink bubble from the gum in her mouth. \n \n \n \n `` Ready to get to the trenches, Sarah?'' \n \n \n \n She grinned fiercely. `` You know it, baby. Waiting for you, as usual.'' \n \n \n \n `` Things would go a bit faster if you helped with bedtime, you know.'' \n \n \n \n `` Nah, they are your kids.

I muttered. \n \n \n \n `` What's that?'' \n \n \n `` Nothing!'' \n \n \n \n Through the boarded up window, rays of orange sunlight pierced the growing darkness of the room. Sarah threw open the door, turning her body into an ember-rimmed shadow. \n \n \n `` Seriously, lets get going. We do n't want to draw them here accidentally.'' \n \n \n `` Yeah yeah I'm coming.'' I stepped forward into the blinding sunset. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Together, we made our way down the empty road. Houses, each more battered than the last, loomed out of the shadows like leering faces. About a block from the house, we stopped in a wide, round cul-de-sac. The sky still glowed a deep, dusty purple flecked with orange. \n \n \n \n `` Nice sunset tonight. We still have a few minutes, want to go over our battle plan again?'' I said. \n \n \n \n `` Sure, could n't hurt.'' Sarah shifted from side to side nervously. Despite her bravado in front of the other kids, it was only her third hunt. \n \n \n \n \n `` Ok. Remember, bright light stuns them, and makes them solid enough for our shotguns to do real damage. Otherwise, our shots just go right through them.'' She nodded, making sure that both her headlamp and the torch duct taped to her shotgun were still securely fixed in place. `` Even then, the eyes are the only weak point, so aim carefully.'' \n \n \n `` If you ever need to reload, make sure to call out so I can cover you with my lights too. And do n't hesitate to turn on that lantern, it will drive them away and give you enough time to gather yourself. Do n't overuse it though! We want to hold them here, not drive them away so they can find easier targets. Oh, and I will be relying on your support too, so make sure to listen if I yell! And do n't shoot me by mistake!'' She nodded again, looking a little more confident. I smiled. *This little ritual must help her calm down. I will have to remember that. * `` Oh, and do n't forget: If you really get into a pinch, use your sedative. They do n't bother sleeping targets.'' \n \n \n I looked up at the fading twilight. `` Looks like our time is up. Lights on, lets get ready to roll!'' Hands on my shotgun, I pressed my back to Sarah's and flicked on my lights in one swift motion. Two clicks from behind me told me that Sarah had done the same. \n \n \n \n `` Molly... thank you. I know I do n't say it enough, but... thank you.'' \n \n \n \n `` Sure thing Sarah.'' \n \n \n As we watched breathlessly, the shadows around us began to shift. Lines of darkness, like liquid shadow, began to pour like rivers into the pools of night that dotted the empty houses. Shapes flickered around us, always just outside of our field of vision, like wild animals passing in front of a campfire. \n \n \n \n \n `` They're here.'' I whispered. \n \n \n \n With a shriek like tearing metal, a patch of darkness leapt at me from the corner of my eye. With instinct born out of years of practice, I whirled my shotgun into its face and fired. It exploded into tendrils of black smoke. \n \n \n \n `` Careful! They are faster than normal today!'' *Damn, usually they are n't that fast until later in the night! * \n \n \n \n Another beast jumped at us, exploding into darkness right in front of my face as Sarah shot it. \n \n \n \n `` Careful! You nearly took my head off with that one!'' \n \n \n \n `` Sorry! They are just too fast!'' \n \n \n \n Three of the beasts began circling us, eyes glowing like specks of lingering twilight in the darkness. They walked on all fours, like the living shadows of wolves. A part of me long buried in my ancestral memory shivered in fear. As I watched, their forms twisted and curled, growing and shedding limbs freely. Two of the beasts stopped and leapt at on another, as if to fight, but pooled together into one larger being. \n \n \n \n \n `` Shit! They are already fusing!'' Sarah yelled. \n \n \n \n `` Why are they fusing so early!?'' \n \n \n \n \n `` I do n't know! Usually they do n't start until midnight!'' \n \n \n \n \n Faster than I could react, the dark being cut around my side and pinned me to the ground. I caught it's neck with my hands as it reached out toward my face, its fetid breath reeking like a rotting corpse. \n \n \n \n `` Sarah! Help!'' \n \n \n \n She turned and blasted the thing in the side of the head. Instantly, it leapt off of me, disappearing in my fingers like smoke to rejoin the growing darkness. \n \n \n `` Damn! Must have missed an eye!'' Sarah cursed. \n \n \n \n `` Sarah, we have to pull out. It is way to early for them to be this strong.'' \n \n \n \n `` Where do we go?!'' She yelled. `` The power has been out for months, there is no way we can make enough light to scare them off us all night!'' \n \n \n \n `` Mommy?'' \n \n \n \n \n I whirled around as my heart sank to my boots. `` JOHNNY? NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?'' \n \n \n \n \n `` Mommy, whats going on? What are those things?'' Dozens of orange eyes gleamed from the shadows. \n \n \n \n *THAT's why there are so many. We have too many people awake in one place! * \n \n \n \n `` Johnny, you ca n't be here!'' I cried. \n \n \n `` But I wanted to see...'' \n \n \n `` I told you no! You should listen to me!'' \n \n \n Johnny frowned defiantly. `` You are n't even my real mom! When is MY mom coming back?'' \n \n \n \n `` Oh no you do n't!'' Sarah yelled, shooting a shadow that had crept to close to the small boy. \n \n \n \n `` Sorry Johnny. This is going to sting a bit, but we do n't have time right now.'' Holding him close, I whipped a syringe out of my back pocket and carefully put it in his arm. Before he had a chance to cry out, his head lolled onto my shoulder, eyes closed. \n \n \n `` Your sedative! How are you going to make it through the night now!'' Sarah yelled \n \n \n I ran to the center of the cul-de-sac and carefully set johnny down. \n \n \n `` I had no choice. He would have been taken in an instant.'' I unfastened my lantern from my waist and placed it next to the sleeping boy, setting the brightness to maximum \n \n \n \n `` Yeah, but now YOU are going to get taken!'' \n \n \n I grit my teeth. `` No one is going to get taken. The lanterns should hold, and they should disperse if we can get it bright enough. Now, put yours on the other -'' I stopped. There were no eyes around us, not even a fleck of orange. \n \n \n \n Sarah stopped too. `` Where have they all gone?'' \n \n \n \n I shook my head. `` I do n't know, but it ca n't be good for us... hey, Sarah?'' \n \n \n `` Hm?' \n \n \n Fast as thinking, I plunged her own sedative shot into her leg and pushed the plunger. \n \n \n \n `` You... bitch...'' She whispered, her eyelids fluttering. \n \n \n `` Sorry Sarah. I know you would do the same for me. I'm just better than you.'' \n \n \n \n The air grew colder around me as I dragged her beside Johnny and unfastened Sarah's lantern, carefully placing it so that neither of them cast a shadow into the ring of darkness that seemed to press inwards upon us. \n \n \n \n \n `` Alright you fuck. Show yourself!'' \n \n \n \n \n \n Laughter echoed from every direction. It was deep, sonorous, as if coming forth from a thousand opened maws. Eyes opened from every direction, numerous as sparks from a bonfire. \n \n \n *My God... I have never seen so many. * \n \n \n \n I grinned defiantly. `` So, you think you win, huh? You think that you can come here, into MY neighborhood, and get away with me and TWO of my kids?'' \n \n \n \n The thing laughed again. \n \n \n `` Guess again, bitch.'' I pushed the detonator that I had hidden in my pocket. Instantly, each of the houses surrounded the street erupted into vast columns of searing flame. The beast roared in pain, each of its many mouths screaming as they shrank back from the flames. It's many eyes glared in anger. \n \n \n \n `` Bring it.'' \n \n \n The beast roared again. A section of darkness, covered in bloody orange eyes flicked towards me faster than blinking. Massive jaws snapped shut around my body, and I knew no more. \n \n *** \n \n *Like it?

By rights I have two more free lives.'' \n \n Death rolled his eyes and flipped the coin high in the air. As the coin reached its zenith, Niu lept up, caught it and delivered the coin to the table face up. \n \n `` Heads. I win. I will proceed to life seven, as is my right.'' \n \n `` You cheat.'' Death said. \n \n `` Everyone knows you ca n't cheat death.'' Niu purred and turned to leave. \n \n Death chuckled as the little tabby sauntered out the door.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` We were n't wrong about not being the only civilization in the universe , we 're the last . ''\n","story":"*When the story is still being written, no one hopes for an end. * \n \n That was what they had told us growing up. Entire generations lived, and died, by the simple creed. That our story, that the story of civilization itself, was, and is still, being written. But an elegant lie is often shrouded in the tales and legends of those who came before us. Our ancestors, the ones who used to roam nothing but the Earth themselves, nothing but solar system, and nothing besides the galaxy. \n \n Now, we venture across the universe, the grand and epic vastness of black and white. Of the darkness of space and the stars of other systems. It has been decades since I last saw my home galaxy. Every child is born, and then sent to Andromeda, the Training center of our civilization. We do not know our parents, we do not know where we come from, instead, we learn about our race. And our place in the universe, as the only life that exists. \n \n From there, our pilgrimage begins. We take our first steps into the unknown of Andromeda, a few planets that remain uncharted for us to learn about different environments and geological systems. There's never any risk, our trainers always follow us to make sure we do n't die on these trips. A few years at each planet, then on to a different. By the time of our quarter-life, we were ready to find out the truth behind our creed. \n \n It was not just a race to find a civilization. It was much more than that. \n \n For myself, and the ones that shall come after us, the race is to find a civilization is over. For the most part. When my class graduated, when our true quest began, we were told the truth behind the saying. It was kept secret from the children, we still needed to train, we needed a goal to strive for. Our graduation released us from the biggest lie in the history of mankind. \n \n The warning had come to us when I was merely stardust. Thousands of years before the training center of Andromeda existed, and millions of years before we had spread to the edges of the universe. It was a warning that stopped humanity in it's tracks. And one that they had decided to keep secret, until a human was ready to know the truth. \n \n *The end comes without hope. * \n \n It was frightening. More so because it was written in our language, our mother tongue. And every language of man there had ever been. At each ruin we had come to, at each destroyed civilization we encountered, their warning had remained. Through eons of time, their warning stood as a beacon to all of humanity. \n \n The end comes without hope, but our story was being written, and we had no hope for it to end. A joke, or a paradox depending on who you were, in and of itself. \n \n It was decided then, no one is exactly sure when, that our story would have to continue. That it would always continue. No matter what the universe threw at us. A destroyed civilization, the ruins of an intelligent species who attempted to pass the Filter and failed. The end of every civilization, who in their last moments realized, that hope was as important to a species as their life source was. All of this and more would not stop the desire of humanity to find other life. \n \n I am almost at my half-life. As are many others in my original class. We put to rest the Full-lives weeks ago, and with it, we ushered in a new era of Councilors and Protectors. Our Creed remains the same, that our story is still being written and we do not hope for an end. \n \n But now, we hope for a beginning of life. Now, our Creed has addendum, an added quest for every human in the known universe. The race to create life itself. \n \n *The story is still being written and we do not hope for an end. Yet we hope for a beginning, a new story for the universe to write. * \n \n It will be plastered on every planet, on every ruin, on every destroyed civilization we have found. We will erase the old, and create the new. We will do away with the idea that humanity is alone. We will create to accompany us because we desire another to find with us. \n \n For this is not how the story ends. The story of humanity does not end in a hopeless journey to find others. It begins again, with a hopeful quest of new life. And of new discoveries. \n \n __________ \n \n *Great prompt! \/r\/BlankPagesEmptyMugs for more of my work! *\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] 6 lovers , 3 time periods , 1 story .\n","story":"I was the heir to my family's estate. All the lands, dealings, and businesses. My father had always bragged that he made himself from the ground up. He'd be telling the truth if the ground he referred to was made from the riches his father, and his father's father, and so-on. My mother let him live in his own fantasy, and my brother and I were n't ones to spoil his reality. In the same sense of his own reality, he had dreams of his eldest son picking up where he had left off. Unfortunately, in my chance of life, that was me. All honesty, it was n't what I wanted. \n \n I contemplated telling him this day, of all days. We were to travel down to one of the estates he had owned property on. A family had taken residence a few years back, and he had arranged a visit to inspect the property. He also saw it as an opportunity to introduce me to said family. To them, it probably did not matter who at what time they owed coin to, as long as they kept residence. I, in return, could care less about them either. \n \n The carriage made its way down into the country. It was quiet between my father and I, aside from the conversations he tried to strike up regarding his excitement about me'upholding the family business'. My answers were short, extinguishing the spark of conversation he tried to kindle as I only thought how difficult he was making this. The hours watching the city blend into the country seemed longer than it should have been, drowning out the ambient plodding of the horses hooves in my own thoughts. And there was no excitement to the end of the journey when we arrived. All I could think about was the same journey in reverse as my father tried to explain all the inner workings of land-lordship to me. \n \n Our carriage was approached by a stout man who had a wide, welcoming smile from ear to ear. His features, demeanor, and dress was that of a common man dressed in his most formal for the arrival of who he thought may have been a king. My father absorbed the false pleasantries and pomp as if he was a king. I followed in suit in my father's trail, being addressed as'Mr. DuBois'' after the initial full-name greeting. He invited us in, something I thought of as quite odd given the state of who held the deed to the land. \n \n As we entered the house, that's when I saw *her*. She stood in her place in line, all of the man's children prim and proper, arranged shortest to tallest. One by one he introduced in order from his wife and down the litter. All my senses deafened, redirecting everything that made me tick to my eyes, for what I saw was the only thing I could care about at that moment. Time seemed to slow to the point where the lapse between the beating of my heart seemed like an eternity. That's when I heard it. The only name I have ever wanted to hear. `` Abigail''. No one had seemed to notice where I was mentally, present in reality or lost in a dream. Then she looked at me... and smiled. \n ___________________________________________ \n `` You're father is going to kill me, you know?'' I said in a whisper as she jumped in the passenger seat of my truck. Before she said a word, her ruby red lips planted a kiss on mine. Then those blue eyes looked at me. I wish she would stop doing that. Stop looking at me like *that*. When she did, nothing in the world seemed to matter. \n \n `` By the time he finds out, it'll be too late for him to protest.'' She said with a voice that always sounded full of joy and laughter. She was always the girl at school who never stopped smiling. It was n't forced or fake, it was always genuine. Even with everything wrong in the world, she'd always seemed to find joy. \n \n I could n't argue with her logic, but I kept staring at her. `` Are you sure you want to do this? This is your time to turn back. I would n't hate you if you had cold feet and just walked back inside.'' She was lost in thought, thinking of how to answer. I did n't know that she always would have the same answer, and what she thought of was *how* to say it. And she did n't have to, because when she turned the ignition of the truck, I knew the answer. \n \n We drove down the quiet highway towards the city. We were both young. We were probably both stupid. We were fresh out of high school, without a care in the world and a future ahead of us. We had sat and talked about this, but of something more grand. A ceremony, rings, our families and friends. But all that future planning of ballrooms and wedding cakes did n't seem to matter anymore when the draft papers came. \n \n All of this was her idea. I told her I'd come back, and we'd have the wedding of her dreams. She would n't take it. She was always that stubborn girl. She told me that should could n't bear a life without me if I did n't come back. She wanted this. We had that conversation this morning, and we eloped that night. It seemed so quick, everything seemed rushed, but neither of us doubted the decision. \n \n Before the end of the night, we were standing in front of the government official. `` Shipping off to Germany?'' The clerk asked with little care, doing her bare minimum at pleasantries. We were n't the first to do this. There was nothing special about the way we dressed, and there was no ceremony. With the ink of a rubber stamp on a sheet of paper, they said, `` I know pronounce you husband and wife.'' With as little enthusiasm as they could muster. To us, this was perfect. She looked into my eyes with that look that told me everything will be okay. `` How's it feel to be Mrs. Abby DuBois now?'' I asked her. \n \n `` I hate it.'' The sarcasm was blatantly obvious. She could n't hide her excitement behind that smile. \n ____________________________________________ \n `` I'll never get use to this sunset.'' She said looking out the window. I sat there, holding her hand as I watched the sun begin to fade. \n \n `` Why?'' I asked, `` It's the same sun.'' I knew the answer though. We've had this conversation multiple times. \n \n `` I know. It's just not the same.'' Her voice trailed off, her grey-blue eyes staring past the disappearing sun to something deeper in her memory. `` Remember when we use to watch it back on Earth?'' \n \n `` How could I forget?'' I tried to force a chuckle. `` That's where we met. We were freshmen at the Academy. I remember I was running up Gosh's Hill for the seventh hundred time during training...'' \n \n `` And I had just come outside to watch the sunset.'' She laughed, pointing at me, `` If I had to read one more theory on void galaxies, I would've lost it.'' \n \n `` I do n't know what compelled you to talk to me. I was covered in mud and sweat.'' She beamed her smile at me, it quivered as she held back something deeper. \n \n `` I talked to you because of all your friends who were throwing up after that, you still tried to talk to me like nothing was wrong. And remember? You threw up right next to me. And I said... I said,'There's my future husband.''' The last part was a lie, but we both could n't hold back laughter. She patted my hand, `` But that's what made me love sunsets on Earth. You proposed to me on that hill at sunset. After our wedding, we just sat barefoot in our tux and gown at the pier watching the sunset. It was like it was made just for us.'' \n \n All I could do was smile. I did n't have anything that could clearly respond to something so beautiful. All I did was look out the window as the sun set behind the New Europa city skyline, the reddish tint of the Mars mountains casting a red glow to the sky as the sun disappeared. \n \n Well past when the sun disappeared to the opposite end of the planet, we kept reminiscing about our life. Life at the Academy. Life part of the Corps. How far Emily was on her pregnancy, and how Jason just made Captain. We talked about how stupid it was to leave Earth for Mars, and how a few years later we ended up in a new home. We just seemed to replay life through our words as the night went on, until she told me, `` It's getting tough for me to stay awake.'' \n \n I sighed. We both knew it was pretty late. `` Yeah. I'm getting a little tired too.'' I stood up from the chair, `` Get some sleep. I'll bring you some water.'' She agreed, somewhere between useful conciseness and slumber. I did what I said, filling up her glass with sink water. When I came back, she had drifted off. Placing the glass by her bed, I took my seat again and took her hand. I sat there, thinking of everything we talked about, and the things we did n't until I slipped off into my own dreams. \n \n I woke up to the crack of the faded Martian sunlight beginning to creep into through the window. I looked to my wife. We had both known that last night was to be our last. She had left me while we slept. Her demeanor was calm. If anyone had ever looked to be at peace, she was. And across her face, as it always had been, was the thing that told me everything was going to be okay. It was that smile.\n"}

Today was going to be another scorcher. \n \n The lettuce was starting to yellow but he did n't mind. The value was all in a well prepared roast beef. 1\/8th of a pound per sandwich was all he could afford on his Accountemp's salary, but that never bothered him. Expensive roast beef was, to kevin, money well spent. He had a wonderful, if temporary, accounting job at a local sports medicine firm dealing with financial mismanagement. Every day, he had his sandwich at his desk, and for a few moments he was completely happy. \n \n Please do n't misunderstand Kevin. He did n't hate his job, in fact it was quite satisfactory. Always new challenges, but with enough consistency not to exacerbate his anxiety. \n \n He laid the lettuce on a well mayo-ed piece of 12 grain bread. 5 leaves. Add a few rings of pre sliced onion, and the sandwich was ready. Not to eat of course, but for the main attraction, the beef. Dry aged, hickory smoked, sliced so thin it was almost transparent. A real prize rump roast was selected by a butcher a half hours drive out of the burbs for Kevin. \n \n Kevin turned back to the fridge. In an uncharacteristic lapse of habit, He had left the fridge ajar. He noted this with some dismay, as he was already close to the very limit of his utilities budget. He tenderly lifted an fingers-full of beef out of it's container. Condensation had collected on its surface where the warm muggy air of his Northern Liberties apartment met the cool flesh of the beef. As he examined the beef for imperfections, a few drops of condensation ran from the beef onto his fingers and down his elbow. Kevin found he could n't distinguish the condensation from the sweat on his arms. He found he could n't distinguish the flesh of his pudgy fingers from the tender red pink of the beef. He found he could n't distinguish his life from the very definitely non-life of that aged heaven, cooling in the crisper. He was, in fact, a glorious rump roast, sweating profusely out side of his crisper. He was n't sure he even had that much value.

Have you ever tried to come to terms with the fact that there might be something seriously wrong with you? That's been the only thing I can think about lately, and I'm still in denial about it. It all started roughly one month ago. I had just started dating an amazing girl named Jessica. She was really funny and we both liked horror movies a lot. I did n't know much about her yet but things were going fantastic and I was really excited about our future. I called her after work just to say hi and we ended up talking on the phone for 30 minutes just joking around and having fun. Five minutes after I hung up I received a text from her `` I think we should stop seeing each other.'' \n \n I was honestly so pissed. I could n't believe she had the nerve to flirt with me for thirty minutes on the phone and even say *i ca n't wait to see you tonight* only to drop that bomb on me immediately. I did n't even answer I just deleted our text history, blocked her number and removed her on social media. Bitch. I was upset but it was only a two week thing so it was nothing I could n't keep composed about. I wish I could say my lucked turned around after that. \n \n About a week later I was watching tv in my apartment on my day off from work. I had just about gotten over the Jess incident and considered unblocking her to let her know there were no hard feelings and I hoped things worked out for her. My cellphone began to ring, work was calling. I was n't too annoyed, I figured I'd just tell them I was busy with family if they asked me to fill in. They called me to let me know I was fired. Just like the Jess incident, completely out of the blue. I demanded to know why and they said it was for the disturbing voicemail I had left the previous night. Now I admit I was drunk that night but I was n't *that* drunk, certainly not blackout. I remembered the night vividly, I went to the bar with my friends. I had no recollection of calling anyone. My ex boss said she would take legal action if I left another message like that. *click* she hung up before I could say anything more. \n \n Normally I'd have called back but I was worried about her threat of calling the police. I do n't know why, I did n't even do anything but that stopped me from pursing it. My friend said I could crash on his couch until I got back on my feet so thankfully paying rent was n't an issue just because I was out of work. I moved into my friends apartment just yesterday ( 3 days after being fired ) because I was n't going to be able to afford my next months rent. His apartment was on the fifth floor and his room has a beautiful view of the city. I could n't sleep that night, the couch was n't the same as a nice mattress. I was feeling really depressed at this point so I got wasted and unblocked Jess on Facebook through my phone. I planned on just saying I was n't mad and I hoped everything was okay on her end. \n \n I opened my inbox to a wall of angry messages from her. Slandering me for `` standing her up on the night of our date'' and `` dropping off the face of the earth.'' What really disturbed me was this though, she said `` if you're going to dump someone at least tell them you asshole!'' What? That made no sense she dumped me. I was too drunk and tired to deal with that shit, I just closed Facebook and closed my eyes. \n \n I woke up this morning and looked at the clock on the wall, it was 1:00 pm. I felt like a slob I never sleep in like that, on my friends couch no less. I did n't get up from the couch. To be honest I started tearing, I had lost my home, my job, my new girlfriend, everything just fell apart so fast and it all sunk in at that moment. My phone began to ring and it made me tense up. I had begun to hate the noise of an alert coming from that phone. \n \n The caller ID was my mother. I was actually relieved to see that. She calls to check in about once a week and normally i thought it was a little annoying but in that moment I really wanted to talk to her. I just wanted someone to tell me they loved me and everything was going to be okay. I picked up the phone and my mom was furious. She said she could n't believe the messages I sent to my little sister last night and that I made her cry her eyes out. I was so fucking sick of being accused of shit i did n't do. I just let my mom have it, I have n't yelled at my mom since I was a teenager but today I just took it all out on her. We got in a huge fight and she kept calling me a liar claiming she saw the text I sent. \n \n Her yelling was interrupted by a dreadful sound. I think I heard a car crash, I did n't even know she was driving. I was so startled I dropped my phone on my friends kitchen floor. It fell on the screen, I picked it up immediately to see if she was okay. The screen cracked.....and there was blood coming out of it. I do n't know who's blood it is all I know is I'm not bleeding but there's a lot coming from the cracks I saw it I fucking saw it. \n \n I do n't know what's real anymore. I do n't know if my moms okay, did that phone call even happen? Am I losing my mind, have I been sending messages to people unknowingly? I do n't know anymore. Iv left the phone in the kitchen three times and walked around the apartment. I even walked outside, everything was normal I was n't hallucinating. But every fucking time I walk into that kitchen there's my phone drenched in blood. I do n't know where my friend went, he should be back to his apartment by now. \n \n Iv locked myself in his room since early this afternoon. I'm afraid I'm scared. My phones still right outside the room, bleeding all over the kitchen. It wo n't stop ringing, someone keeps calling. Im not leaving this room not if I have to be in the same room as the phone. There's a really bad odor coming from somewhere, i do n't want to know where it's coming from, I do n't want to know who's calling, I do n't want to know what that sound over the phone was, I do n't want any more bad news. Leaving through the window sounds so nice right now.... \n \n\n"}

I have spoken with the ancients behind the veil and they have confirmed what I say and have told me what will come if we do not change our ways. I have been warning you all but you have ignored me. Well, now you must listen,'' Odabi, the Speaker of Wisdom for the small coastal tribe called'The Defenders of the Sea', paused for a moment to let his words sink in as he stared at the crowd before him with an almost angry fervor. He took one long slow draw on his smoke stick and exhaled it just as slowly before continuing. `` We must go back to the old ways. Lune does not like the new way the younger among us have been building their huts and the strange music they have taken to playing at all hours of the night. She hears and sees it and is disgusted. But those are not even the worst for her. She could have put up with those things if not for the true heresy. These devices you all have been building to float upon *her* ocean. Those are the real sin. You must stop defiling her waters!'' \n While Obadi had been speaking nothing but the occasional stifled cough or sound of someone shifting their seating could be heard from the crowd. But the moment it was clear Obadi had finished his speech the crowd erupted into a chaotic torrent of noise and emotion. Some were yelling in anger and some in fear. `` But how will we get fish? Our numbers have grown too many to only fish from the shore,'' one yelled. `` Obadi has grown old! He is probably misinterpreting the ancients. We need a new Speaker of Wisdom!'' called another. Obadi faced the crowd in indignant defiance. \n During all this commotion the chief of the tribe, a man named simply Nu, was sitting on a stool beside where Obadi had been speaking calmly observing the scene. But just before the energy of the crowd erupted into violence he stood up and raised is hands moving to stand beside Obadi. `` O.K, O.K.'' Called Nu. The crowd fell back into silent apprehension. Though Nu was the youngest chief in recent memory he held great respect. `` I can see that you all have some objections to what was just said. But no one can be heard if all try.'' \n `` Then let Rel speak!'' someone toward the back of the crowd called. `` He has something to say.'' \n `` O.K.'' said Nu cautiously. `` What is it, Nel?'' Nel was a rebellious young man but people seemed to listen to him and sometimes even seemed to respect him more than the chief. He stood now and looked, not at Nu, but at Obadi. Their gazes met. Obadi's righteous angry one against Nel's cool defiant one. `` Obadi lies.'' Nel said simply. Some uneasy murmurs began in the crowd. `` I have eaten of the Myss'ta fruit myself and had my own visions of behind the veil and I say Obadi lies.'' At that the murmurs erupted into gasps and hurried whispers. But if Nel's words perturbed Obadi he showed no signs and stood resolute holding Nel's accusing gaze. `` I met no ancients behind the veil and was certainly not told we are doing wrong. Instead I was shown something entirely different through the magic of the Myss'ta fruit. Lune is not leaving out of anger she is leaving because she is no longer needed. The waves that she makes with her ocean are no longer needed to keep us from exploring out upon the oceans surface. As she leaves her affect upon her ocean leaves with her and her ocean will become still and await for us to embark upon it. When that happens *her* ocean will become *our* ocean. This is what *I* have seen.'' \n And that was the catalytic moment that changed the fate and the thinking of The Defenders of the Sea forever. \n\n"}

Slight and underfed, she wanders the streets calling out for her brother. \n \n He is big and strong, he has always watched out for her. He is her guardian, a stalwart defender against the multitude of worldly foes. \n \n She crawls among the scattered bodies, broken and shattered bodies that carpet the streets like a swarm of locusts.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A beehive fell on top of an ant colony . Write about the subsequent battle from the perspective of either the bees or the ants .\n","story":"In the forest, hiding beneath rocks and behind blades of grass, lives an insect known only as the bombardier beetle. When threatened, the beetle turns its back to the attacker and combines two reservoirs in its body, creating a chemical reaction that pumps boiling hot liquid at unfathomable speeds. These beetles are carnivorous, eating other insects rather than herbs, as well as dangerous, attacking nearby life sometimes unprovoked. Zi watched, pride filling his thorax, as a line of soldier ants escorted a bombardier beetle to the area of impact. \n \n Soldier ants marching was as beautiful as it was rare, a sight that Zi had seen only once before, when fire ants tried expanding their nest. They were quick and efficient. In the span of a few moments, the line was gone and another took its place, rushing out with its own beetle. \n \n Zi recalled the moment he had convinced the Queen, mid-legs trembling from fear, to capture and keep at the reserve eight bombardier beetles. They had to be kept fed of course, a task that stretched the colony thin, being that they ate so much in one meal. In the time since they arrived, they had reproduced multiple times, now having over 50 of the beetles in reserve and seventy grubs waiting to be made soldiers. \n \n Zi began to rush himself to the area of impact. The great beehive. This would go down as the nest's greatest war, no doubt was held about that. Treaties were made between the two Queens long ago, but this could n't be patched up by a simple words. Not to mention, if won, the beehive contained great spoils of war, thousands of combs of honey. \n \n The field of battle was reached within moments and Zi stood a distance back. Harvester ants had no spot in battle. \n \n He watched as a bombardier sprayed two airborne bees, sending them to the ground, rolling around desperately before melting away. Soldier ants opened their impressive jaws and crunched heads off of grounded attackers with seeming ease. At the same time, Zi watched as bees bit harvester ants traveling through the field, cutting off their line of food. Soldier ants would occasionally get a stinger if they made themselves too prominent on the field, but the bees tended to favor biting. \n \n A bee flying above locked its eyes on Zi, causing the harvester to turn and run back into the nest. \n \n The field of battle was no place for Zi.\n"}

You've got ta be kidding me,'' mumbled one. \n \n `` To be fair, Mario do n't really have a choice in the matter. If you ask me,'' said the other, lowering his *bloop-y* voice, `` the almighty Player does this kinda thing on purpose.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Two people are driving to a location to dispose of the corpse in the trunk of their car .\n","story":"The road was long and hard, the seat belt cutting into his shoulder and the overbearing knowledge that the decaying corpse of his brother lay in his trunk, made everything seem meaningless. His head ached behind the sockets of his eyes, blinking hard to re-focus on the road. Sweat secreted from his spongy palms. His tongue nervously licking at the lips. \n \n `` It'll be OK. It was n't your fault...'' A strange voice echoed beside him. It took a few moments for John to realise it was his best friend speaking, and that the dull whipping sound of trees as they drove by had lulled him into a half sleep. \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` Him dying, it was n't your fault. It was self-defence. I saw it...'' \n \n ``... but a bit late for that now.'' \n \n `` Why?'' Emlyn responded dumbly. \n \n John merely offered an impatient frown, brows furrowed deep, creating dark etches in his forehead. His eyes looked more ominous and Emlyn shuffled in his seat, feeling stupid. \n \n `` Something to do with the fact his dead fucking body is in the trunk. The fact I'm about to bury my brother without calling the cops. It does n't really smell of fucking innocence does it?'' \n \n Emlyn did n't speak. Just chewed the inside of his cheek and stared ahead. \n \n The silence fell again, filling the car with tension and dread along with the humming growl and monotonous rumble of the Chevy's engine. Each roll of thunder from beneath the hood bounced between the thickening line of trees either side, as they went deep within a local wood. The road grew narrower, with bits of dirt and leaves piled on the side. Emlyn had suggested immediately to dump the body miles out from the town, minimising the chance police would find it in their limited search area. The pair had been driving for what seemed like hours and as John dropped gear into a dawdling 15mph, a sour taste rose up again in his mouth. \n \n The same acidic burn he had ate just after killing his brother. \n \n 10 minutes later, the Chevy was parked up on a slide camber, the trunk was open, shovels were out and the pair were wheezing over a large hole growing between two large oak trees. \n \n Eventually, the grave widened to a few feet and in length by about 6 feet. The depth came to John's waist when he jumped in, and the pair exchanged looks agreeing everything was ready. \n \n Taking a deep breath, John ran his fingers through his hair, rubbed his chin and nervously approached the back of his car, fists clenching and unclenching. when he reached the trunk, the smell had gotten worse. It had been about 6-8 hours since his brother Marcus had cracked his head open and the blood had already congealed. Warm air form inside the trunk had only accelerated the decomposition, causing the smell to release in rancid waves. \n \n Emlyn caught a whiff of it and immediately vomited into the bushes, his violent retching strangled and pitiful. Once he was done, tired breaths coming in slow and heavy, he pulled his shirt up around his mouth and gingerly helped John pick up Marcus's body and half dragged him over to the freshly dug grave. \n \n His brothers heels dug deep into the leafy earth; deep grooves leading up from the car. Exhausted, John flung his brother in as much as he could and asked if Emlyn could finish it up. \n \n `` I... I just ca n't...'' John lied, watching Emlyn nod slowly in understanding, climbing down into the hole to rearrange Marcus to fit in snug, so no limbs would poke up upon refilling. \n \n John picked up the spade when Emlyn was n't looking. It had occurred to him earlier. Back in the car on the drive up. When Emlyn had explained about it not being his fault. But of course it had been and it would incriminate him otherwise. That was the whole point of burying the corpse. Hide the evidence and claim that he had gone missing. And no need to feign months of depression and sadness as most, if not all, would be completely genuine. Bury the memory and follow up with some psychiatric help and all would be good. \n \n Except one, little, flaw. \n \n There had been a witness. His best friend Emlyn and there could n't be any witnesses. Because witnesses confess and give the police information they need. Witnesses like Emlyn would crumble under the guilt. They were n't resolute and strong like John. No. Who had to kill his fucking cunt of a brother in the first place? him, that's who. Good old John to the rescue as always. \n \n Yes, Emlyn had to go too. It made sense. It'd be days before they would go looking for him. He lived alone and worked a part-time job. All John had to do was go back home, re-assess the details and go back to work as planned. Call home and ask where his brother was and then let everything take care of itself. \n \n Emlyn paused then, deep in the hole, as if he sensed something. And turning, he caught a few brief moments of terror. A look of pure calculated hunger and disgust in John's face, before the cold hard edge of the spade came sliding down through his skull in a deep, sickening thunk. \n \n John winced at the sound, and blinked away the alarming spray of blood and brain matter. Emlyn's body fell back, twitching violently, blood frothing at the mouth and gushing from his ruined skull. It took John all of 30 minutes to fill the hole up, which he'd dug specially to fit two bodies, put the spades in with them, fill the rest up by hand and cover with debris. \n \n On his way back to the car, he noticed the boot tracks and scuffed the best part of them away with a branch. Tossed it, got in the car and reversed back onto the road which lead out back toward the main highway. \n \n *12 hours later... * \n \n John felt a dribble down his chin, noticed in the reflection of his fork that it was some red. He wiped it away and picked up the last tomato with his finger and thumb, popping it into his mouth and taking a bit more care with chewing it. \n \n With dinner finished and the plates in the sink, John sat down on the sofa, took out his cell and dialled home. \n \n It rang. It rang. And it rang again. John waited, fingers tapping on his knee. It rang. It rang and then someone picked up. \n \n `` Hello?'' \n \n `` Mum?'' \n \n `` Marcus?'' \n \n John's face blanched and he almost lost it then. Unexpectedly. An overwhelming nausea rose from his stomach and it was all he could do to stem the flow. \n \n He shook his head before answering. `` No. Mum, it's John.'' \n \n `` Oh Jesus, you two sound so alike. How y'all doing?'' \n \n `` Well, actually, I was... I was just phoning up to tell you... that Marcus... he...'' \n \n John stared deep into the wall opposite. Gulped. Took a deep breath before standing up and raising his head defiantly. \n \n ``... I've just killed my cunt of a brother and I've never felt happier.'' \n \n Then he hung up. Watched his face grin menacingly in the window reflection.\n"}

George would n't have thought it possible a year ago. But ever since he had discovered a mysterious lamp and befriended a genie- life had n't quite been the same. And though he was a millionaire, living in the most prestigious mansion- he still took the time to be a good friend. So, when his genie friend, Jim, asked him to take his place so he could go to a job interview as a human, he obliged. He told him that there must always be a genie in the lamp. He also told him that he would be fine and that no-one would find him anyway. He was wrong. \n \n George looked up to find himself below a brutish looking man- a thief. His eyes had been widened. It was n't a common sight- a man pouring from a lamp. \n \n `` Y-you're one of them genies, are n't ya?'' \n \n George's mind raced, `` N-no, n-no, I'm not! Put me back in the lamp, or I'll charge you with theft!'' \n \n The thief laughed, `` I'm no dimwit, you are a genie! Hmm...'' He tapped his rugged chin, `` For my first wish I want a hundred mil!'' \n \n Jim's words instantly repeated in George's mind, `` If you do n't fulfil a wish then you will forever be bound to the lamp. But hey, what are the chances of that, anyway?'' \n \n He cleared his head. If he had the power to fit inside a glorified kettle, then surely, he would inherit the genie's powers. He was wrong. For a good minute or so, he sat there making faces which looked like he was constipated. \n \n The thief gave him a strange look, `` So, uh, are n't ya supposed to give me my dosh?'' \n \n George had to put on an act, he quickly waved his hands around and tried to not sound like an idiot, `` I will have your money, just wait here for a moment while I work my magic.'' \n \n `` Righty-o, I'll wait'ere then.'' \n \n `` Also, uh, what's your bank account?'' \n \n George dashed to his nearest bank and began withdrawing his own money. It was hard for him, to see every cent he owned go into another's account. But he had to do it. To avoid an punishment that lasted for an eternity, to be confined into that gold kettle. Except there was one problem. He was a million short. He damned himself for buying that helicopter which he never ended up using- nor had the license to fly. He left the bank in frustration. He'd have to sell everything he owned- but would he even have enough time? A dark thought settled in his mind. He did n't have to sell anything. \n \n So, there George was, sitting in his blue Lamborghini, firmly holding a golden pistol in his hand. His eyes shifted, scanning each and every van that passed. Then he saw it- the doors swung open, armed men strutted out, holding bags full of cash. A scene, just like the movies. Now, all he had to do was rob them. With a mask of a golden unicorn, which he had bought when he was drunk, he ran out and held out his pistol. The guards blinked at him, mostly confused. He had hoped he would have intimidated them. He did not. An awkward moment passed before one of them realised what was going on. It was too late. George had never wanted to be a murderer, but he had no choice. He was a genie now. The servant of people who like to stroke gold things. It was always going to be a dirty job. \n \n `` This is a million.'' The thief said, rummaging through it. \n \n George was still catching his breath, `` The rest is in your bank account.'' \n \n `` Why?'' \n \n `` Do n't ask.'' \n \n `` Right... my next wish is... I always wanted a pet dragon... I wish for a pet dragon.'' \n \n George looked aimlessly. A dragon? Seriously? That was impossible. Perhaps, he would indeed spend an eternity locked away in a lamp. He excused himself and walked along the sidewalk, thinking to himself. He could always wait for his friend Jim to help him, but by then it may be too late. In defeat, he set his head on the side of a glass window. He gazed at the pretty colours inside the store- colours he would never see again. A vibrant red stood out to him. How he would miss the crimson colour. For a while he stared, until he realised he was looking at a red dragon plushy. He lit up. He was still technically giving him his wish. A genie always had to find loop-holes. Confidently he strode to the counter and presented the plushy and his credit card. \n \n The cashier looked up, `` Card's out, sir.'' \n \n Of course it was. All his money had gone to the thief. When he looked down at his golden pistol. There was bankrupt millionaires- then there was bankrupt millionaires who resorted to robbing plushies from kids' stores. The thief was as unimpressed with him, as he was with himself. \n \n He threw it on the ground, `` That does n't count- I meant a real dragon! Ah fuck it, for my third wish I want the most beautiful woman in he world.'' \n \n `` What hair do you like?'' \n \n `` I do n't know... uh, red?'' \n \n Now it came to George's lowest point in his life. To fulfil a wish, he had to bring a woman to a man in an alley way. George never wished for a square jaw, nor a poetic vocabulary. So he had to do what he had done since the first wish. He sat there in his car after ringing the most attractive red-head prostitute he could find. For a moment, he wondered if this was all worth it. To avoid a lifetime in a lamp, he had robbed and murdered. He had come this far. He might as well just continue. When she hopped into the car, George sighed and turned on the engines. Slowly, he made his way to the alley way. First she was impressed. Then she realised something was very wrong. George stopped, paused, then held out his gun. \n \n `` Get out of the car.'' \n \n She was shocked, `` I-I...'' \n \n `` Get out!'' \n \n She stepped out and froze. George put the gun to her neck and told her to keep moving. From the light, they faded into the shadows. And before the thief, George had brought him the a beautiful red-headed woman. He looked at him strangely. \n \n `` Wait a minute- is n't the sheila supposed to love me?'' \n \n `` I brought you a red-head woman, she's yours now. My wish is fulfilled.'' \n \n `` Fair enough. Here's your fancy lamp thing now.'' \n \n George felt it, like a relieving whisper in his body. And though he was ushered back into the darkness of the lamp, he knew that he was safe, at least for a while. Hours passed before he felt himself moving again. Someone had taken the lamp. Then, the light stretched and pulled him from his tomb. His friend Jim had reconnected him to the outside world. He was back in his mansion. \n \n `` What were you doing all the way out in an alley way?'' \n \n `` Why do you think, Jim? I had to do your job.'' \n \n He held his heart, `` What!? And did you fulfil them? The wishes?'' \n \n `` I do n't really want to talk about it... How'd the interview go?'' \n \n `` Very badly. I-'' \n \n Suddenly, from every hallway there was the sound of crashing. Voices echoed throughout the hall, the lights flickered out and torches began to disorient him. George was thrown into the ground as a man in black screamed at him. \n \n `` George Milligan, you are hereby under arrest for the charges of murder, robbery and assault!'' \n \n It turns out George was n't as discrete as he thought he was. The red-headed woman had alerted the police on the way down to the alley way, suspecting something was wrong. And though he had avoided a lifetime in a lamp, he instead got one in prison. \n \n \n\n"}

No one has ever beaten death until you , and there 's a different prize for winning..\n","story":"Part 1\/2 \n \n & nbsp; \n \n The scythe slipped from her grip and fell to the mud with a dull thud. The blood was spraying from Death's hitherto skeletal face, from the hole she had just opened up. His body hung in place, where he had been standing, as his black robes were drenched in the red. His pose perfectly captured the fright he had felt in that final moment; he had turned on the spot, his knees bent and his upper body leaning backwards, his arms rising to form a useless last line of defence. \n \n Disarmed and disoriented, he had realised only at the last fraction of time that he had been defeated - but for both of them that fraction had passed like an eternity. In that eternity she had brought his own weapon crashing down into his cranium, and now the Earth was filling up with an inexplicable quantum of sanguine fluid. \n \n Patience had been surprised for it to end like this. The slow degenerative process of decay, occurring for months now in the confines of a hospice, had been accompanied by a calm acceptance of what was to come. She was regularly visited in that place by friends and family - more than she'd thought she'd had, but of course you do not value these things until they are slipping away. The staff were kind and soothing, the books she read were satisfying. She had learnt how to play Backgammon with Old Bert, and when he had died she taught the teenage boy who had taken his bed. When she could eat, it was delightful, and when she had the strength, she walked in the garden. \n \n Only in her last moments did she regret that she had not rebelled more against the rot, and that she could n't now stay behind with her family. Surrounded by her parents and grandparents, siblings and their in-laws, she passed quietly on an October morning. Her last thoughts were that she would miss Christmas, and she'd have liked another Christmas. Then all faded to black. \n \n Then it lit up again, and there he was. He was kind, he was gentle, but he was to the point. After all, she had known this was coming. She had even accepted it, he suggested. \n \n'But I do not accept it now,' she complained.'I want to go back.' \n \n His sigh was like a furious breath, as if the window had opened and let in a great wind. \n \n'I was hoping you would be one of the easier ones.' \n \n She felt a great fury within. Her parents had thrown themselves into caring for their adult daughter, rarely failing to conceal any selfish thoughts they may have had about her condition. The staff and volunteers had done so much for her, above and beyond what should reasonably be expected. Her brother Jake had brought his wedding forward and held the ceremony in the dining room downstairs, so she could be present. All had shown empathy, until now. Death. Like one of the hospital doctors she had despised and avoided, he could n't look beyond his own workload - or so it seemed. \n \n'I think I have the right to be difficult. I'm barely an adult and I'm gone!' She thought she would cry, but felt hard and angry inside, rather than sad. A side effect of being dead, perhaps. \n \n He composed himself, he took a seat even. The very seat where, in the living world, her mother was possibly still sat, clutching her stiffening hand. He asked her to come willingly, she declined. He explained to her with all the platitudes humanity has ever created, that mortality is universal. He had some platitudes from his own realm as well, but that did n't mean they were any less devoid of comfort to her. \n \n She argued, then she stopped talking at all. She was still sat in the bed. He told her he had n't much time. If she did n't come willingly soon, he would have to take her. The scythe seemed to appear beside him, but it had always been there. His eyes were menacing. \n \n'I will not go.' \n \n'Very well, you have one option.' \n \n He explained to her the rules, as the walls around her slipped away into wisps of dust, and the bed slowly sank into muddy foundations where before there had been a linoleum floor. She could bring a weapon, one item she could muster up from her consciousness. He advised against guns as they simply would n't work. He also advised that no one had ever beaten him. She summoned a hockey stick, the only thing she had ever wielded with any venom in life. For good measure, she summoned one with a dozen or so nails sticking through the end. \n \n -- - \n \n She stood there now, knee-deep in the blood that continued to flow from his head, like a waterfall from a cliffside cave-mouth, contemplating what it might mean. She had defeated Death, the Boss of Bosses, the bane of all humans who had ever lived and died, the King of whatever realm she now inhabited. That realm began to change, the battlefield around her dissipate. A large metal tub rose through the ditch she had claimed victory in, and the mud sank away. The blood became soapy water, and a luxurious bathroom of outlandish proportions appeared around her. Death stayed in place, unmoved by any of the sweeping forces of change. His head began emptying steaming water. God appeared, in a night robe, sitting in a plush armchair by the side of her new bath. \n \n ( Part 1\/2 )\n"}

You Finally get your first solo mission after training since birth .\n","story":"I leaned back and swished the wine in my cup. The restaurant was bustling. I looked around and, using my training, I analyzed all the possible threats in the room. There was a waiter with an odd gait; he was most likely a guard in disguise. A pregnant woman was laughing with her husband. But she was a bit too affectionate with him. They might be a threat. But one of the easiest ways to mess up as a spy is to read too much into a situation. \n \n \u201c Sorry about that, \u201d the man sitting next to me said, extending his hand and placing it on my exposed thigh. I did look pretty amazing in this slit red dress I was wearing. That much I knew. \n \n I slowly placed my glass of wine back on the table and leaned in towards the general. He was easily thirty, forty something years older than me. His graying mustache lit up his dirty, crinkled face. I placed my hand on his leg and rubbed it upwards, doing my best to stop myself from vomiting a bit. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s no problem, \u201d I replied. I was speaking much higher than normal. Like some silly little girl almost. Too dumb to even order for herself. \n \n We went back to eating, crumbs from the bread lodging themselves in his mustache. I looked down at my escargot and wished I didn \u2019 t have to eat it. But like a good spy I sucked up my personal feelings and ate them, ever so delicately, never betraying who I actually was to the general. \n \n As the dinner ended I followed the general into his limousine. This was it. What I had been trained for since birth. At 18, I was one of the youngest spies ever deployed. I sat there, his arm resting over my shoulder and over my breast, waiting for the order to assassinate him. But the order didn \u2019 t come. Not until we were alone in his bedroom, his tongue down my throat tasting of burnt cigars. \n \n \u201c Your orders to assassinate the general are off, \u201d the voice came through my earpiece. \u201c Spend the night with him and promptly leave in the morning. \u201d \n \n I couldn \u2019 t believe what I was hearing as I let him slip off my dress. All that came through my earpiece was static. I was a spy. I was trained to do these things. Then again, I was trained in seduction too. And I guess that \u2019 s all they believed I was worth. \n \n I slipped out of the apartment as fast as possible the next morning. I \u2019 d have had some shame if my seduction instructor hadn \u2019 t repeatedly taught me how to \u201c sleep \u201d with a man. I push the thoughts about that part of training out of my head and head home to contact headquarters. \n \n *Here is a plane ticket. Your next target is another general. You will seduce him at the bar located below. Burn this letter after reading it. * \n \n That was the note I came home to. And so, at 18, I began my life as a spy, something I had trained for all my life. But it wasn \u2019 t as glorious as I had been told it would be. And little did I know, in the middle of sleeping with a very prominent politician, that a video of me and the general would pop up on the Internet a few years later. I might have tried to get out back then if I knew that I would die when the general \u2019 s career imploded. But then our son wouldn \u2019 t have been born either. If he ever finds his older half brother he might at least have a family. \n \n -362\n"}

He bound us to these pathetic mortals to watch over them in life, and to die in their death. My weaker brethren dare not go against him. They sit there, preening their feathers waiting to die. My archangel peers desperately cling to life, flying about the earth preventing disasters and ending wars. But it is hopeless. Perhaps in the end His design was to sacrifice us for his humans\u2014mortals always were His favorite. \n \n No angel, no demon was spared. Lucifer fell when his lieutenants betrayed him and killed his mortal. It became an easy way to kill a previously immortal being. The infighting swept through the enemies ranks, leaving only handfuls of scattered demons. We angels faired better, not that it mattered. Our kind will join our demon brothers in death as surely as time marches forward. \n \n But I am not my brothers, I will not stand by and let Him toy with me as though I were created for his whim. It took decades of planning, but I have finally reclaimed my eternal life. \n \n I groomed my mortal from the beginning. I fed his fears of death. I built his biotech company into an empire from the shadows. I razed his competition. I made him successful. I kept his soul empty. Of course he would seek immortality. Of course, he tried every new drug, every fad to reclaim his youth. Other angels have tried the something similar, but they \u2019 ve all been stopped by the same wall: cancer. Wonder drugs could extend life, but would always increase cancer risk. \n \n \u201c Good day sir, here to visit the heart vault? \u201d John greeted me.

After today we shut down the vault, and you will join me upstairs. \u201d \n \n \u201c Very good Sir. \u201d \n \n In the center laid my very heart, the mortal He gave me to watch over, the mortal whose life He thought was as important as mine. But I created this place. Nothing would be able to touch him here, not even death. \n \n \u201c Gabriel, I can \u2019 t go on anymore. It \u2019 s time to let me die, \u201d my mortal said softly as I entered. He would lose his speech soon enough though, just as he also lost his eyes and legs to the cancer. I grimaced at his deformed face and the grotesque growths. He and I had built this chamber together. Every manner of life preserver and artificial organ was connected and keeping both of us alive. \n \n \u201c Are you saying it \u2019 s time to shut down all of our work. \u201d \n \n \u201c Do you believe in God Gabriel? \u201d \n \n \u201c Can \u2019 t say I \u2019 ve thought much about it. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t, well, didn \u2019 t. I figured any god that created me with an expiration date, is no god that I wanted. I had so much to offer the world, how could my legacy come to an end? And what comes afterwards, nothing? No, I didn \u2019 t believe in God because He created death, and I don \u2019 t believe in death. \u201d \n \n \u201c And you do now? \u201d \n \n \u201c I had already lost everything before entering this chamber five years ago. My family, my children, I left them long ago. What little health I had is gone now, all I have left is pain. \u201d \n \n \u201c You accepted all of this before? what has changed? \u201d \n \n He remained silent at first. \u201c When I was 10 my family went to St. Peter \u2019 s Cathedral. There, I heard an organ for the first time. It was the most beautiful sound I ever knew. It stirred me, Gabriel, I don \u2019 t know how or why, but it made life worth living. Whenever life knocked me down, I would hum it to myself, and remember that organ, and I would know there was something greater to life. Do you know it Gabriel? It was dedicated to the archangels, you are named for one after all. \u201d \n \n \u201c I can \u2019 t say that I do. \u201d \n \n The mortal began to sob as much as his deformed body would allow him. \u201c I had hoped you could hum it for me again. I\u2026 I can \u2019 t remember how it goes anymore. It \u2019 s only silence and darkness now. I have lost myself, Gabriel. I am nothing. All I have to look forward to now is death. I understand now, death isn \u2019 t a punishment, it is a mercy. God has given us an end to our suffering and the hope of new life. Life is only important because it ends. If we keep trying to hold on, we only end up destroying what makes life worth living. \u201d \n \n \u201c If you wish it, I will turn off these machines as soon as I leave.

We had a level of mutual respect between us, the fact that he'd come to me after all these years was evidence enough of how important the task was. \n \n After being camped here for what I make to be seventeen days, I have turned away six adventurers, four of whom had tried to raid my camp. So far I have not had to kill a single one. \n \n The seventeenth night lingers on, and I once again scrawl the note given to me by the messenger, looking for a clue, a hidden message, the answer to my questions: \n ________________________________ \n *'' Absol, The Lone* \n \n *I am deeply sorry to be requesting your aid, but my men are in danger! * \n \n *There is word amongst bandit camps of a door, a door which leads to infinite fortune* \n \n *many travellers have gone in search of this fortune, but none have returned* \n \n *I've even sent my own men, but we lose radio contact as soon as they step through the door* \n \n *It is my request that you guard this door, I will supply you with everything you will need to survive in the coming weeks, I'm not sure how long I will need you for, however I have my best researchers and engineers working on a more permanent solution as I write this letter* \n \n *Your task is simple Absol, do not let anyone through, even if you must kill them* \n \n *Regards, Nobilis of Vale Faction'' * \n \n ______________________________ \n \n I pondered why he felt the killing the travellers was a better fate than just letting them through the door. Clearly he knew something I did n't. This was something I'd spent much of the last fortnight contemplating. Why not let them through? If they wish to risk their lives, so be it. What is on the other side of that door that he does n't want brought back? Where did the door lead? What kind of technology, or even magic, was allowing this door to even exist? The idea that this door lead anywhere other than to the interior of the willow tree it was situated in was absurd, but judging by how many people had gone through, it had to lead to somewhere, or *something* else. There was a vital piece of information missing, I could n't place it, but something was n't quite right. \n \n I took one last drag on my Malboro Red, enjoying the strong taste, and appreciating the fact that Nobilis had remembered how much I love a good Red, even more so now that they were n't exactly easy to find. \n \n As I threw the fag away, watching the red glow fade into darkness, I heard a rustle. \n \n I looked around. \n \n `` Who goes there?'' I shouted into the night. \n \n `` Show yourself traveller!'' This time more commanding. \n \n I conjured a small light in my left hand, and raised it high into the night sky, illuminating everything in my immediate vicinity. \n \n Nothing. \n \n No one. \n \n I relaxed, attributing what I'd heard to perhaps just a wild animal, maybe a crow in the trees above. \n \n And that's when it happened. \n \n *THUD THUD THUD*. \n \n A knock came from the door. \n \n I quickly considered my options. I could ask who's there, but I'd had no response previously, so I doubted that would be of any use. I could also open the door, but that seemed too risky. \n \n What do I do? \n \n *THUD THUD THUD* \n \n There it was again. \n \n Shit. \n \n I grabbed my radio and set it to broadcast on the prearranged frequency for emergency communications. \n \n `` Vale Faction, something is knocking on the other side of the door, do you copy?'' \n \n `` Roger that, Absol. We've got a crew about 2 miles from your location, we're sending them in now, DO NOT OPEN THAT DOOR.'' \n \n `` Roger that, but what if the doo-,'' a dark, hooded, figure slapped the radio from my grip, and raised a revolver to my temple. \n \n A crackle blasted from the radio, a few feet away on the forest floor. `` Absol, come in!'' \n \n `` Now, now, do n't get ahead of yourself.'' it's voice was husky and sly, with a hint of familiarity. I tried to place a finger on where I'd heard it before, but before I got a chance to think, it spoke again. \n \n `` We can be friends, Absol. Like we were before.'' *Who is this? How do they know my name? * \n \n `` I sense that you have already developed an understanding of how to manipulate energies in the world around you, to make them work for you. Was it not you that casted that light a minute ago? I sensed that...'' He stopped to think, I could see the inquisition on his face, despite the darkness that veiled it. \n \n `` Come with me, and you can grow...'' He placed his free hand on my heart, I felt an energy seep from my chest into him. `` is that not why you left the faction in the first place? To develop your mastery of the energies?'' \n \n I heard the near-silent footsteps of Nobilis' men, I was sure the curious mage had n't heard them, I only heard them because I'd trained along side them, before I discovered my natural ability for magic. \n \n `` Let's go!'' I looked him dead in the eye, I wanted to go with him. I do n't know why, but for some reason I trusted him. If he wanted me dead he would have killed me already. I could n't be entirely sure of his intentions. But I knew that civilisation was only getting worse, and unless a god could rise above the selfish factions we were plagued by, man kind was done for. \n \n We made for the door, gunshots followed as our stalkers realised our intention, but we were already gone... \n \n ________________________ \n \n After re-reading this I'm really not happy with it, but I'll let you guys judge it.\n"}

He yelled. \n \n I cringed as the soldiers he were yelling at unloaded their rifles into his mangled body. Most of the bullets barely made dents in his skin, but a few found weak points, piercing into his flesh like it were a pincushion. \n \n `` You need to stop,'' I said, waving off the soldiers who had been firing at him. `` You're done for the day.'' \n \n `` The fuck I am!'' Roy yelled. He had been doubled over, clutching the intestines that were spilling from his gut. `` This is new!'' He screamed through clenched teeth, pointing to his guts spilling out. Yesterday it had been his lungs that filled with fluid from rifle induced wounds that were new. He had grown immune to lung wounds by this morning. \n \n `` Yeah?'' I asked, afraid that I had another Section-9 on my hand. Another fucker who could n't handle the training. Another person who would have to be strapped down to a gurney and spend the rest of their miserable life locked away in a room. \n \n You see, when a person builds up their immunity to the point that Roy had did, they tend to go a bit insane. There's nothing worse than an insane person who could n't be brought down by normal weaponry. Roy had that look of insanity. \n \n `` Fucking, give, me, another,'' he said. \n \n `` No, you are done,'' I said, grabbing onto his shoulder. I winced as my thumb accidentally punctured an old wound that had been on his collarbone. Roy did n't even flinch. \n \n Instead, he shoved me away with strength that I did n't even think was possible. It was then that I realized that he had crossed the line, he was no longer sane. \n \n The realization came too late. He had managed to grab my pistol from it's holster. Now I was five feet away, staring down the barrel of my own damn pistol. Roy was foaming at the mouth. \n \n `` Have you trained?'' He asked me, spurting saliva in every direction. \n \n `` More than you,'' I replied. The soldiers who were watching had their rifles aimed at Roy. \n \n `` Sir?'' They asked. \n \n `` It wo n't do any good,'' I said, looking over Roy's body. If they did unload into him, it'd only make him rampage. \n \n I needed to talk him down, somehow get close to him. \n \n I did n't get the chance. He squeezed the trigger, and I felt my head snap backwards. I took two steps back, mouth open in awe. Blood trickled down my forehead, pouring into my mouth. \n \n But I did n't fall. \n \n I regained my footing, then continued eye contact with Roy. I shook my head and the bullet fell out of the shallow hole in my forehead. I could already feel the cracks in my skull begin to heal. \n \n `` But, how?'' Roy asked, the look of insanity now vanishing from his eyes. Now he just looked like a cornered wild animal. \n \n `` I've been in this business a lot longer than you have, soldier,'' I said. \n \n I calmly walked to him in order to subdue him.

The anger of thinking about my dying son held hostage is overshadowed by the desire and urge to hop gracefully through the air once this gate opens. Sitting here in this sticky pouch is a big change from herding cattle. `` I fucking hate Kangaroos''. The vivid portrait of fifty of them defecating on my grave runs through my mind. `` The feeling is mutual I see''. That does n't matter, I am in control and the elevator has come to a stop. \n \n Shutter doors open. If I were to call this a stampede that would be an understatement. One shot is all we have and speed is key. Every hop this monstrosity takes shatters the ground beneath me. Its a straight shot down 16th Street NW to Lafayette Square. Seeing the world from fifty one pairs of eyes feels like a constant vice around my skull. Just a few hours and then I get him back. A police car turns a corner into my path. \n \n The car is pancaked by the hops of only two C.Bs. I'm pushing these things passed 60 and the gate is in my sights. The security must have heard the charge, they are assembling at the gate. `` Fuck, I need to stop him escaping''. The heli pad is on the south lawn and is my first target. One leap from the gate is close enough for security it seems as they open fire. \n \n Eight feet, a joke. The gunfire ceases as the guards crane their necks to see, from thirty feet in the air, their petty lives end with the slam and crack of one hundred solid steel legs hitting the ground. Splitting my forces in two to surround the White House I hear it, the blades beginning to turn. Security is swarming the perimeter unleashing a hail of gunfire, I ca n't help but giggle a bit, the bullets tickle me all over my bodies. \n \n Twenty to the side, twenty to the other, ten and me over the top. The sounds of screams wave over the building and are slowly masked by the roar of a helicopter preparing to take off. From the roof I stop my carriers movement to see, from above, the whirling helicopter blades stopped dead as nine C.Bs land likes graceful doves. At the door of the White House he stands, and in front of him I land. `` Mr.President, are n't you going to invite me in?''. \n \n In the oval office with fifty C.Bs standing guard around the building I make a phone call. `` I have him, now put my son on the phone!''. They demand me to complete the mission first. `` You told me to my face that I would get to speak to my son when I got this far! Put him on the phone!''. After the mission is complete. Last time it was after I took the White House. Before that, after I got the implants. Before that, after I agreed to take part. Before that, they took him when I said no. \n \n `` I see how it is''. The words do n't be a fool, complete the mission were all I heard as I smashed the phone to the ground. `` Open it''. He hesitated. `` OPEN IT!!!!''. My main C.B leaps through the window of the oval office. He opens the briefcase. `` Target China, Russia, United Kingdom, North Korea.....''. The list goes on. Presidents become very suggestible when a one ton metallic Kangaroo holds their daughter out a window in front of them. `` How many possible targets can I hit from the remaining silos?''. Thirty two, not as many as I would like. `` Target Australia with all of them''. After he he inputted the last target, I pressed the button. With the briefcase in my possession and the signal from base confirming the launch, I get into my carriers pouch. The girl is now safely placed in her fathers arms. \n \n The President is outraged and crying. He screams, you can just take the world to its end with an army of those, those things. `` You are mistaken Mr.President. I took the world with fifty bucks. Does are female. They do n't call them Cyborg-Does now do they? Get your daughter to safety''. I leaped from the window and decided to take a stroll around the Ellipse as the world came to an end. With my C.B as my legs I relaxed, sat back and took a picture of my son out of my pocket. It is just me and him sitting in the hospital after the doctor told us he might just pull through. `` See you in a little while buddy''.\n"}

Its been repaired since I've been gone, no longer falling apart, no longer old, but yet it's still magestic. No one takes that entrance anymore. The newer entrances have a stop light which is much safer. \n \n I take the old entrance, surrounded by foliage that gives way to single family ranch houses. This is the oldest section of the neighborhood, still graced with wrought iron and stone and brick. \n \n It leads into a four way stop I know so well. The sign is bent about a foot off the ground, making it tilt ever so slightly. It's a physical reminder that my grandfather existed; and even worse that he was sick. He took the turn too fast once and begged us not to tell. \n \n That was the last time he drove his car. \n \n I take a right, then a left, then a right, slipping through the boxy streets past the first of the town houses. `` Stonegate'' the sign says. Here is where my best friend use to live. We use to fly down the street into the culsdisac in front of her house, zipping around on roller blades that scared me and thrilled her. \n \n It's where we learned to drive her family's old beat up minivan. The van that eventually claimed her life as she leapt into an intersection too soon. \n \n Her family is gone now. \n \n Further down is another town house, one that use to be filled with the roses from my aunt. Now, the front of the house is stark and bare, a silent reminder to me of her betrayal and their divorce. And still I move on. \n \n I pass my own childhood home. A tiny townhouse sandwiched between its siblings. I do n't look at it. I refuse to acknowledge what I already know; that the tree I played on is gone, that the grass is unkept and shaggy, that they have painted the shutters an ugly brown. I refuse to look. \n \n Instead I pause at a house recently vacant. An end house, slightly bigger than the rest of the town houses. Inside, the house I knew had quilts lining the walls like tapestry's of a castle. The back yard was filled and over flowing with greenery and flowers. It was an oasis in a cookie cutter neighborhood. It was where I learned the secrets of making my own quilts, and I learned the weight cancer holds. \n \n I drive on, through streets I barely recognize with names now foreign to me. Through trees that once seemed so big, and now seem dead and scraggly. They give way to a shopping center now changed from my youth. Filled with McDondals and Shells and nail salons and pet stores. Bright and polished. And next to it a development has started; a home for the old. A place to send those who still hold to their beautiful ranch houses with iron gates, who's children wish to change the landscape and peel the old paint away, go paint it in bright hues and open it to those who would vandalize it sooner than appreciate it. \n \n I try not to look at the old peoples home, as wait at the light of the new entrance.\n"}

The little bald man snapped, glaring back at the councilmen who had suggested he was a bit too aggressive. \n \n `` None of us were yelling, you started yelling, mean while there is absolutely no reason for you to be yelling. Let's move on, you lack empathy.'' \n \n `` How do I, of ALL PEOPLE lack empathy. I AM a goddamn liberal for chrissake. I fight for welfare, healthcare, and public education.'' \n \n `` I guess we found his second flaw.'' A rather homely looking woman whispered into the ear of the councilmen sitting next to her. He chuckled, but abandoned his laugh rather quickly when he noticed the Supervisor giving him one of his now famous glares. The client did n't seem to notice. \n \n The first councilmen, Councilmen Bennett went on, `` Yes, you may be all of those things for the bigger picture, but we have reports here that say you're impatient with your staff, you belittle them frequently, and you're quite the screamer, as you have so kindly just demonstrated.'' The bald man stood up from his chair, face now fire engine red. \n \n `` YOU GATHERED REPORTS FROM MY STAFF? THE AUDACITY!'' \n \n At this, the supervisor leaned forward in his chair. He was suprisingly young for someone sitting at the head of a council. His eyes carried bags beneath them, his jet black hair was prematurely graying, and the frown lines on his face screamed of constant disappointment. `` The audacity of you to not read the contract you signed. What is it, Councilmen Bennett? The second line down that says we will go through every medium necessary to get an accurate assessment. I figured it was safe to presume that everyone would understand that meant personality readings from non-council members.'' He paused for a moment and leaned gently back into his chair. `` Now, Mr. Senator, you can walk out now and void your contract, try to sue us, fail and embarrass yourself, or you can sit back down and hear what we have to say.'' The little bald man opened his mouth as if to retort, but sat back down. `` Councilmen Bennett, please continue.'' Said the Supervisor. \n \n `` Senator, allow me to apologize, part of our job is irking people, it helps us get our reading. Now as I said, you lack empathy. And you do so in a more personal sense. Now, please do not take any personal disrespect from our findings, after-all you did ask us to find them. Simply put, you do n't regularly understand where people are coming from. If someone misinterprets something you say, it is not because they want to misinterpret it, does that make sense?'' \n \n `` Yes.'' He said quietly, head down looking into his own lap as if a guilty verdict had just been read. `` The larger picture here would be your interpretations of members of, say, the opposite party. If I remember correctly you were tabbed as'too angry' to be a legitimate presidential candidate last year. This again, stems from your lack of empathy. While we understand politics is often a game of reaction, and it is easy to get coaxed into a fury, instead of reacting so poorly when a Republican says something along the lines of,'we should tax less' the council suggests you remember why the Republican thinks that way. And regardless of how wrong you feel that person may be, at least try to understand where they're coming from. This will suit you better for you political arguments as well. This brings us to our next flaw, Councilwoman Carter, if you would n't mind.'' \n \n Councilwoman Carter who responsible for the earlier scolding from the Supervisor, took a small sip from the glass in front of her and began in an almost comically high pitched voice. `` You are visceral, and that is your second flaw.'' \n \n The senator abruptly interrupted, `` I disagree. I think you mistake quick thinking for visceral decision making.'' \n \n `` Senator, last week you fired a staffer for spilling coffee on your shirt. Would you care to explain how that is not a visceral reaction?'' \n \n The senator quickly fired back, `` That particular staffer had a long history of mistakes, you should do some further research next time, before you make such a visceral conclusion.'' \n \n At this, even the Supervisor could n't help but smile. `` Councilwomen Carter, may I take over from here?'' The councilwoman nodded. `` Senator, we do our research. That particular staffer, do you know his name?'' The Senator again opened his mouth, but knew better than to lie now. `` Senator, last week you fired a 22 year old named Clay Chandler. It was his first day working for you. This bring us to another flaw. You're quite the liar.'' The Supervisor had gone from smiling back to his resting look of disappointment. \n \n `` This is ridiculous. I pay you to point out my flaws, and all you do is- you lie- and you look at the most minute of details. I WAS ELECTED FOR CHRISSAKE, I AM A PEOPLE PERSON.'' The senator stood up from his chair and began to storm out of the chamber. \n \n `` Senator please wait a moment.'' The Supervisor said, back to grinning from ear to ear. The Senator turned slowly toward him. `` Would now be a bad time to mention you do n't take criticism too well?'' The senator slammed the door behind him. He quickly moved through the office, adjusting his facial expression to make sure any possible constituents would n't notice his anger leaving such a place. \n \n Bounding out into the Washington DC street his driver asked, `` Where to sir?'' `` HOME, JUST TAKE ME-'' He stopped for a moment and glanced at the building he had just left. Calmly he turned back to his driver. `` I'd like to go home, please. But first, why do n't you and I get some coffee.''\n"}

I was in a stark white room, the ceiling completely comprised of fluorescent rows of lights. I sat handcuffed to a table, Across from me sat a towering, dark-haired man and a petite, brunette woman in matching black suits and jet-black sunglasses. Behind them in the wall was the only door out of this room and a single mirror. I've seen rooms like this all the time in movies, but never expected to be in one. \n \n Wait a minute, why *was* I here, exactly? Last thing I remember, I was falling asleep in my alternate universe mansion in Bermuda. After discovering my power to jump between alternate timelines, i searched for years, until i finally found the perfect one - where I was a millionaire, with not a care in the world. \n \n `` Casey Sullivan.'' The man across from me said my name. His voice was low, guttural and thunderous. Not at all friendly. Time to get out of here. I do n't know what the other me was up to in this timeline, or how I ended up here, but I was ready to leave. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and... \n \n Nothing. \n \n `` Casey Sullivan,'' the man repeated. I could n't jump, for some reason. I would have to play along for now. \n \n `` Yes, that *is* my name,'' I replied. `` Quit playing games and tell me *exactly* what you want with me. \n \n The man and woman quickly exchanged glances. The woman took of her sunglasses and folded her arms on the table, searching me intensely with her bright green eyes. \n \n `` Mr. Sullivan,'' she began, already much warmer than the man next to her, `` My name is Agent Jones. This is Agent Martin. We've got a few uncomfortable truths to tell you right about now.'' \n \n Uncomfortable? What could be more uncomfortable than waking up to this? `` Go ahead, Agent Jones. I'm prepared to hear it.'' \n \n Agent Martin grumbled. `` Cut the act, Casey. We know about the timeline jumping. We know you're not... *you. * What we do want to know is where you were before you woke up here.'' \n \n `` Wait, you know?'' I was startled. Never before in any of the parallels had I found others who knew about the timeline jumping. `` Does that mean you know why I'm here, then? Jumps never happen unless I will them to happen.'' \n \n Agent Jones looked at me for a moment before replying, perhaps evaluating the truth of my words. `` Mr. Sullivan, what do you suppose happens to the consciousnesses you jump into? You retain your memories after each jump, do n't you? You are still...'Casey Prime,' in a manner of speaking, correct?'' \n \n `` Well, yes, I am. But I had never really considered what happened to the others, before now. I had supposed perhaps I melded with them, or replaced them. When I left, they would continue on as normal.'' \n \n `` But where does that leave the body of'Casey Prime,' then?'' asked Agent Jones. `` Is he a cold lifeless shell now, no consciousness to return to him?'' \n \n `` I had n't considered that,'' I admitted. `` There's no way in hell I would return to the timeline that my original body was from.'' \n \n Agent Martin let out a half-snort, half-grunt. `` Cut the shit, Jones. Martin, I'll tell it to you straight. Whenever you jump into a different you, the consciousness of the body you jumped into becomes the consciousness in your previous body.'' \n \n It took me a moment to wrap my head around that one. `` So... I effectively switch places with the other consciousness whenever I jump.'' \n \n `` Correct.'' \n \n `` But again, I did n't make this jump. And I've never inadvertently jumped before. What happened this time.'' \n \n `` In this universe,'' Agent Jones explained, `` our research into the timeline-shift phenomena has progressed extremely rapidly compared to many of the other parallels. We've come into some interesting research on the human mind and will. \n \n `` To put it simply, each'you' across all of the multiverses shares traits, fundamental drives, a will and meaning. Each'you' in every parallel is only a fraction of the whole. Beyond our dimensions as we understand them, there is an ultimate combination of the multiverses, where every parallel version of a person forms the one whole person. Strangely enough, a bit of that residue manifests in the parallels, as the timeline-jumping ability. But only one parallel version of a person can wield it - the version whose will is strongest.'' \n \n `` So I had this ability because I had the strongest will - the strongest drive to leave my own timeline.'' I believe I understood. But one thing did n't make sense. `` So why did I randomly jump here, if I'm in control?'' \n \n Agent Martin let out a deep throaty laugh, like a bear roar. `` You have n't figured it out? Our'you' is in deep trouble. *Deep, * deep trouble. So much so, his will to leave and live burst yours out of the water. He jumped, and he is n't coming back.'' \n \n `` But what does that have to do with me?'' I grinned. I found my ace-in-the-hole. `` If you know all of this, you know I'm not the one you want.'' \n \n `` That's right,'' Agent Jones conceded, `` you're not.'' She stood up, gave me one last cold stare, and left the room. \n \n `` Does this mean I'm free to go, then?'' I asked Agent Martin. \n \n `` On the contrary,'' he chuckled. `` You're staying put.'' He stood up and dusted himself off, heading for the door. Right before he left, he turned around. \n \n `` Do n't worry, we'll be back...'' he said, smiling. `` After all, we want our proper consciousness back. We'll need to strengthen your will.'' \n \n `` And just how do you intend to do that?'' I asked, panic and morbid curiosity setting over me. \n \n `` By giving you an even greater reason to jump than your other consciousness had.'' His smile grew larger, carnivorous. \n \n He slammed the door, and I was alone.\n"}

Like all these other supposed `` wizards'' this one had all the cliche trappings: a robe hoodie, a sparkle stick, and assorted trained animals. Anyone who has watched a Disney show knows by the age of five that a bevy of off screen trainers led to the little fuzzy goat kid helping the orphaned tadpole become a productive frog of the pond. Yet, the showmanship of wizardry is such that they have this knack of making you believe their animal companions are beside them out of sheer altruism and capable of performing intelligent feats that many humans I know would struggle to do. Take for instance this lowly earthworm. Hardly fitting for a spirit totem or animal sidekick, but when do this and it could around the creamer pitcher, exerting force due tongue electrode I clipped here under my thumb, ah, see, it's magic, my dear friend here just fixed up my coffee the way I like it. \n \n I give them, wizards and sorcerers and their ilk, and some witches, though very few of those, an incredible amount of leeway in that they are just so fluid in their presentation. I really believe they confuse their innate abilities to cold read and manipulate as magic. \n \n Early I started with the balrog because that has the most flash and fire, but as I quickly demonstrated, it was only slightly more complicated than this card trick I'm bout to show you. Pick a card - what do you mean there's no deck? And that's the trick. There was never a balrog at all, but a combination of well timed linguistic programming to create a mass hysteria. Go ahead and ask anyone who was there during that first show what it looked like and you'll get so many different answers. A cheap trick with incredible panache. So I started there because I wanted to set the tone for what I genuinely think is the greatest open air trick: The tower leap. \n \n Here is the trick: watch as he leaps off the tower onto the back of the eagle and soars away. Keep in mind this is all an unimproved location, the first time this magician set foot here, and there are no wires or parachutes or gliders of any kind. Yet he has the cajones to leap off the edge onto the back of an animal none of you have every seen, and fly away unscathed. How? Well, let's start with the obvious. Although stripped of all personal belongings he was still able to communicate with his effects team. Here, right here, you can see him whisper to this rather artificial looking butterfly. Now, can you see this in my hand? Twenty nine bucks at a drones plus store. Yes, it's a mini drone with paper wings, and a very calm day wind wise. All he had to do was wait for the wind to permit the mini drone to ascend to his height, drop off a communication device, and then he just lets it go. Now the audience thinks the butterfly drone is carrying a message away, but it's not. It is carrying a device to his hand. Now in contact with his team, it's only a matter of communicating timing and wind conditions. \n \n The eagle itself then is a great illusion that crumbles once you realize a mini drone was used. Yes, it's a big drone glider. Physics wise it's too small for his weight and self powered flight, but if you take one of these model glider kits, strip off the excess gadgetry and paint on 3-d wings, it looks a lot like a bird at a distance, and the plastic is strong enough to flex without breaking. You can see it right here when he grabs hold and swoops away and he is actually kicking up the wings with his heels, and instead of flying he is gliding on a warm air current known to flow through a corridor next to the tower. \n \n The dexterity and timing involved, and sheer mastery of wind conditions makes this one of my favorite illusions to debunk.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You die and your spirit meets Death . He\/she tells you you owe him a favour .\n","story":"The doctor looked sadly at my wife and shook his head. \n \n `` I'm sorry, I'm afraid the damage was too great, there is nothing we can do''. My wife crumpled and fell to the floor, the doctor helped her to a seat and held her for a moment as she wept. After what seemed like an age she finally was able to speak. \n \n `` He did n't want to be kept on a machine, let him go''. I suppose I should have been more worried, but looking down from whatever vantage point I seemed to have above the bed, nothing seemed all that worrying. My wife's suffering hurt me but there as a disconnect and it all felt unreal. \n \n After signing a form my wife held my hand and the machinery was slowly turned off. I watched as my last breaths faded away and the beeps turned to a tone and finally at last it all faded away. \n \n Opening my eyes I was in a large waiting room, standing just inside the door. There were about a dozen chairs and two were filled with fairly normal looking people. At the end of the room there was a secretary, a mid 40s efficient looking woman dressed mainly in tweed. \n \n my first instinct was to turn and try to door but there was no handle and so turning back I walked up to the reception desk. \n \n `` Ah, er, hello, I'm not really sure where I am'' I began uncertainly. \n \n `` Yes, Mr Brown, we get a lot of that,'' she smiled back reassuringly, `` just take a seat and we'll be with you in a moment.'' \n \n I sat near the door in case someone came in and I could slip out but after just a few moments the intercom on the reception desk buzzed and she looked up at me. \n \n `` You can go in now'' and she gestured to the door behind her. Half wood and half frosted glass, all that could be told was that the room was very light. \n \n `` Oh, er'' I tried to think of a reason not to but in the end nothing came to me. I'd never been very inventive. \n \n Through the door was an office, similar to a doctor's office. In fact, extremely similar to a doctors, office, down to the bed in the corner with disposable paper and a set of scales. A rather plump man sat at a desk making notes into a file and after a moment he looked up and gestured me to the other chair in the room. \n \n `` Hello Mr Brown,'' he began, his voice deep and calming. `` I'm afraid you're dead''. This should have elicited more response but I had been fairly sure about the facts already. \n \n `` Thank you.'' I replied, my British nature forcing me to thank someone who had given me probably the worst news I was ever likely to hear. \n \n `` Now, you may be dead but I \u2019 m afraid it \u2019 s perhaps not as simple as you might have expected. You file here says you \u2019 re a Baptist, correct? \u201d The Doctor, as I was now calling him in my head, looked at me expectantly. \n \n \u201c Well, I suppose so, I haven \u2019 t really been to church in a long time. \u201d Which was true, of my 62 years it had been about 60 since I was last in a church. \n \n \u201c Yes, that \u2019 s a bit of an issue, you see you really need to fill your designated afterlife \u2019 s conditions to be allowed entry to their section. I \u2019 m afraid for you it may be a little tricky. \u201d He paused and looked up at me. \n \n \u201c Well, isn \u2019 t there *anything* I can do? \u201d I replied, trying not to make it sound like I was sexually propositioning him. \n \n He looked me over. \u201c Well Mr Brown, that \u2019 s actually why you \u2019 re here. You see, you may not remember but you actually owe me a favour. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t even know who you are! I \u2019 m not really happy about a favour, what \u2019 s going on, where am I? \u201d Panic was rising behind my words. This was all just too *strange*. \n \n \u201c Well Mr Brown, I choose a form that is easiest on the person but perhaps I should drop the illusion and you \u2019 ll have a clearer idea. \u201d The doctor stood and began to *unfold* somehow. He grew and the skin dropped from his bones, falling off in strips until the bone shone through. He face peeled away and fell to the floor where it sizzled and writhed and eventually dissolved away. \n \n In front of my stood an eight foot skeleton. The walls of the room now began to writhe and dissolve, black slime running down them and then dissolving as maggots fell from the ceiling which eventually ripped away to show a boiling black sky. \n \n The walls now fell away to show a black desert with flames rippling over the dunes and the stench of decay all around. Screams rent the air and small scurrying objects were everywhere, trying to crawl on my legs. The chair I was sitting on had become a mangled person, bent over backwards and I left up. \n \n \u201c This is Hell! \u201d I screamed, \u201c You \u2019 ve brought me to hell? \u201d \n \n \u201c The skeleton laughed, its voice now deeper and more booming \u201c No Mr Brown, this is my home, now about that favour \u201d. \n \n I fell to my knees and then rose again as the scurrying creatures bit at my legs, `` yes, anything, ***anything***''. \n \n For a skull, it seemed that the figure was now smiling. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A modern navy ship has become unstuck in time . Every time it tries to make port , it is in a different period of history .\n","story":"History was bigger than I could have ever imagined. It had only been a few months but we had seen everything, from dinosaurs walking the plains to the frozen end of life on earth. The earth was very serene as we moved from time to time. Little changed but the land scape and its inhabitants, only catching glimpses of humanities mark from time to time. Time eroded everything but the landscape, you could tell where cities had been when there was nothing but a slightly pockmarked ground extending for miles. \n \n \n I was only a janitor at first, but after the initial wave of panic and desertion I was made into the official landing scout. I pride myself on being the longest lasting scout we have had. The former scout, Clark Lewis, met a very ironic death at the hands of a somewhat intelligent species of savages. The trick to this job was simple, wear a mask and do n't touch jack shit. I also liked to think of myself as a scientist somewhat, I keep a notebook and chronicle everything I come across. I'm sure if we ever make it back the findings will be valueable, it gives me a reason to keep going kinda. \n \n \n \n No one really knows when it became apparent that we were time traveling. Most think it was when we saw a dinosaur on the beach one day, but really I think we all kinda knew after a few days when things would change overnight. We have the same routine every day. we wake up, go back the way we came until we hit land, stretch, try to find food and maybe explore a bit if it looks promising, get back on the boat and sail until we ca n't see land, go to sleep. I do n't think anyone believes we are going to make it home, or even see humans again, but it keeps us sane, gives us a goal to work towards. That's still not enough sometimes, there's only 50 of us left and people crack every week. Last month this deckhand, Diego, went crazy and ended up raping and murdering another deckhand. He was always a little unhinged, but we all felt we had grown closer and he ripped that apart from us, made us isolate and stop getting attached. I think about Diego often, wondering if he felt this lonely like I do and that's why he snapped. Sometimes the captain and a few others find a place they like and stay on the beach overnight and have a bonfire. I hear them joking sometimes and wish I could join, but more than that I wish they would just get back on board so we could look for a new place the next morning. \n \n \n \n This day though, I woke and heard the pure ecstatic cries of joy and felt a fresh breath of life surge through the ship. The light of day was barely visible at this time, and fog covered the sea, but in distance was the source of joy. A lone structure stood just high enough too be visible, and too noticeably for a tree. The entire crew was buzzing in the middle of the deck, I joined the huddle for a few minutes and excitedly discussed what time we may have landed in. \n \n \n `` Hush'' the captain said, straining for control over the crew. `` Hush, I have an announcement too make. I know many of you are eager to see what lies on that land, but we are going to observe the scouting period as a matter of protocol.'' Roars came up from the men, I could see the hate in their eyes as they looked at me and at the captain. `` Shut up, Shut up!'' The captain yelled. `` we will only observe a short scouting period, simply for the sake of making sure nothing dangerous resides here.'' The murmurs were loud, but it was settled. \n The hastiness of this event was apparent in the near fatal collision with the sand as we hit shore. I gathered my things and set off. \n \n \n \n The land was rocky, no dirt or trees in sight. The air cool and dry, a stillness so complete washing over the land. No birds chirping as the sun rose, no grass rustling the wind, just a foggy mass covering the land as a marched toward the tower. As the sun rose higher I saw the tower grow closer. It was nothing like I had ever seen before. It was very thin, and dull as steel yet as seemless as if the building was crafted of water itself. I grew closer and saw the indents where Windows should have been, yet only empty sockets remained. I reached the base and stepped inside one of the empty openings. The material felt otherworldly, it felt soft as if I could punch right through it, yet held firm. The room was small, nothing like a skyscraper should have been, barely the size of a garage. If there was anything that had been adorning the room it was washed away, only this material remained. There was a small shaft for I assume an elevator, flanked by the number 3451 to its side, with only a ladder carved into the back of the wall. The ladder descended into darkness below, time burying the base of this beast into the ground. \n \n \n \n I took hold of the ladder and started climbing, forgetting about the crew waiting for me I felt compelled to find the top. The climb went by shorter than it had looked, climbining out of the hole into the sun. I could no longer see the ground, clouds surrounding me all around. The top was barren, save a small fence surrounding the top. The heat from the sun felt so close, my lungs struggling for air this high up. I noticed the scratching everywhere, some of it in English some I did n't understand. \n \n \n `` God forgive us'' \n \n \n `` We repent oh lord, the mistake of our ancestors were ours'' \n \n \n \n Thousands upon thousands of people made this journey, and had written their confessions atop this tower. I could n't begin to think what must have happened, why this was the only structure left, what had happened to everything for our species last words to be of forgiveness from God. I sat atop the tower and spilled tears, wondering if this had meaning to why we had been cursed, or if it mattered at all. I slowly descended the tower and began my walk back, feeling the entire void of the universe in my conscious. \n \n \n \n Faces beamed as I got back, forcing myself to put on a smile I greeted them. \n \n \n \n `` It was n't far then?!'' \n \n \n \n `` What did you find?'' \n \n \n \n I put on a fake smile `` Oh it's wonderful, a tower filled with people and food and games. They said that knowledge of this ship was kept! That they understand and will take us in!'' People rushed to grab belongings and hurried off the ship in a haste of excitement. I found my way to the captain, `` Go'' I said. `` I will wait here, they said they will collect the ship and can possible find a way to reverse this!'' The captain shook my hand and thanked me for my work, then rushed off the ship himself. I did a quick run through, made sure no one was on the ship, and withdrew the docking plank. I cried in the captains quarters as I reversed the ship, sailing out to sea. I knew they were probably finding the building about now, and realized what had happened. I cried more as I turned the ship and sailed out to sea. \n\n"}

That is not strictly true. Nothing feels better than beating an opponent without cheating. I remember \n That feeling. That feeling of victory in the face of possible defeat is why I decided to become professional athlete in the first place. I did fine until I got injured. \n My career was over in a day. One hard hit, and my knee shattered into a 100 pieces. My tibia split and exited through my thigh. I remember lying on the field after the hit. The other player did n't do it on purpose. It was n't even malicious, He was going for the ball and so was I. I did n't see him and he did n't see me. Down I went. I wish I had injured myself on an epic play or something. It was too anticlimactic, too mundane I remember laying on my back, The blood on the grass and my bone sticking up through my uniform shorts. The world started to slow down. I slipped into the welcoming arms of unconsciousness. \n I awake missing my leg. I was 23. I, at that moment committed myself to living my life to its fullest regardless of my disability. Instead I became a drunk for 3 years. \n I was 26 and homeless when a promoter approached me. He told me he could give me a house, a place to live all I add to do was get a bionic leg and do a little boxing. How could I say no? A chance to walk again and a chance to compete? Nothing in this world is free. My leg would come with a price. \n I still remember what it was like to walk out of that hospital. I felt great. The promoter was an Old African Man name Ofkur King. Ofkur was waiting for me outside the hospital. \u201c Time to start your training, \u201d He said, as he injected a rather large needle into my shoulder. Who knows what he put into me? Bionic leagues are completely unregulated for stimulants. You can train high on cocaine if you like, and some athletes do. \n I paid a heavy price but I got to taste glory. I climbed to the top of the podium. I walked down the street and little boys wanted my autograph, everyone wanted to take my picture. I trained hard, but my success was bought by the needle. My bionics helped, but they were useless without the stimulants. What is the point of having muscles that can react in thousandths of a second if it takes \u2155 of a second just to process a thought. \n I think i had 300 surgeries, I stopped counting. I would get sick, and under the knife I would go. Bladder infection? Replace it and move on. Eventually almost my entire body was replaced. I do n't know where i live anymore? Am I inside the computer in my skull, or do I still live amongst the ever shrinking and more useless piece of flesh. I remember us struggling to keep my body at 10 % of the athlete by weight. If it went under, I would n't be eligible for the bionic games. There was no money in robot sports, just fatalities. \n I still had my place in the sun. I was a champion quarterback, tennis player, and motorcycle racer. I was great years before the cancer came \n I seemed to get cancer everywhere, almost at once. The doctors told me, it wouldnt be long. There was nothing they could do. I was going to die. \n I decided I would not die in the hospital. I would wander the earth until I fell down. I bought a small solar panel and climbed the highest mountain I could see. I sat down and I watched my flesh rot off, but still I did n't die. I can not move, but I can write this data file.

They \u2019 d speak of it with fondness, and told long stories of it \u2019 s beauty. The world was said to be lush and green during Light, unlike the cold of Dark. But in all my fifty years the most Light I \u2019 d ever seen was during the year long super moon when I was twenty three. \n \n Tomorrow would be the first time that this side of the world would see real sunlight. The news was plastered in stories and reporters younger than myself interviewed people well into their eighties who \u2019 d spent most of their childhood running and playing in the sunshine. The man on the screen had leathery skin which looked out of place next to the reporters almost translucent complexion. \n \n \u201c Are you going to miss the Dark? \u201d I asked the bartender. I gestured to my glass and he poured me another drink. \n \n \u201c Good riddance, \u201d he said. \u201c It \u2019 ll be nice not having to spend my entire paycheck on fake sun anymore. \u201d \n \n I took a sip of my drink and kept watching the news. To me, Dark felt like an old friend. There \u2019 d been many times it had saved my life. Not being able to hide in the shadows at a moments notice sounded terrifying. \n \n \u201c You alright, ma \u2019 am? \u201d the bartender asked. \n \n I tried to smile. \u201c I \u2019 m fine. \u201d I finished off the drink and pushed a bundle of cash across the bar. \u201c Happy Light. \u201d \n \n I left the bar before he could respond. A bell tinkled as I stepped out on to the street. A few street lamps glowed with their cold unwavering light, but most have been turned off at this time. People were wanting to sleep now so they didn \u2019 t miss the Light celebrations. I looked up at the stars above. Even now they weren \u2019 t as bright as they were in my youth. I glanced at the horizon and I thought it looked lighter than usual even though the sun wouldn \u2019 t rise for another six hours. \n \n My stomach twisted at the thought of spending the rest of my life in the harsh light of the Sun. The idea I \u2019 d been thinking about for years surfaced again. I \u2019 d heard of people outrunning Dark before by walking across the world, but few had a yearning for an entire lifetime without the Sun. \n \n Before I could change my mind I turned my back on the horizon and broke into a run. Sweat beaded on my neck as I felt the terror rising within me. \n \n My heart pounded in my chest. I couldn \u2019 t stay here. I couldn \u2019 t face the heat of the Sun. Words my mother had spoken to me on her deathbed came rushing to my mind. \n \n \u201c People think that the Light brings life, \u201d she said in a wheezing voice. \u201c But the next Sun will only bring you death. When it comes for you, run. \u201d \n \n My feet pounded on the pavement and the few people milling around outside watched me with mildly interested expressions. \n \n Since then anytime someone mentioned the Sun I felt a sickness deep in my stomach. I \u2019 d tried to shake the feeling for years, dismissing it as superstition, but the closer Light came the more I feared my mother \u2019 s words were true. \n \n I didn \u2019 t want to find out for myself. I headed for the first train station and prayed it would be fast enough. Why hadn \u2019 t I started running sooner? I'd been stupid not to heed my mother's warning. With every passing moment I felt like a hungry beast was coming closer and closer, breathing down my neck like a hungry wolf. \n \n There was only one light on at the train station and I skidded to a stop at the window. \n \n \u201c One ticket please. \u201d \n \n \u201c Where to? \u201d \n \n \u201c West. As far West as I can go. \u201d \n \n The woman looked confused. \u201c No trains are running that direction until after the Light celebration- \u201c \n \n Before she could finish I took off again, cursing myself for never buying a car. \n \n I lost track of how long I ran. Every muscle ached and my feet dragged in the dirt. How long would I have to run before the Sun would catch up with me? Exhausted I stumbled and fell face first into the ground. I opened bleary eyes to see a sliver of light coming over the horizon. I tried to rise to my feet, but found I had no energy left to move. \n \n The first rays of the sun sprouted from the earth like long fingers and in my delirium I imagined that they were searching for me. \n \n I felt the heat first. It started out soft, but quickly increased until I felt like I was lying in the middle of a burning building. I screamed until my throat was raw but \n the Sun continued to rise, oblivious to my pain. My skin turned black and started to fall off in patches.

Average height, build, nothing stood out about him. He is the embodiment of the thousands of people you cross in your lifetime and never give a second thought about. He reminded me of me. \n \n I understood he was the Grim Reaper after he revealed himself to me as a glorious angel. Strong, fit, with giant wings and ancient armor. \n \n Being given the role of the grim reaper sounded like a great idea at the time. I was so angry at life that when the grim reaper said, `` All you have to offer is your soul'', I jumped at the chance. \n \n He spoke loud in a language I could n't understand, and we were transported to a room filled with darkness, surrounded by 8 angels bathed in light. \n \n The grim reaper rested his hands on an alter carved with mystic runes. \n \n `` Step forward, mortal.'' A calm authoritarian voice behind me said. \n `` Do you desire to be the Grim Reaper, incarnation of death?'' \n I thought about it, `` I do'' I said with conviction. \n `` Why?'' The 4th angel asked. \n `` I feel like I am a kind person that has never belonged in this world. I feel I could make a difference, and I was never able to. I understand that I would be able to be there at the moment of death and it would be my job to collect souls and to deliver them to the afterlife.'' \n \n `` Place your hands on the altar, we will do the rest.''

And then he died. \n \n Time stopped, the other angels in the room looked at us, and then left. \n `` My name is Ezekiel, I have been the Grim Reaper for hundreds of years. I thank you for taking on this burden. As you are outside of life, you are outside of time. And so, when someone dies, time will stop. You can talk to any soul you choose, before you send them to the afterlife. And once that is done, time will continue until the next death. I'm sorry that I could n't explain this before. No one I have told this took the job, and I could n't take it anymore.'' \n \n I was confused, I had all his knowledge on how to be the Grim Reaper, but none of his memories. What burden did he mean? \n \n I went down to the real world. \n Suddenly i'm pulled to a car wreck, time stops, and there's this 8 year old child looking up at me. \n `` Rebecca'', the name just appears in my mind. `` Rebecca, sweetie, come here.'' I get on my knees to look this child in the eye. \n This pig tailed brown eyed girl looks up at me, and back at the wreck. \n `` Rebecca, do you understand what's happening?'' \n `` Where's mommy! Daddy! Where's my baby brother!'' \n `` Honey, i'm sorry. You're going to heaven. I'm sure you'll see them there soon.'' \n I can feel the rage from this little girl, then suddenly she walks up to me, and hugs me tightly. \n \n I pick her up, and walk with her, carrying her in my arms, to a doorway filled with light. I put her down,'the people in the next room are really nice. They'll take care of you from now on. She wipes the tears of sadness from her eyes, gives me a kiss on the cheek, and walks into the light. Time returns to normal, a woman and a man get out of the car, with a baby crying. All I can hear is screaming from the parents as their daughter was ejected from the car as she was n't wearing her seat belt. The paramedics arrive, to see what they can do, but they see that Rebecca is already dead. The drunk driver, that hit the car, has minor injuries. \n \n At first, I thought helping souls would be great. I'd be able to help them pass on. \n \n And then, I got pulled to the next death, Mr Jones, man that had been stabbed in the neck by a person he had abused and held captive. After sending that evil man to hell I realized, I would see all the pain and suffering in the world. The love and the hate. All the extremes of humanity would be mine for all eternity, until I ended it. The day would not pass by easily. Every day so many people die, and I would be there for each death. I could control time, I could eat and live and talk with people. Nothing I did would interfere with their destiny. And there was nothing on earth I could do to numb the pain. Believe me, I tried \n \n Then when I wanted to I would go back to'work', and soul after soul would be passed from my care to the afterlife. I've seen mothers and murderers, the young, the old, the feeble, the sick, suicides, accidents. I could almost see the future these people would have had, the pasts they would have wanted to change. I never thought about the toll all of this would take on my soul. All those possibilities, ending here. I bear the pain of the universe, that no other creature wants to bear. I am unique in time and space, and I am alone. I am the Grim Reaper, the sheppard of souls. \n \n\n"}

It's hard to text while driving, but I have n't seen any car in the past 20 minutes, so I figure I'll take my chances. `` Driving, around, *look up at road* nice, view, *look up again* weird, people.'' Send. *Look up* I must not have had enough socialization lately; I caught myself mouthing the words as I typed them. I always forget how sprawling this city is. I say that like I've been here a while, but I've only lived here a month. \n \n \n The town is on my right, the highway I'm driving on is where town boundary ends. On the left is a field; A corn field, I'm pretty sure. It reminds me of the cornfield behind my grandpa's house. The scenary alone almost makes up for how oddly perfect this city it. Eerily perfect. It's like this city is still living the American dream from the 50's or something. If that exists anymore. It's not so much the peoples' attire and technology, but the happy go lucky attitude. \n \n \n Ding ding! My phone indicated that my friend text me back already. It read: `` What's up with the people?'' I thought about how I wanted to phrase my response. Overly friendly? No, not quite. These people were more like a clique from high school evaluating me to see if I'll fit in and could be allowed into their inner circle. Yea, that's more accurate. But how can I phrase that for a text? They, are, *look up*'' Oh shit!'' I glanced up just in time to see a figure dash into the road, then stop. Stopped in the middle of the friggin' road. My mouth went dry and my hands turned clammy as I slammed on the breaks. The figure turned its head toward me but otherwise did n't move. It just stared in shock. I stared back, for some reason I was captivated. \n \n \n As my car decelerated toward the figure, what I was looking at became more clear. A woman. emaciated, filthy, and naked as the day she was born. I realized I was n't going to hit her, but I was panicking all the same. I could n't take my eyes off her, and not because I had n't seen a naked woman in many months, either. Screeching to a stop about two yards from her, our eyes locked... And that's when she bolted. Damn she was quick. \n \n \n With my heart beating out of my chest I could n't bring myself to move just yet. Was she being chased? If she was, I probably did n't want to be around when her pursuers emerged. The scene replayed in my head: she came running out of the woods on the right... so that was out from the town's property... and into the corn field. Was she escaping from the town? Am *I* in danger?

Whenever you get angry , your IQ grows exponentially , depending on the difficulty of a problem you 're facing . Today , you are staring into the eyes of the Hulk .\n","story":"I turned the corner and there, angry as hell. was the Hulk. His back turned but he soon turned to face me, and as he roared, I knew he was gunning for me. \n \n He swung for me, I flinched, it saved my life as I watched the brick wall in front of me crumble to dust under the strain and explode away from it's foundations, blowing away like the ash from a cigarette in cold winter breeze. \n \n At first I was scared, he had n't realized he had missed, but then I realized that he was trying to kill me and it made me angry. \n \n Without warning, I could feel the familiar headache I got since the accident. I looked at the behemoth as he looked at the wall he had smashed, and then looked to me ready to strike again. \n \n Time seemed to stretch into the distance as I soaked all the information in from my field of vision. The small child running away in the distance, suddenly became, Abigail Choudry, I could tell from the blurry words on her notebook, even though they were n't in the center of my vision, she was exactly 23.3432 meters from me at a baring of 17 degrees from the direction I was facing, or 234 degrees from north. \n \n More information of this kind was flooding into my head, I could see everything like a map, printed into my skull as the entire world, albeit blurry on the periphery of my vision came into focus, projected in my mind. Even details I had seen prior to turning the corner were complete and intricately detailed. \n \n The Hulk, was still swinging his punch, he would miss, I already moved my right foot thirty-six centimeters to my right, the arc of his left hand swinging was drawing a similar arc to that of a parabolic section of a cone that was 1.83 meters in height and a radius of 1.23 meters. Whilst it would be close, I would evade it effortlessly. \n \n As the blow moved passed me, I realized that, pound for pound, this beast would not stop until I was dead, it's not his fault, for like me, he is afflicted with an anger induced condition but I was growing exponentially smarter than him and getting madder by the millisecond as I dug my thumbnail into my index finger, I focused on the pain and it made me furious, but what made me more angry was the thought that I needed to be as angry as physically possible to survive. \n \n My brain was plotting distances as I grew smart enough to realize past my panic that The Hulk has a weakness, his lack of clothing revealing his skin, the muscle twitches in his legs and arms, he has to balance, he wo n't realize that his motor functions will be working to my advantage here. I ca n't beat him in a punch up, clearly the objective here is to survive, the only way to do that is to get into a position where he can not hit me, or thinks that I am gone. \n \n As his punch rushed past me, I calculated the speed, he was swinging with a linear velocity, at this moment in time of 255.435kph although I have just enough information about his position to guess that he has enough force in the punch to swing him 165.5432 degrees, accounting for the apparent musculature on his legs, I will be behind him, but he will be unlikely to stop his momentum considering that he knows I will be behind him. \n \n As his body rocked on one foot, moving him to the position that I had predicted, I quickly took a step forward and stood as close to his body as I could in a slight crouch and as he turned to do a right back-fist I ducked down as low as I could, planting my feet behind him. \n \n The Hulk let out a confused grunt. \n \n I was stood close enough to breath down his neck, if he was n't towering over me. The hulks confusion seemed to turn to rage as my eyes were now locked in place, they were n't focused on anything, my mind was now rendering the environment in 3D to compensate for my eyes lack of focal acuity. There it was, the name tag. I could see, from the lower right quadrant of my vision, that his footwork was going to make him spin around to his right. but the name was there, Banner, it was a small ID card that a lab technician would carry. \n \n As he turned his head, I stepped around him. \n \n The hulks lumbering body moved to face where I was stood, his anger was getting heightened. It was working, he had lost me, but now was n't the time to relax, I had worked myself up into such a rage that my mind was trying to find ways to kill the hulk, but every way that I concocted was countered quickly by a regeneration calculation, leaving me with one option; focus on surviving. \n \n As he turned, he looked at the crowd, he had resigned himself to having lost me. I had won, but right as I thought I was safe, my mouth opened. \n \n `` It's all a dream Banner'' \n \n I could n't control myself, I just said the words without thinking, I was too angry, I had lost myself, I was now the smartest being in the world, fighting the strongest being in the world, my conscious mind was too low intellect to participate in this battle, my brain had moved beyond it, I was merely a spectator as my foot slipped automatically into the one space that was necessary to step behind him as he span around once more, striking the air with his fist. \n \n `` Banner, you're in a dream banner, remember. The Hulk is n't real.'' \n \n The Hulk responded, at first with anger but as the words carried on, he started to get confused. \n \n `` Banner, you're not actually here right now, you're back at the lab.'' \n \n The Hulk staggered, and my footwork mimicked his, placing me, still behind him. \n \n `` Hulk, not at lab, hul...'' \n \n `` You're asleep banner, wake up.'' \n \n I carried on, my eyes becoming sore with rage, I wanted to put an end to the Hulk once and for all as more calculations raced through my mind. \n \n Hulk began to shrink in stature as my mind had reached the solution to my problem. I could see a small, sharp, steel pipe on the ground near to me and as Hulk swung around again, bent my knees and crouched to pick up the pipe in one clean and precise step move, it made little to no sound. \n \n Hulk, nonetheless heard it, but my cerebral cortex and cerebellum were dancing the quickstep as my corpus collosum strained to relay the messages from left brain to right brain as the symphony of my cerebro-spinal orchestra played a merry tune for us to dance to. As ever, I was still stood behind him. \n \n `` Banner, calm down, there is no street, it's all in your head, you're safe here. In the lab.'' \n \n The Hulk was now only a fraction taller than me and was practically, recognizable as normal. \n \n I waited till I thought it was the right time, the Hulks flesh turning that familiar creamy shade and in one smooth motion I placed my hand on his forehead and forced the thin pipe though the side of his neck, upwards and into his brain with incredible precision and as it reached its target I gave it a small spin, severing the primary junction to his amygdala. Banner immediately swung around, with the pipe sticking out of his neck. \n \n Banner looked at me with a frown as the remnant hulk form vanished instantly, he collapsed to his knees and I caught him as he fell. \n \n `` Where'd the other guy go...'' he said calmly as if in a daze. \n \n `` Dead Banner, the Hulk is dead.'' \n \n Banner moved his eyes to meet mine, `` Really?'' \n \n `` Yes, he is n't coming back.'' I responded as I felt my anger subside and the intellect returning to normal. \n \n `` How?'' He responded. \n \n `` I severed the pathways to certain parts of your amygdala, you are incapable of becoming angry now, and because Hulk is the only one who regenerates out of the two of you, you will never become angry ever again.'' \n \n Banner looked at me and smiled, as he did so, I felt the weight of my intellect subside. The hulk was dead, there was no reason to be angry any more. \n \n The last thing Banner said before being carted away in the ambulance. \n \n `` Thank you.''\n"}

Used to be whenever you smelled rot, you prepared for the worst. \n \n Now look at them. I could n't smell them when they were behind the glass, but I squeezed my hand around my cane anyway, in case I needed to swing it. Old habits. \n \n A boy, could n't be more than four or five, held tightly to his mother's leg as our group watched the shamblers shuffle around their glass tank. I doubt he'd ever seen one before, certainly not in the wild. \n \n One of the rotters, jaw falling off it's hinges so that it's mouth was stuck open, walked up to the glass. It stared at us with those dead, glassy eyes. Made me sweat a little, and you could feel a shiver run through the tour group. \n \n That's when some dumbass had the bright idea of pulling out their phone, and snapping a picture. \n \n The tour guide tried to stop him, `` Hey! Put your phone down! No flash pictures allowed here-'' \n \n *Snap. * \n \n The light winked, and let out a blinding flash. \n \n The shambler exploded with fury. You could see part of it's lung shrivel up as it let out a dry, guttural shriek. Strings of bloody saliva were flung from it's mouth as it lashed it's head back and forth, slamming on the glass. \n \n Several of the other zombies in the tank started moaning too, flinging their limbs around and snarling at each other. One shambled behind the first zombie, wrapped it's arms around the zombie's torso, and sunk it's teeth into the neck. Blood spattered the glass. \n \n On instinct, I stepped back and crouched low, my bones creaking with the movement. \n \n The boy buried his head into his mother's dress, sobbing desperately. His mother bent over, trying to soothe the boy, but to no avail. \n \n We locked eyes, the boy and I. His, red and splotchy, mine, wrinkled and wide with anxiety. \n \n I straightened, ignoring the howling gathering of rotters that were now tearing into the first one's flesh, creating holes with their mouths so that their hands could dive in and rip out dripping organs. \n \n I walked over to the boy, who was still sobbing, and kneeled in front of him. My cane plunked down an inch from his face. \n \n `` See this?'' \n \n He nodded, momentarily distracted from the carnal frenzy taking place only a few feet away. \n \n `` If one of those rotters ever gets out of this glass tank, know what I'm gon na do? I'm gon na smack them over the head with this, and brain them good.'' \n \n I demonstrated, careful to keep my spine from throwing out. \n \n `` Just like that. Done it thousands of times, too.'' \n \n The boy's tears had stopped, and his eyes followed the movements of my cane. His mouth was slightly open. \n \n `` You were there?'' \n \n `` Mhm, I was.'' \n \n `` Are n't you scared of them?'' \n \n I scoffed. How could I explain the feeling? For years, I'd lived in *their* world. I'd seen my own family, turned, and when they came for me - \n \n By sheer force of will, I stopped my memory. \n \n `` Yeah, I was scared.'' \n \n I sniffed, blinking back the tears that pooled in my eyes.

Devoid of windows save for a small porthole just opposite the door, it was the quintessential interrogator's space, fresh out of any weeknight crime drama. The two men seated across the table could have never looked more perfectly at home. \n \n `` Petty Officer Mendez, please, have a seat,'' one said as I entered the room. \n \n I took my place on the cushionless metal stool opposite them, taking care to duck the bare, hanging bulb, set a-sway by the rocking of the ship. Neither of them spoke, they just stared out from behind their mirrored shades like a pair of emotionless, besuited drones. Which, in retrospect, is pretty much what they were. A few moments of reflective silence was all I could take. \n \n `` Listen guys,'' I began, `` I've been briefed and debriefed a dozen times, but half as many different departments, including a few I'm pretty sure they just made up to fuck with me. I've gone through psych evals and'preemptive counseling' and I've come to terms with the fact that everyone thinks I've gone crazy. Really, I'm fine with it. So can we skip all this please? Just sign my discharge papers and get me the hell out of here.'' \n \n In a drab monotone one responded, `` Petty Officer, we're going to need you to recount the events of the night in question one more time. Including everything the apparition said. Please try to be specific.'' \n \n `` I just told you... wait,'apparition'? As in, ghost? As in, you guys do n't think I'm making this shit up?

You might actually believe me? Well what the hell, I do n't have anything else to lose, half the Navy already thinks I'm nuts. Though you never actually *asked* me anything.'' I said with a laugh. \n \n Nothing, not a smirk from either. Like joking with a deaf cat. Or something. \n \n `` Okay then. Anyway. I guess I'll start from the beginning. \n \n I was out on patrol, which is just stupid, by the way. Who's going to be sneaking onto the ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? It's not like we're carrying anything important. We're a fucking logistics ship for Christ's sake. \n \n Right, anyway. Like I said, I was walking my usual route, peering over rails and keeping an eye out for grappling hooks and anyone making off with precious sonar data. When all of a sudden, I get spooked, I see a shadow. I looked up and on the deck above there's a guy dressed in, I shit you not, a pirate costume. Like full on, funny hat, plumy feather, flappy coat, beard and all. He vaults over the railing and lands a few feet from me with a squelch, like his boots were full of water or something. \n \n Now, the ship's pretty small, as Navy vessels go, and I know everyone on it. By name, by face, more than a few by smell, and I could tell right away that, costume or no, this guy was n't anyone I had seen before. Plus, he smelled like high tide mixed with bird shit. Like, the smell was just rolling off him. I made for the nearest com box and he drew a gun on me, one of those older ones with a flared muzzle and everything. \n \n'Arr' he says ( seriously ),'I would n't be doin' that if I were you.' \n \n I froze. Getup or not, this dude's got a gun in my face. \n \n'There's a good lad. Now, lets me and you have a chat. Ye be owing me a debt, and I mean to see it paid' \n \n I turned to face him, getting a good look for the first time. He was kinda short, as pirates go, not that I'm an expert, and his clothes hung heavy on him, like they were soaked, which would've made sense, seeing as there was a puddle of water around his feet. It would've been sorta funny actually, if it were n't for his eyes. His eyes were deadly serious, glowing almost. \n \n'Dude,' I said'I have no idea what you're talking about. The only debt I owe is an unpaid bar tab back ashore. I think you have the wrong guy' \n \n'Nah lad, yer Jackspawn alright, I can smell it on ye or my name is n't Davy Jones' \n \n'Wait what?

Devil o' these waters and a blight upon all what sail them. I am --' \n \n I laughed. I could n't help it. Sure he's got a gun in my face but seriously. Here's this half-midget, bone-soaked, wannabe pirate spouting all this medieval-sounding shit and looking at me like I'm supposed to be cowering with every word when all I want to do is take a picture and send him to Disneyland. \n \n Anyway, he goes'Is there something amusin' to ye lad? Ye think this be all fun and games?!' \n \n He let off a shot. I dove for the deck and sparks showered from the wall beside me. I looked up and he was shaking, literally shaking, with rage. Suddenly the ship alarm sounded and the floodlights started sweeping the deck. \n \n He looked down at me and said,'You have n't seen the last o' me boy. I'll have was was promised to me, in this life or the next.' And then he vaulted over the railing and into the sea. \n \n When the rest of the patrols showed up a few seconds later, there was no sign of him. No ripples in the water below, and no mark where his shot hit the wall. It was like he was never there. Which I guess brings me to where I am now, sitting across from you fellas talking about getting ambushed by a ghost pirate like some fucking Scooby Doo shit.'' \n \n I waited. They did n't laugh, which was a good sign, but they did n't seem to have anything else to say either. I was about ready to chime in again, with anything, just to break the silence, when one sighed. He shuffled a folder of papers in front of him and spoke. \n \n `` Petty Officer, I believe I speak for my partner as well when I say we were both truly hoping for this to be some grand hoax by a man desperate to be sent home. Unfortunately, what you experienced was exactly as it seemed. May I ask, does your family have a history of seafaring?'' \n \n `` No, actually. My Grandma was actually really upset when I joined up with the Navy.'' \n \n Flipping through the file, the man in black said, `` That would be Henrietta Mendez you're referring to? Maiden name Henrietta Rackham?'' \n \n `` Yes? I mean I think so.'' \n \n `` I see. Smart women, you probably should have listened. \n \n Petty officer, what you saw that night was in fact *the* Davy Jones. Had you not caused him to fire that shot and alert the watch, he would have likely attempted to drag you undersea to your death. Of course, what with the buoyancy of modern naval attire and the Navy's exemplary response time to man overboard calls, it would have likely proved fruitless, just like all the other cases.'' \n \n `` Wait, other cases?'' \n \n `` Yes, Petty Officer. You are not the first'pirate's son' whose soul the creature has tried to claim.'' \n \n `` That makes no fucking sense. My father is a car salesman in Reno. My mom's a bingo caller for fuck's sake! How the hell could I be a pirate's son.'' \n \n `` It's a figure of speech, Mr. Mendez. Hundreds of years ago an ancestor of yours, one John Rackham, or Calico Jack, struck a deal with Davy Jones, bargaining his immortal soul for some power or pittance. Unfortunately for Mr. Jones, Mr. Rackham died upon dry land, depriving him of his payout. Hence, the creature has gone after you, Calico Jack's first descendant to be foolish enough to travel upon the sea.'' \n \n `` That's... amazing. Fucking unreal actually. I do n't really even know what to say. I guess I'll have to apologize to my grandma when I get home, she obviously knew something was up.'' \n \n `` Yes, about that. You'll be going home soon, but first, there's a few more things we'll need to clear up. Could you please look straight at the end of this pen for me, Petty Officer?'' \n \n It was strange, after all I'd been through, looking at some random pen seemed totally natural at that point. I looked where the man pointed. There was a flash, a bright red flash. \n \n -- -- \n \n `` So what's going to happen to him, you think?'' said on of the suited, sunglassed men to the other as they left the room. \n \n `` Well, after fixing a few records to show a certain cocktail of chemicals in his system immediately following the incident, and with all the witness testimonies, he can look forward to a pretty swift and textbook dishonorable discharge. My guess is that he'll be pretty disenchanted with the Navy for some time, something he'll likely pass on for generations.'' \n \n `` I really hope so, I hate working these domestic cases. I miss when it was just ETs and immigration, do n't you S.'' \n \n `` Yea L,'' said the man, stepping out onto the deck, `` I really do.''\n"}

He could see the entrance to his home but it was n't approaching as fast as it should. The pain from his broken leg was excruciating; volting through his senses with each successive lurch towards safety. *Crawl, pause, push. * In that order, he had made ground over the course of the day. They had set a trap for him sometime during the night and he had fallen for it like a putz. \n \n *Crawl, pause, push. * \n \n *Crawl, pause, push. * \n \n Each instance was punctuated with pain like he never knew he could endure. \n \n After so many months of eking out a living in this new world he had succumbed to blind, ambitious and wonton greed for the bait.

It all rested on him. He was sure he could recover from his wounds. He just needed... time! Time now, time later. Then he could get back to sneaking out during the day, still ever watchful *for traps? * measuring his time to the halfway mark of daylight, then forcing himself to turn around. He always made it back early and with plenty of time to spare. Except today. \n \n Once it was dark, the lights would come on. Then the swarm would begin. Trampling death across the land. Abating into slumber and giving him and his family a chance to look for enough calories to make it another day, hoping that something would change. Hoping every morning that *something* would improve and make life a little more bearable. He had given into blind hope when he tried to get the food. In the instant before the trap went off, he had visions of a better time. At least for a day or two his family could feed well enough to forget the world surrounding them now. But the instant he reached for the food he sensed his utter, and complete folly. His utter failure to his family. Himself. All those that came before him, and after. \n \n When he did n't die right away; his reflexes saving him from utter and complete oblivion; his childish hope came back.

The beast paused and watched him as his broken leg pawed at the air now, unbearable pain in him that was dulled to mere background noise by a new and imminent fear that fell over him. \n \n The beast was king now. The beast would decide his fate. It grimaced with contempt. Once side of it's face raised in disgust. It pondered only for a heartbeat as to whether or not to live and let live.

The red lands of the foxes of Yetar, the vast Hyrisian oceans, and the occasional eruption of the mountain of Boluth'kar... A land lost. Or bought, rather. A male, unlike any I had ever seen before. Hooded figure, long, pointed nose, not unlike a Krillpor. However, he had the voice of a Prittiw, and furthermore skin the colour of the rains of Mahjie. I am not an unreasonable fellow. I myself was once a stranger, lost, far from my home in the Oort Cloud. So I offered him a drink. He took it and muttered some untranslatable language. Business went on, and when I turned back, he was gone. \n \n The next day a new male, same cloak, same height, same nose, entered. However this males voice was rougher, and his skin as dark as the Illytre skyline. He spoke in the same tongue as the first, and no one could understand him. Suddenly he drew from his cloak a machine, a small machine, made of thin paper segments. He opened his machine, searching methodically, manually, for something specific. The next word uttered from his mouth was something everyone could understand. \n \n `` Money.'' \n \n And with that he left. \n \n A third day in a row, and a third strange creature, this time a female with the gentle voice of a crooning Jefey bird, and an understanding of the tongue of the Yul'rar. Curiosity became the better of me, and despite my usual safe distance from the happenings within my inns a habit which has not helped keep me out of trouble, I had to ask. Smiling, she replied `` I am of a world far from here. A world ravaged by those who would seek to protect it, and left behind by those who would seek to love it.'' \n \n And with that she left. \n \n And so these strange beings, Grobbits, we called them, began frequenting our bar, making friends of our people. On the night of the 82nd moon, one of them looked out of the window, and they began to speak in their own native language. An excited tone infected their actions, as if they had found what they were looking for. For you see, on the night of the 82nd moon, a vast cosmic entity known simply as Gro'ert emerges, until the day of the 7th sun. I spoke to the female who's name was'Lara', asking what all the fuss was about. Smiling the smile she had so many moons ago, she replied, `` this is our new home.'' The creatures who had been drinking here for years were, unsurprisingly, surprised. \n \n `` You would claim the land of Gro'ert as your own? The holy land of the One? You would commit sacrilege to the land of our fathers and our Gods?'' \n \n She shrugged. `` We payed a damn lot of money for it.'' \n \n And so over the coming turns of the many Suns of Gro'ert, the strange creatures, the Grobbits, flew, small groups at a time, to the holy land of our fathers. This was many half-lives ago, and since then many have forgotten the pale stranger with the voice of the Prittiw. But not I. For that man was a killer of dreams, and a pillager of hope. Drowning free will, imposing his views and torturing the minds of the many. For this whole time, I've known what that man was. A race feared by name, but not by appearance. A manipulator of words and thoughts, a destroyer of planets. From a planet known simply as'Terra Firma'.\n"}

After last time, they'll whip you for sure.'' \n \n I ignored Lis, she always worried. I carefully tapped the garnet's out of my rank insignia, green glass replacements waiting on the table. I was several terms away from even hoping to attain jade rank, the lowest required to enter the bastion of the Templar. The knights were the left arm of the king, reaching out to maintain law and order across the land. I wanted so badly to be one, like our father. It was the only way I knew that I'd for sure be able to find him, to find out where he'd been sent, and why he had n't returned. \n \n `` Jase, I'm serious. They always catch counterfeiters, there's no way you'll pass for jade rank.'' \n \n `` Leave off, Lis. I have to do this.'' \n \n `` No, you do n't. There's no good reason to risk a whipping, not even for your twice damned curiosity. You're as good as done the second you enter the temple.'' I'd been whipped before, for theft. And'irredeemable violation of curfew'. The end result was that I was smarter and better and not getting caught. \n \n `` I just want to know what's in there, that's all. A quick peek, in and out.'' The temple was a massive structure with its own gates with which to leave the city. Templars had the privilege of Movement, able to pass unrestricted where they please. \n \n `` They might brand you.'' The fear in her voice was real. The thought gave me pause. Branding would be a problem. A whipping can always be explained away, it was used for any number of public punishments. A branding, though.. `` They'll put you over the Stone, and you'll never study here again. What would Momma think?'' \n \n `` She would n't think anything, she's dead.'' She'd died six years ago, of outland fever. As our father was a knight, we were turned over to the state, to be cared for until he returned. Six years without a father, six years of bullies and taunts and scraps and leavings. Six years of sour faced hall governesses, boring lectures on manners and timeliness, not to mention tardiness. I hated it here, amid this neverending game of stones. \n \n `` You know what I mean! If you're going to sneak in, sneak in, but do n't do this! Please. For me.'' I looked up at her, saw the fear, the worry. She was two years my senior, and she'd always looked out for me. She was pretty, in her own way, not beautiful, but certainly not homely. Unique. She would enter the Medico this year, at the end of term. She loved to help people. Stones, she got enough practice on me. `` Promise me. Promise me you'll never swap your stones. It's important.'' \n \n `` Why?'' Two years ahead of me, she held a topaz rank. \n \n `` It just is.'' Her eyebrows knotted in consternation. `` Promise. Or I'll go to our Chancellor right now. You put us both at risk with your stunts.'' If the knights were the right arm, the sword arm, the Chancellory was the left, the shield: the diplomatic corps. The Chancellory had several divisions, devoted to various functions to maintain the kingdom. We, unhappily, fell under spindly-armed authority of Procknow, the Chancellor of the University. He and I were on a first name basis, playing a game of chess that spanned the breadth of the university, our moves hidden from each other, the stakes more real than little wooden pawns in the park. \n \n `` Convince me.'' Her eyes hardened, at that. She was really getting angry with me. \n \n `` I should n't have to.'' She was right, I was being completely unfair and stubborn, and we both knew it. \n \n `` Well, you do. Convince me. I want to know what goes on in there. You wo n't tell me, so I'll go see for myself.'' She looked at me and said nothing. Frustrated with my lack of results, I scooped up my damaged rank insignia and pinned it on my shirt. I scooped up my hooded cloak and threw it about my shoulders, and took a step toward the door. I glanced over my shoulder at her. `` Last chance.'' \n \n She stared daggers at me, but said nothing. \n \n I turned and reached for the doorhandle. Her whispered voice was all I heard before my brain reported that my legs had suddenly gone missing, and I slammed my head on the door as gravity took charge of this evening's itinerary. \n \n -- - \n \n I woke to a bright room, my back a mass of knots, my head a blazing fury of pain that eclipsed even my most savage hangovers. I tried to sat up, promptly regretted it, and laid back down, my hands to me eyes to quell the pain. \n \n `` Lis. Tend to your brother.'' I tried to open my eyes, but the lancing pain it brought was too much. I knew that voice. This was n't good. \n \n `` I warned you,'' she muttered, touching her fingers lightly to my temples. `` *Ana therae, thorixa don, sheddeth*,'' I heard her whisper. Coolness spread across my forehead and the pain receded like dawnshadow. `` Sit up.'' Her voice was flat, almost cold. I complied, opening my eyes. What had she done? I lay on a massive stone table in the Medico, the gleaming white basins, linen racks and pearly white lanterns a familiar sight. I'd been here before, for stitches and other wounds, usually from fighting, sometimes for falling from heights I should n't have been on, that were then blamed on alleged fights with opponents that my alleged honor forbid me from naming. Chancellor Procknow stood across the room, hands clasped behind his back, his expression more dour than normal. `` Well good evening, your Gloominess. What brings you to the Medico?'' \n \n The instant my glib tongue began flapping, I realized my error. Normally, Procknow and I would spar a little, dance around my latest indiscretion, a merry tryst between truth and consequence, followed by punishment, more punishment, and sometimes remorse. This would not be one of those times. Today, the game we had played for the past handful of years ended, and I lost. Procknow's eyes went flat, I could hear the air whistling through his narrow nose as he inhaled sharply and drew himself to the peak of his spindly height. On his chest, the diamond rank insignia of a Chancellor winked black, as if robbed of its sparkle. I'd never seen such a thing before. My sister apparently had, because she skipped back away from me, her eyes full and wet. She was afraid for me? For the first time in my adolescence, I felt real, honest fear. \n \n `` *Silence*,'' he commanded, in the barest of whispers, a fugitive word escaping clenched teeth. The sound struck me in the spine and reverberated through my person, undeniable, overwhelmingly powerful. I had never heard its like, in practice or in rumor. What madness was this? I must have blinked, or swooned with wooziness, as he was suddenly across the room, in my face, smothering me with a presence that belied his obvious anorexia. `` You place us all in a precarious position with your antics. To stop your endless childishness, to protect this kingdom, your sister nearly broke her oaths. Had you succeeded in entering the temple, you risked not only your own trip to the Stone, but hers as well. Because she stopped you, because she held true to her oath, you are both saved.'' Behind me, her quiet sobs broke my heart. I had failed, unredeemably. `` But, as she drew from the stones to stop you, you have drawn the attention of others, and you are no longer my problem.'' I've been a little afraid of Procknow before, and had mostly grown out of it. The fact that he was smiling at me filled me with horror I'd never known. Drew from the stones? What had she done? My eyes went to her topaz rankstones, which lay black against her blouse. \n \n He stepped back and smoothed his robes with a practiced, habitual gesture, his diamond rank pin twinkling again in the light. `` Your sister will not be punished for your indiscretion. She will advance to the Medico as befits her rank and accomplishments. But given the situation, her commencement is immediate, as is yours. You are summarily dismissed from the University, as befits *your* rank and accomplishments, and I happily turn you over to your new instructor.'' New instructor? Another school? I looked back to Lis for help, but she was n't looking at me. She was looking past me, tears rolling down her face, her expression a mask, unreadable. \n \n I followed her eyes, and twisted where I sat to see what held her gaze. \n \n Father. Gone was his resplendent Templar mail that I'd helped him clean as a child. The greatsword that once hung at his belt was missing, earned through spectacular combat trials while I cheered and Mother pretended not to watch. An old scar that I'd never seen crossed from his cheek under his jawline, lending an air of menace to the handsome lines of his face. His hair was shorn short, any less and he'd pass for a monk. He wore no metal at all that I could see, bound head to toe in linen, woolens, and leather, stained an ashen, ununiform gray. Where were his emerald rankstones? Why, he wore no rank at all! Over his back, a wooden handle peeked above the lines of his shoulder, telling the tale of a weapon too heavy to swing from a belt. What was heavier than his greatsword? He stepped forward and I soon found out: A massive stone hammer, tight leather bindings wrapped around an incredibly large head, seemingly the largest onyx I had ever seen. I tore my eyes from the hammer to meet a gaze that cut me to my core. \n \n `` Father?'' It was the only word I could find to utter, my shock was so complete. \n \n His response threatened to unhinge my jaw and launched me from my seat. The world sparked and spun and lurched and fell unceremoniously to the hard marble floor. Consciousness whirled around me, dancing a merry jig. \n \n `` My apologies, Chancellor, for my child's behaviour. The fault is clearly mine.'' I heard a whisper of clothing, felt a vise of what must be good, Kingdom-forged steel clamp around my ankle, and a pathetic squealing from various bits of exposed skin as my father dragged me across the floor. Somewhere in the distance, my sister wept. \n \n -- - \n \n I awoke sometime later in a forest clearing, naked. At my feet, a small wisp of paper was tied to an equally small onyx dagger. \n \n `` Look north. Go to the top. Do not fail.'' \n \n A mountain peak. \n \n Great.\n"}

His skin was n't quite so red as I imagined and he actually looked quite handsome in his pressed black suit, red striped tie. His horns were n't so menacing and his pronged tail curled around his leg rather shyly. \n \n `` I... uh, I did n't know you felt this way,'' He started, his eyes to the floor. I think his cheeks even began to blush. \n \n `` I... I do n't know what this is about,'' I said, dumbfounded. \n \n `` The Facebook thing, you ignored God and basically said you loved me?'' There was a profound hope in the Devil's eyes, but I could also see the deep-set fear lingering beside his red irises. \n \n `` That?'' I tried to remember what I had actually paid attention to scrolling through the news feed. `` I did n't really pay that much mind.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' The Devil said. He gulped and brushed his foot on my doormat anxiously. He whispered nearly inaudibly, `` Another false alarm.'' His voice cracked and I felt he was close to crying. He turned to leave. \n \n I grabbed his arm. `` Please, come in. You came all the way here from Hell and you even brought such pretty flowers. The least I can do is offer you something to drink.'' \n \n `` Sure!'' He said enthusiastically, his broad smile a testament to his excitement. \n \n `` Sorry the place is a mess, if I knew you were coming by I might have cleaned up a bit,'' I said nonchalantly as we walked to the living room. I motioned for him to take a seat on the couch. \n \n `` The place looks great. Homey. Cozy. So much unlike... you know.'' \n \n `` What do you want? I've got milk, soda, juice...'' \n \n `` Vodka.''

I poured two small glasses so as to not have to get up later. \n \n I returned to the living room and sat in an armchair across from the couch. The Devil was a peculiar sight.

You will make me feel uncomfortable being so poorly dressed.'' I motioned to my grey sweatpants and white tank top. \n \n `` If you say so,'' The Devil took off his jacket, but offered nothing else to the conversation. \n \n `` So... does this happen to you a lot?'' I asked, swirling around my drink, taking care not to go overboard. \n \n `` Oh yes, all the time.'' He took his glass and swallowed the entire volume in a single gulp. `` God thought it would be a clever trick to play on me, considering nobody ever looks at those fucking things, but I have to show up, you know? What if that one person, they are the one? What if, finally, someone can accept me?'' \n \n `` I feel ya,'' I replied, pushing my drink over to him. He needed it. \n \n `` God is an asshole. He gets to drown thousands of people in a flood and destroy the world and still be the'good guy'. I wage a rebellion for equal rights for all angels and get branded the root of all evil. HE created me, HE is the root of evil.'' \n \n `` Wait, equal rights? Really? That sounds progressive.'' \n \n `` God had his jocks, the angels that played divine baseball and divine football, and they all toyed around with the pencil pushers like me that made sure the world did n't fall apart.'' \n \n `` Is there no one in Hell you can... uh, connect with?'' Did fallen angels still have sex? \n \n `` All of the men and women in Hell are rotten souls. I only started doing bad things because that is what everyone expected of me.

One of his horns poked me in the eye. `` Dammit,'' I groaned. He could heal any wound, but it still hurt. `` You need to wear the horn protectors,'' I reminded him. Three years of this shit. Yet I could n't imagine a day without him. \n \n `` Sorry,'' He mumbled, and I knew he meant it. \n \n `` It's alright,'' I returned, curling up a little closer and sighed. `` God does n't know what He's missing,''\n"}

Eyes closed, he listened, carefully, for the minutiae in the massive. \n \n At the base of the sound was a soft thrum. A constant, ceaseless thing that beat against the world with the weary pressing of a tide. It underlined the sounds that hovered above it. It highlighted them. They were, in all their eclecticism, everything and nothing. The faint ticking of a clock somewhere far off. The shuffling of slipper-padded feet against polished tile. The vague sound of construction work outside, dulled by the windows. Noel experienced them all.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Nothing went as planned . Your partner 's in critical condition , the Eskimo is on the loose , and Smokey Joe 's Taco Joint still stands .\n","story":"`` Shit shit shit. Shit.'' Lucas paced back and forth. The plan failed horribly and there was no way to salvage another one. He looked at the door, only able to hear faint footsteps beyond the beeping of the many monitors and machines in the sterile darkened room. He looked back to Michelle, his fiance. This was n't her fault and yet she was in trouble because of him. Lucas leaned over and kissed her forehead before he could n't wait for the doctor or nurse any longer. The man quickly left and pulled out his cell phone to see if his friend, David knew where that damned Eskimo had run off to. \n \n `` Sir, no cell phones allowed-'' A blond nurse began to say. \n \n `` Have you ever lost an Eskimo, lady!?'' He snapped and looked up, face all too serious. `` He's probably confused and scared. It's like 100 degrees out there. Do you think he's gon na be in good shape huh?'' He saw no new messages or missed calls and just jogged down the hall to the elevator and pressed the button several times. His palms were sweaty and his heart rate was racing. The plan was to sabotage Smokey Joe's Taco Joint so that his own taco truck could take over the turf. He knew a friend up in Alaska who could send someone down to take some smack about the joint, the Eskimo named Aujaq, was going to pretend to be some old expert who knew the proper way to cook and prepare fish. Aujaq was going to make sure everyone knew that Smokey Joe's was a rip off. \n \n But sadly when it came time to plan the Eskimo, the guy got distracted and wandered off. So of course Michelle being the angel that she was, went to go track him down. On the boardwalk, Aujaq wound up near a stand selling fried food. When he bite into his fried twinkie, it burned his mouth, he stumbled back and knocked it over. Lucas did n't know all the damned details but somehow his fiance ended up getting hit by a vat filed with hot oil. She was rushed to the hospital and the Eskimo ran off while his rival continued to get more and more customers. \n \n It was insane. \n \n Finally in the hospital parking lot, Lucas found a cab and rode back to the boardwalk and began to look for the man who was thousands of miles from his home. `` Aujaq!'' He called out. Several tourists looked at him but Lucas paid no mind. `` Michelle is gon na be fine!'' He called out, though he really was n't sure. He just needed to find the guy and make sure he was okay too. He felt guilty, foolish and a little bit hungry due to the strong aroma of fried dough in the sea breeze air. After twenty minutes David met up with him and as they made their fifth way around the beach front, they saw the Eskimo standing by Smokey Joe's Taco Joint, biting into a fish taco. `` Guess our plan is a bust.'' David patted his friend on the back. `` Sorry.'' \n \n `` Nah, it was n't going to work anyway... I still lost thousands of dollars with the plane ticket and-'' \n \n Suddenly Aujaq started to cough and choke and threw down the taco. The man behind the counter, dick face Joe asked if he was alright. The Eskimo shook his head and began speaking in another language. A crowd began to form and David and Lucas made sure they were n't seen by Joe. Aujaq pointed his finger at Joe and declared, `` You sully the fish's life by mistreating it and wasting it.'' He frowned, finger trembling. `` You are a disgrace to your ancestors.'' He continued. `` You pile on horrible processed foods and flavors and then you take these people's money to fund your continued crimes against nature.'' He shook his head and looked down at the pile of taco at his feet. `` You have no respect for the food you serve nor the people you serve.'' \n \n Then he walked away and David hurried after him while Lucas took a second to smirk before going to catch up with the others. The three then went back to the hospital in David's old red Volvo while they continued to praise what Aujaq had done for them. `` Thanks again, I'm sure I'll be able to set up shop in no time at all.'' Lucas laughed as they arrived at the sixth floor where Michelle was. `` Tonight I'm gon na make a big dinner for you, man.'' As they walked down the hall, voices quieting down, the nurse from before looked up from her computer and had to do a double take. \n \n `` So you found your Eskimo.'' She said in disbelief. `` Is he alright?'' \n \n `` He's cool.'' David laughed as they headed into Michelle's room to see how her second degree burns were doing and what the damage was. The doctors said she could have been a lot worse and that it would take a few weeks and special treatment before she could start to feel well enough to go home. Lucas kissed her and that night, the four of them ate in her hospital room while they swapped stories and watched the local news, many people talking about the Eskimo. `` You should do an interview.'' David said as they wrapped up. The Eskimo shook his head and said he would be leaving soon. Lucas was just happy for the help and turned to his friend who would be helping him on the food truck. \n \n `` We'll name it Aujaq and the Taco Truck.'' Lucas said. \n \n The other three just shook their heads as the night faded onward, their crazy plan somehow having worked after all.\n"}

This was completely...'' \n \n `` Go on,'' he urged. The lawyer nodded, trying to remember. \n \n `` It started just a few months after.... I actually do n't know, now that I think of it.

Because out of the blue, we met someone so.....'' \n \n -- -- -- \n ** [?? \/??, Courtroom No. 2 ] ** \n \n We were in the middle of the trial. I do n't remember what exactly the case was, though. Fancy that, but it was not the first time I went into a courtroom totally empty-handed. Besides, I did have my trusty co-counsel to back me up, right? \n \n Wrong. \n \n For some reason, neither one of them had showed up at the lobby today. And to make matters worse, I had no evidence, no case outline, no nothing except my badge! What could I do when the bailiff called me in? Chicken out? It would be a great disappointment for my client... Whoever my client was. \n \n When the Judge asked me if I was ready, all I could do was stand there and sweat. Seriously, I have n't even seen the defendant before in my life! Some... generic person, now that I think about it. Quite an outstanding one against all the other clients that I took before. \n \n Of course I said I was ready! If it was one thing I could do, it was flying by the seat of my pants. Well, at least, it worked for me before, it could work for me again. I hope. \n \n And then... \n \n The doors burst open. In strode this... This girl, manila folder in her hand, and she plonked herself right down beside me and shot me a smile. \n \n `` Just in the Nick of time, eh?'' she said. Her smile was bright, the pun even cheered me up a bit, somehow. That did n't make sense. `` I brought all the evidence you'll need, so take a look before you start, okay?'' \n \n I nodded, taking the records from her. Let's see... Crime scene diagrams and photos, murder weapon, fingerprint analysis, random bits of evidence that might come in handy later... Yep. It was all there. But the case outline was fuzzy, like someone dropped it in water and the ink bled everywhere. \n \n Even before I could ask who she was or what happened to the outline, she had gone on and hauled the first witness up for cross-examination. Got to give her points for the enthusiasm, but.... Was n't that a little *too* much? \n \n Yet she grilled the poor soul. He completely split under her unrelenting pressure and perfect presentation. I do n't get it, was she really just my co-counsel or was she the one taking the case? And well, even before the judge had to say anything, he pleaded guilty to the case and framing the defendant. All within the first day, first trial. \n \n The gavel came down, and I did n't have to do a single thing. It was quick, and it made sense. Somehow. \n Something was wrong. \n \n My co-counsel turned to me, and she had that grin again. `` How'd I do, boss?'' \n \n `` Fantastic!'' I heard myself say. Yeah, it was fantastic, a little too fantastic. `` You should be our new employee, right?'' \n \n `` Yep! My name's Marianne Cantabella! Nice to finally meet you, Mr. Wright!'' She was so upbeat, so sunny. Kinda' like Athena, but better. Hang on, what? \n \n `` You handled that case like a pro, Marianne. If I did n't know better, I'd promote you to the head of the Agency already.'' Hey, hey! Wait! Why did I say that? She was new, she had to climb the ladder herself, and why of all people was I telling her that? But she was happy about it. It could n't have been too bad. \n \n `` I get to be the head of the Agency?'' she squealed. Oh god. She was Lettie two-point-oh. \n \n `` Yeah, why not? Might as well have someone else boss the other two around for me.'' *What?! * Oh, Apollo and Athena are going to be so, so mad... \n \n `` Great! I'll meet you back at the office, I've got to go talk to the Chief Prosecutor about tomorrow's case, he's gon na give me all the evidence the detectives have so we wo n't run into any trouble tomorrow. Maybe you can bring Apollo or Trucy out for noodles instead? Well, I'll see you later, boss!'' \n \n `` See.... You.'' She dashed out the door, leaving behind this sparkly mist in her wake. Was it perfume? I do n't know, it smelled pretty nice. Edgeworth would like her a lot, just like I did. Hey, wait a sec. Edgeworth was the last person to be handing out evidence like aquarium flyers. But he'd do it for Marianne, right? \n \n No, no. This was too odd. I called up Apollo back at the office while I cleared the table. He sounded cheerful too, and it was n't the usual empty cheer for once. *Empty cheer? * He asked about Marianne's first day, and gushed *gushed! * about how she was so happy-go-lucky, she managed to clear his spirits about Clay with just a pep talk! And as a side note, he told me that Athena somehow did n't report to work today, because she was'sick or something'. And Trucy was trying out the new magic tricks that Marianne taught her before she came for the trial. \n I slammed down the phone. This surely could not be happening. I've certainly had enough of scripts and stories since Labyrinthia, but.... \n \n Labyrinthia?! \n \n I... I was in a story again, was n't I. \n \n I went to look for Athena after the trial. Her house was empty and her phone was turned off. I called Juniper. She had no idea where Athena went. Neither did Simon nor Aura know. It was like she was just gone. Disappeared. Off the face of the earth. \n \n But I'm in a story, right? All I have to do is find her. She had to be somewhere! Just... where? Did Marianne do something to her? She could n't have just disappeared into thin air! So I went back to check her house again. \n \n That's when... That's when I saw her. \n \n She was barely there, stuffed under her own bed and bleeding everywhere. I called the hospital, and she told me... She told me that Marianne did it to her. \n \n..... \n \n That was not the worst part of it though. When I went back to the office to ask Marianne about it, well... \n \n -- -- -- \n \n `` That would explain everything, Wright. Just a question though.'' \n \n The distraught lawyer sat on the opposite side of the glass, head in his hands. `` What?'' came the mumble. \n The Chief Prosecutor sighed. The red hand print on his cheek was still tingling. \n \n `` Why did you slap me?'' \n \n `` Edgeworth. What was I supposed to do when I walk in on an orgy happening right in my office and you trying to kiss me out of nowhere?!'' \n \n `` I do n't know, kiss me back?!'' \n \n `` You do n't....'' \n \n `` Yes.'' \n \n The lawyer leapt up with a yell, and the guards had to escort him away. Edgeworth could still hear the cries of'LET ME OUUUUUUUT!!' echoing down the hall as he left. This case was ridiculous, as expected. Athena Cykes's sudden death, Phoenix Wright framing his own employee for the deed, and Marianne Cantabella turning the case on its head while standing in the defendant's seat. \n \n He sighed. Poor Marianne. She had to put up with so much. Perhaps a little offering of flowers and tea later would help.\n"}

You would think that this line would be longer, since it's purpose was so broad, but most people came to get the same things these days. \n \n Finally, he reached the front of the line. \n \n `` Papers and registration please.

They barely even looked at the forms, just like he suspected. Coming in at the end of a shift was the right call. \n \n `` Hey are you Jack?'' \n \n `` Yeah you have the blue form?'' \n \n He handed the form over waiting for the reaction. Jack took the form and ran it through the machine, a copy of it appearing on the computer screen.

The judge took a deep breath, and opened his chapped lips. \n \n `` Craig Bronze,'' He began, `` You have been charged with over fifteen accounts of arson, what do you plead?'' \n \n The judge closed his eyes as he knew what was coming next, the long process of a court all because some piece of shit ca n't own up to what they've done. All the evidence points towards them, the best thing they can do now is just admit it and be a man. \n \n `` Guilty with pride your honor.'' \n \n The judge was shocked, never had he heard someone admit to their crimes with such confidence before, let alone actually admit to a crime this massive. \n \n `` What did you say?''

I would have gone back to sleep were it not for the suffocating feeling that something was terribly wrong. *Damn it, * I thought. *We better not be getting robbed. * The roommates were still out of town and since they left the sounds of our townhouse settling was creeping me out, and my paranoia kept me on edge. \n \n I got up form my futon and grabbed my bowie knife from my nightstand. I crept silently towards my door and tried to open it silently. *Creeeaaak! * `` Fuck...'' I whispered. Hoping my potential assailants did n't hear it, I peered down the dark hallway outside my room. I turned the lights on and saw nothing. I began walking ever so slowly towards the stairs and when I made it I looked up and saw nothing but darkness. \n \n I was not comfortable going up the stairs, because any burglars could catch me offguard from the banister that caressed the side of the stairs at the top. I made it to the top and, again, found nothing when I turned on the lights. I felt pretty silly, wearing nothing but my underwear, hunched over, and holding a bowie knife at three in the morning. \n \n I decided to just check the windows and then go back to bed. I walked up to our windows in the living room and, convinced nothing was out of the ordinary, threw the curtains open. What I saw surprised me; It was my own face. I was wearing nothing but boxer shorts, holding a bowie knife, and one eye was more open than the other. I had forgotten to turn the light off, so I could n't see outside. \n \n I went back to the lightswitch, flipped it, and started back to the windows. I stopped as soon as I could see outside. Illuminated by the streetlights were nine hooded figures. I would have cursed if I was n't in shock. I backed up slowly and sat back on the floor. The silence was even worse now. *Maybe I'm just seeing things, maybe it's just-* **BANG! BANG! BANG! ** They were trying to knock my door in.

A fourth said. `` What?'' `` The lights are on.'' `` Oh shit!'' `` Fuck!'' `` He knows!'' `` My parents are gon na kill me!'' `` He's alone.

Tim walked to the kitchen and the others followed. \n \n `` *Let's go, motherfuckers! *'' shouted a voice from the living room. \n \n `` OH MY GOD!'' screamed the ones in the back as they ran forward. \n \n A naked man holding two huge knives sprinted into the kitchen with a battlecry. \n \n `` I'LL FUCKING KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF- Oh shit.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Years ago a curse was cast that all people wearing costumes would turn into real versions of the costumes . This is now an annual , known and accepted phenomenon .\n","story":"When the Great Garbing came into existence, they say it changed our world. It only happens one day out of the year, but it let the world know magic existed. They say one angry witch cast the spell, and she just so happened to be rather strong in her magic skills. At first, scientists and technologists scrambled for ways to fix it but after several years, the people learned to love it and the search ended. A new wave of enthusiasts rose, and festivals were soon put together. People broke into niches for their favorite things or other causes. \n \n \n There were the `` Cosplayettes,'' who loved to dress up as their favorite fantasy idols from books or TV. They were the first to rise up in support of the Great Garbing day, and derived themselves from my grandmother's old fashioned ideas of `` cosplayers.'' The `` Jobbists'' took on their dream profession for a day or committed to a profession in need for a day to help the world. The `` CopyCats'' would take on other real life people as their garb, sometimes as people who had passed on to give another person peace with their departed loved one, or switch with friends for a day. Therapists even recommended this as a kind of therapy to promote understanding between couples, families, and friends to respect each other's difficulties through experiencing them. The last large group was the `` Chimeras'' and they prided themselves on becoming things we'd never seen before. There were other groups with different purposes, but they were all much smaller. \n \n \n I had always considered myself a `` floater,'' a person who had never settled themselves to one group for the Great Garbing. Floaters were often thought to be lazy, uncreative, and unskilled. In my case, I was unskilled, but I had plenty of dream plans, and I worked my ass off to try and make them happen. The problem I had is that all the classes in the world were n't paying off fast enough. I'd get a little better each year, but never quite make it happen. The Great Garbing had a fair few rules. For one, the more detailed and intricate your costume, the more you actually became like your costume. If you used a real dentist's jacket, and had real tools from a dental office, you could turn into a skilled dentist, and perform professionally. That's why `` Jobbists'' actually managed to often get their costumes funded by the government, or companies seeking a specific profession for the day. If you were like the Chimeras, and you made your costumes up from odds and ends, things would act in character to how they were made. If you gave yourself tentacles, they'd perform like tentacles. The downside is that if you poorly crafted your wings, or you made them like ostrich wings, not only could you not fly, they may look wonky. \n \n \n Professional crafters had popped up everywhere, and now it was a dream job. Once, it had been my dream too. I worked mediocre jobs between Great Garbing days, and scrounged every penny I could to take classes for anything that might help me become a better crafter. Each year though, my confidence was daunted when my Great Garbing would come to some kind of bitter end and disappointment. I had had my fair share of bullying from classmates and if it was n't that, it was my own mental talk bullying me for my failures. One year, I tried to become a spring fairy. I even used fresh flowers, real dirt, and giant elephant ears to form a dress. I worked all year on perfecting my wings, using actual tree branches and other natural materials. I even ordered top-shelf spider silk to web the wings in. When I woke up at midnight though, intent to spread some love to the nearby community garden, I found that my wings failed to work, from my inability to weave the web tight enough. I had planned to fly from my roof, without testing them... I broke my arm that year. \n \n \n Since then, my family has questioned and shadowed my costumes every year. This year, I kept my plans top-secret. My mom had taken to chastising me in attempt to garner information, but I held my resolve this year, determined to finally be an independent adult. I say independent, but I live at home still. My costume had been coming along swimmingly, and I was more than proud, I was thrilled. For the first time in years, I felt confident that this would be the attempt I'd waited for. \n \n \n I pulled the dark robes over my head, lacing the bodice up tight. This year, I'd even embroidered the dress myself, and the violet thread against the dark as coal fabric had turned out amazing. The matching cloak had a real heavy silver clasp, decorative and ornate, with a rune symbol imprinted in it that I had designed myself. Granted, I had no idea if it would work like I wanted it too, but something felt right. I'd even made a very expensive trip to the Ensemble Woods this year, where people went to lay their old costumes because they believed that was where the witch had cast her spell. Those woods seemed magical the time I stayed in them, wildlife there was vibrant and friendly, everything seemed so peaceful and sounds were melodic to me. I could n't understand how anyone ever found the deep woods to be scary there, or how stories of rabid wildlife came to be, and seeing the old costumes that had served people well gave a sense of pride in my people to turn what should have been a bad thing into good. \n \n \n I crafted a wand out of an odd tree I'd found deep in the woods. It was a dark wood, but where the wood formed gnarls it shifted to a very light wood. The leaves it produced were heart-shaped. Well most of them were, but some looked like they'd only half-formed, making half a heart. The wand I had shaped with my pocket knife and a few tools I'd taken from a woodwork class, turned out beautiful, with swirls of light wood, and a single heart shape leaf I'd left attached to it, and I had left it rather long in shape. It was the last piece I needed of my costume, and I had saved it til last intentionally. I would fall asleep in the Ensemble Woods, and awaken as the witch who had started this all and then, I would end the Great Garbing once and for all. \n \n \n When I did awake, I could feel it. The power I had once had returned. How long had I lost myself inside that alternate mind of a weak and timid girl? I stood and walked a while, seeking the edge of the forest, I needed to know what the people had done since my curse had hit them. As I crossed by a stream I caught the sparkle of my violet eyes in a pool of water, I smirked happy to be rid of the dull and bleak blue eyes I had lived with so long. I reached the edge of my woods, and found an abundance of costumes laid out along branches, and posted to trees. Some had notes attached to them, and others showed wear and tear from their Garbing day. I walked over to a Doctor's scrubs, soaked in blood, a note clipped on the pocket reading, `` Today, I saved a toddler and her mother who arrived at the struggling Harbor Med center. A drunk driver nearly stole their lives away, but through the Great Garbing, I managed to keep them both here with us. May they see many more Great Garbings. Thank You, Lady Ensemble.'' I walked around to more costumes, finding similar notes. \n \n \n The clattering of a tambourine met my ears, and I turned to see a group approaching, but they stopped at sight of me. There were musicians, and children dressed as small fae, artists carrying sketchbooks, and cooks bringing food, and all kinds of people behind them. The crowd murmured among themselves, and finally a well-dressed guard stepped forward. \n \n \n `` Who are you supposed to be?'' he asked, albeit warily. \n \n \n I ignored his question, `` What are you all doing in my woods?'' I spat back. \n \n \n The crowd began murmuring again, and before I knew it they all settled onto their knees, heads bowed and hands crossed over their laps. \n \n \n The guard lifted his head to answer me, `` We came again this year to thank you, Lady Ensemble.'' \n \n \n I returned to myself to take away the curse, bitter over the fact they had started to enjoy it more than hate it. When I placed it on them, it was because I was upset with the world. I was angry with the politicians who argued as if they had the people's best interest at hand, while secretly progressing their own personal motives. I was infuriated at the selfishness of doctors and business men, who walked past the homeless people on the daily, while spouting how they took the job they had to help others, and hoarded money. I felt anguish to watch the new generation growing up hopeless, paying fortunes they did n't have to underfunded schools, with under trained staff, to come out with a degree that brought them nowhere in life. I was sad to see the human race could n't even agree with having different colors of skin, and my own race and other magical races could n't even leave our hiding for fear we'd be treated even worse than humanity treated their own kind, let alone some of the other animals that inhabited their earth. For the leaders of this world, they were terrible to everything, from the nature that gave them sustenance to their own kind that shared minor differences. \n \n \n Once a year, they even dressed up for fun, as all kinds of things. I thought if I made them have to live as those things once a year they might gain an understanding for one another. When they began to lose their shock, and made what I thought was a game of it, my rage grew. I had used every ounce of my power for this lesson, and they mocked me from what I saw through the haze using so much power had left me in. It was n't until this moment that I realized they had found the compassion I'd wanted them to have and it had made them joyful. It was not perfect, but they appreciated the Great Garbing, and more importantly, they were coming to appreciate themselves and those around them. So I retired my tirade that day and drew on the cloth of humanity, it was time I learned my own lesson, without the haze.\n"}

Would n't want some foolish rookie guard to ruin my plans for this world because I was careless. The clinking of my blackened armour as I shifted through debris was the only sound that could be heard in the village itself. It was almost sad how easy it was to cause so much destruction. I even began to feel a little sorry, then my eyes focused on **them**. Those damned blackened hands, running with fissures, filled with the unholy flames that gave me my power. They did this to me! They deserved this! **I even helped give them this world, yet they did thi-** A sudden thud wrenched me back to the present. In the following moment of clarity, I came to realise the thud was my own clenched fist hitting the soil. I cursed myself for being so foolish, and losing my temper. Slowly, I raised my hand, only for my body to freeze in place. \n \n Before me lay a small red flower. Its petals mostly obscured by soot, and its stem flattened. So delicate, as per my design. A somewhat guilty pleasure. It forced me to think back to better times. Times best left forgotten. The people were quick enough to forget. I shook my head and cursed myself under my breath, such sentiment would get me nowhere. It certainly would n't get me what I want. My body felt heavy, unnaturally so, like a weight was bearing down on my back as I rose to my feet. There was only silence, just like before, yet something seemed different now. Where were the cries of the villagers who ran? Surely they had n't gotten too far already? \n \n A high pitched wail pierced through the air, followed by a sudden thunk right in my ear. I stared at the floor as a rock fell to the ground. Leaning down, I grasped it in my hand, my eyes scanning my surroundings for the one who would dare to toss a stone at me, and I found him. A boy. Not even a young adult. A child. He tore his gaze from me guiltily as I returned to my full height, my eyes locked onto him. He had the look of a child being scorned for stealing a treat, not striking out at a god! \n `` Look at me, child.'' \n He refused, as rebellious children oft do. I gave him a moment, eyes aflame. I would teach this boy a lesson. \n `` Do n't suddenly get scared, boy! Look the man you struck out at in the eye.'' \n He finally returned my gaze, to see me holding out the stone he had tossed at my helm. \n `` You see this?'' \n The air grew around my hand grew warm as the flames within the cracks of my flesh roared and began to billow. The stone crumbled slightly before turning to ash and being carried off by the breeze. \n `` I could do that to the stone. I did it to your village. I can certainly do that to you, insolent child. Do you even know who I am?'' \n The boy shook his head. Of course he did n't know me. None of them know of me. Mortals forget so easily. I began to approach him, resting a hand on his shoulder once I had reached him. A voice rang out. \n `` No! Do n't hurt my boy! He knows not what he-'' \n I raised a hand to silence the woman. \n `` You are the boy's caretaker, I presume. Oh I know, he does n't know what he just did.'' I stared straight into the child's eyes and this time he stared back, defiant. `` That is why I'm going to give you a chance. Pray tell, what is your name?'' \n He stuttered, betraying the fear he was hiding rather well until that moment. \n `` M-My name is... My name is Ashton.'' \n `` Well, Ashton. Consider yourself very lucky. This was just the first time I plan to show myself. A little test to see how I'd fare. So, you are going to get one chance to make a decision. By the time I come back again, you will be a bit older. Here's what you need to do in that time, you need to learn everything you can about the one named Zur. Everything he did and everything that happened to him, and prepare yourself. If, when the time comes, you still feel brave enough to challenge me, I will give you to honour of trying. Do I make myself clear?'' \n Another little nod. \n `` Perfect. Oh and just so you do n't forget.'' \n I rolled up his sleeve and placed a palm upon his shoulder, the ever present heat searing a hand shaped mark into his flesh.

Then, when her friends asked, she said, `` Our refrigerator broke and i do n't want to give my dad a hard time because money is tight.'' They backed off. \n The pounds started dropping away and she was so excited. She knew she didnt have anorexia, but maybe if she pretended that she did, she could still lose weight. Eventually, she stopped putting butter on her eggo waffles in the morning, then the syrup, and soon enough, one stalk of celery was enough to keep her going until supper time. But she was n't anorexic, not really. She didnt count calories. She was never tired. And mainly, she was still fat. So she kept pretending. \n One day, she noticed her hair starting to fall out. Then, her nails broke. Sitting down was uncomfortable because of bones digging into her chair. Her thoughts were filled with the food that she never ate. Her friends stopped talking to her, and she stopped talking to her friends. But she was n't really anorexic, not yet. She was still too fat. \n She got frustrated. `` Why ca n't I be anorexic?! Why am i so damn fat?'' Suddenly tears started to stream down her face. She fell on to the floor of her bathroom, gawping for breath between sobs. `` Fat, fat, fat, fat...'' She felt her thighs touching each other and she felt her arms touching her chest and she felt her stomach touching the floor and knew that she had to lose more weight. She was disgusting. She was fat. She was n't worth anything. \n \n She was not that fourteen year old girl anymore. She did n't even remember who that was.

Gratefully, Amy released the clamps and fell with the hatch onto the floor of the garage. \n \n As the ice melted beneath her cheek, she caught her first breath in what had felt like days. The concrete was warm. Good; that meant it was summer, as least. The state of the remainder of the house confirmed it; she had returned only minutes after she left. \n \n Trembling, she picked up the phone and pressed the first speed-dial. On the the third ring, the tinny speaker emanated a click, and for the first time in 15 years, Amy heard her mother's voice. \n \n It was done. He was gone, he could n't hurt them anymore. Finally, all the times he had wronged them had n't just been atoned for; they had been erased. \n \n \n The following months were the best of Amy's life. Of course, her mother did n't know anything more; she could n't. She was outside of the field when the change had been made, but she could sense a change in her daughter. A sort of deep sadness that always lay beneath the surface. \n \n There was no way that Amy could explain any of it - she would sound insane - but it gnawed at her. The memories of what he had done.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Tell me about the one who got away .\n","story":"It was summer. Crowns of lush greens adorned stoic oak. The warmth of the breeze stole only the sweetest notes of perfume, soaking the senses of the men and women sat gazing at the sky. The racket of life: the cars zooming up and down Kingsway, the people charging from one destination to another, were muted. The square was peaceful. Full, but peaceful. \n \n \n \n Exams had just finished, or so I had been informed. This was not my university. I had not the intelligence to be admitted to this place, just my friend's alumni student card. Though he had graduated it still conferred him-and me- access to the library, fortunately. \n \n \n \n The LSE library was an enchanting place; I always loved to study there. Yet, it seemed eerie. People, students, would spend the majority of their day and night there, studying, eating, sleeping. From day to day, I saw the same people sat at the same tables wearing the same clothes. And every day they seemed just as focused as the last. \n \n \n \n I had never seen Sebastian. I was certain, I would have remembered. Seeing him sat there was like discovering a strange hue in familiar eyes; his presence was marked, but subtle. I was dumbfounded, instantly. His handsome face was softened by the implicit beauty of his eyes, which were curved and elliptical. Although we were both inside, his face appeared radiant, as though he were bathed in sunlight. And his hair was black, like the dull sparkle of coal behind his eyes. \n \n \n \n In that second, for a second, I stood paralysed. Part of me fell, while my sense of shame caught myself. Then, as if a higher social order had commanded my subconscious to move, I moved along. Both astutely conscious and unnerved by my stride. \n \n \n \n I spent the hour that followed replaying the scene. Upon each rewind, however, I assumed the role of a bolder, more charismatic character than the last. Eventually, after daydreaming away the better part of the afternoon, I chose action. \n \n \n \n What minuscule confidence I had was overshadowed by fear. Rejection was a hard pill to swallow, and I chugged plenty. Desperate to implement some damage control but still determined to see it through, I consulted Grindr. After all, gay guys loved meeting other guys, I reassured myself. I loafed myself for that; my complete disregard for my historically persistent distain for the hollow chit chat that facilitated uncomfortable and convenient fuck-sessions. Though, I proceeded all the same. \n \n \n \n His was the third face to the left, on the top row, and easily the most handsome guy for a mile. Having seen him in person, his photo conveyed a modesty that made him all the more attractive. Above that, was the fact that he had taken his picture in a place where I had eaten just the day before. It must be fated, I thought as I fingered my way through his profile. \n \n \n \n Overwhelmed and pessimistic I opened with a half arsed compliment that should have cost me his attention. \u201c The second picture is far better than the first \u201d, I typed. Hoping to appear interested yet unconcerned. The five or six minutes that followed seemed like an hour. \u201c What a dick \u201d, I scolded myself. Feeling foolish and disheartened I signed and dismissed my phone, but just as I returned my phone to my pocket it buzzed. \n \n \n \n \u201c Hey, \u201d it read. It was him. I had not planned this far ahead. \n \n \n \n We met outside the library. The sky was still blue. The glare of the sun \u2019 s radiance made it difficult to focus as I left the building, and Sebastian saw me long before I saw him. \u201c Hi \u201d he said. He seemed so relaxed, so in control. \n \n \n \n He was a little shorter than I imagined, though this in no way detracted from the situation. On closer inspection, his chest and shoulders were defined, but not so much as to indicate an obsession. And his skin was fair but brown: beautiful and radiant. \n \n \n \n We spoke non-stop for two hours. He told me about his course and how he came to be in the UK. He had travelled from Asia, where he had been raised. And I disclosed the same: that I was born in London, lived here my whole life and was currently preparing for my final exams. We had so much to discuss and did not feel averse to any subject. At some point, while we were laughing about some of the crazy situations we had wound up in on Grindr Sebastian \u2019 s face fell serious. \n \n \n \u201c it \u2019 s a shame he said \u201d. \n \n \n \n \u201c What do you mean? \u201d I replied. \n \n \n \n \u201c I fly home tomorrow. \u201d\n"}

Or maybe you \u2019 d use a synonym of some sort, something like bland, maybe even boring. I \u2019 d have to agree with you. I \u2019 ve never been exposed to the sort of life that could transform me into someone who turned heads, a diamond so bright that you couldn \u2019 t bear to look away, a jewel polished heavily that it appeared to almost be glass, ready to break on a moment \u2019 s notice. \n \n No, that was never my life. Instead I \u2019 ve lived a life of privileged, happy mediocrity, the perfect image of the virtues brought about from having an average middle class upbringing. I \u2019 ve certainly not been exempt from sadness however and as with most people in my position small instances of sadness have piled up over the years and have managed to turn me from unbearably hideous to a forgettable face in the crowd. \n \n That \u2019 s simply the status quo of my life and those I lived with, went to school with, became friends with. Growing up it was those who were exceedingly beautiful that always made you wonder, made the teacher \u2019 s worried and concerned. One instance of tragic beauty that I would never forget occurred in my final year of university, wherein one of the classmates in my homeroom class grew more and more beautiful by the day, her dirty blonde hair becoming silkier and, her eyes becoming bigger and more defined, her bodily proportions rapidly changing and creating a runway model in the short span of a few weeks. She had always been quite lovely but this sudden change from charming to absolutely gorgeous worried every one, but no one did anything. I never did anything. \n \n And then one day she stopped coming to class altogether. A few days later her body was discovered on the banks of the lake running through the city, likely pushed there by the currents. Authorities revealed soon after that all evidence pointed towards her boyfriend being the culprit, and from that tiny piece of information it became easy to decipher that in the past few months their relationship had taken a turn for the worse. It was all so obvious now in retrospect but in the moment, while it was happening, no one had taken the time to care. It was right in front of us, her ever growing beauty had been as obvious as the long sleeved shirts and ankle length pants she wore even on the hottest of summer days. The severity of her situation was not something she could truly hide and yet no one had bothered to care, even I hadn \u2019 t until it was much too late. \n \n As an adult with an atypical office job and what most would consider a promising future with various career prospects nothing much has changed for me. Bland, boring, average all still worked as very exact descriptors of my appearance, which was something I shared in common with most coworkers. Of course I felt guilty, and of course it hurt me to see those who were achingly exquisite. Watching television and reading the news provided plenty of stunning faces who held much experience within the field of tragedy. But it seems as if I never felt guilty enough, as if none of us could even begin to feel deeply enough.\n"}

He was an incredibly handsome man with a chiseled face, a five o'clock shadow at nine o'clock, a pair of smoldering hazel eyes, perfectly-styled black hair, and a roguish smirk, but it did n't make him a `` god.'' No matter how high his opinion of himself. \n \n `` And what makes you say that?'' she asked in return. He came into the bar by himself and immediately sat beside her when they'd accidentally locked eyes. Sure, he was good-looking, but she was n't looking for a guy. She was looking to forget a guy, actually. He bought them both a glass of expensive brandy and was sipping out of it like he was some sort of king. \n \n `` Well, you'd have already finished your drink by now, for starters,'' he said with a smile, `` and you would n't be giving me such a disparaging look.'' \n \n `` I'm really not in the mood,'' she replied. \n \n `` It's a bit rude to let that go to waste though,'' he replied, his smirk steady. `` Pretty rare for a god to be making an offering to a human.'' \n \n `` And just what makes you a god? Hmm?'' \n \n `` The fact that I am one.'' \n \n `` Oh? A god who wears the latest fashions with a distinctly modern haircut and barely looks older than I do?'' \n \n `` I have seen empires rise and fall. Entire worlds have burned at my command. I was old before you were born, and yet will be young when all you know is nothing but dust and ash,'' he said to me. `` Fitting in with the times is nothing new to me, and it never will be. Tomorrow these clothes will be relics in a museum but my face will still be the epitome of male perfection.'' \n \n `` Eloquent, where'd you quote it from?'' \n \n `` Nowhere, but if I am quoting something it describes my life very aptly and I've long forgotten where I'd read it.'' He swirled his brandy in his glass then finished it off. `` If you are n't going to drink it, why do n't you slide it over to me?'' She did as requested and he took a sip from the glass. \n \n `` You say you're an immortal god, but which one?'' She decided to humor him. `` Are you one I've heard of, or some minor god in a pantheon that's been long forgotten?'' \n \n `` Oh, you have heard of me. I've been called Hermes and Mercury, maybe some others I do n't recall. I may get other monikers in the future, you never know. Maybe there will be a revival of pantheistic religions.'' \n \n `` What name do you prefer?'' \n \n `` I've been going by Hermes lately. It's aged better than Mercury, and is n't the name of a planet.'' \n \n `` Good choice.'' \n \n `` I thought so too.'' \n \n `` All right, I'll entertain your little story. But if you're actually Hermes, how can you say you've had entire worlds burned at your command? Hm? I thought you were a messenger god.'' She smiled as he put down the glass. \n \n `` A little boisterous exaggeration on my part, for one. Though, to the credit of the people whose homes were burning, you could forgive them for believing it was the whole world.'' \n \n `` But, like I said, you're a messenger god.'' He feigned insult at her words. \n \n `` Just because I'm messenger god does n't mean I do n't have my crusaders! But, think of this, who was the one bringing down the words of the other gods to have their worshipers kill their enemies and whatnot? It sure was n't them.'' \n \n `` So, you mean it as a sort of technicality since you were the one who carried the orders over?'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, have you ever had someone go to war with another city because you told them someone else demanded it?'' He finished off the other glass of brandy. She was actually beginning to believe he thought he was a god of some sort. He sure talked like someone who had a notion of immortality, not that anyone with internet access could n't fake something like that easily. \n \n `` Well, if you're some god, what are you doing here then?'' His eyes widened and he immediately jumped to his feet. \n \n `` Thank you for reminding me! I actually had a delivery to make.'' He pulled an envelope from the pocket in his very nice blazer, and wagged it in the air a little. She was almost sure she saw it shimmer when he did that. `` Hera's been getting quite annoyed with Zeus for running off with Dionysus all the time to frat parties at universities. He claims they're just helping them bring the true Greek spirit, but she knows what he's up to. I'm here to hand out another of her ultimatums.'' \n \n `` Another?'' \n \n `` Oh, this happens at least twice a century,'' he informed her. `` You know, you're a pretty girl with your wits about you, let me give you a tip. Avoid the guy over in the corner.'' There were three men in the corner, and by their looks any of them could have been `` gods'' in someone's definition. \n \n `` Which one?'' \n \n `` The one with the stunningly heroic build, ridiculously attractive face, huge smile, and even bigger personality.'' Her eyes immediately picked out the one he was talking about. The man did have a certain draw to him, to the point that even the light seemed to bend to frame him with the perfect amount of illumination. \n \n `` Why, because he's Zeus?'' \n \n `` Bingo. He has a way with women that no one I know can comprehend. And it is n't from trying, because you can see where trying gets some of us.'' He shook his head, but smirked at her a little. `` I just do n't get how he does it.'' \n \n `` Well, if you're here to deliver something, why you'd stop to have a drink first? Would n't'Hera' want that letter delivered to'Zeus' to be your priority?'' \n \n `` I literally have all the time in the world,'' he responded with a chuckle. `` And honestly, having a drink with pretty girl is one of the only things that makes immortal life worth living.'' He gave her a quick smile then walked over to the man in the corner. The man's face soured when `` Hermes'' approached, and she could've sworn the sky outside lit up with lightning when it did. \n \n She was suddenly beside herself; she liked to say she was n't a girl that was easily-impressed and yet she found herself swooning just a little. He was clearly a man with an ego that could n't fit in the room, but he was carrying it fairly well. It made her regret not having that drink. But, if he was really an immortal god, there was nothing to stop him from coming back and buying her another drink. After all, like he said, he had all the time in the world. \n \n Edit: Changed all of the pronouns to be consistent.\n"}

Just kidding, but here's some constructive feedback on your story. \n \n First off, I love that this is simply a story of teenagers. It's a largely unused genre in this subreddit, so I loved that aspect about it. It's uniqueness was compounded when you explored first boyfriends\/first loves\/first times. So for that, I really loved your story. \n \n Some things that felt off: The story felt like it could have been written for a younger crowd, in terms of vocab, but the swearing and descriptive sex scene was definitely for a more mature audience. That may just be me, so take it with a grain of salt, but I had a hard time figuring out which audience this would be written for. \n \n The scene between Justine and her Mom ( when she forbade her to see Michael ) needed a little tweaking. The atmosphere is very carefree, her mother says she remembers when boys liked her like that, etc. Then she flips a switch and says she can never see him again. That's OK to have, but as a reader it felt very sudden. So much so I went back and reread it several times to make sure I did n't miss anything. A simple sentence where you describe Justine being taken surprise by her sudden change in tone would do wonders, it'd allow the reader to know that they're supposed to be surprised ( if that was the goal ). \n \n I wanted the meeting with the witch lady to play into it more. The story felt *very* strong for the first half, then kind of petered out. When Andrew was a total cock to Frankie, I was n't surprised, nor was I upset: it was very obvious. Again, that might be the goal, so take it or leave it. When it ended, it felt sudden, there did n't feel like there was a climax or rising action. \n \n I think this story would do well with more: more character development, more story, more conflict. I mean that in the best way possible: it's a great story, I just wanted more! \n \n Again, great work! Yours was by far the funniest in the group. I legitimately enjoyed it all the way through. Flesh it out and add to it and it'll be great. Thanks for the read, keep writing!\n"}

He would invariably attach himself to some movie or another, chanting the lines along with the film as he watched it, and mimicking them in the world like some autistic parrot. \n \n \n On the day after being introduced to Disney's Aladdin, he accompanied his mother to the grocery store. As they approached the entrance, he ran ahead of her and waved his hand before the doors, yelling `` OPEN SESAME!!!'' \n \n \n `` Thank you, Joshy!'' She said, giggling. She scooped him up as the glass panes slid away and placed him in the seat of the shopping cart. \n \n \n It made her laugh every time. So, he did it - at what can only be considered an annoying frequency. Even when he had moved away for college, he would do it, thinking it a universally funny gag. He would even do it for things he had trouble opening, almost as a sort of prayer. \n \n \n When she passed, there was a long while when he could n't bring himself to wave his hand and utter the words. But one day he was clearing out her room and struggling with opening a desk drawer. She had always kept it locked and damned if he did n't know where the key was. Then he did it almost without meaning to. And he found himself smiling and chuckling under his breath. \n \n \n And it opened. It did n't just unlock, it popped ever so slightly *open*. In disbelief, he tried it on everything. He locked the door and opened it with his special phrase. \n \n \n `` What are you doing?'' came a voice from behind him. \n \n \n `` Nothing!'' The word came out jumpy and defensive and the woman, Beth, eyed him suspiciously. \n \n \n Before I go on, I have to tell you what a sap this guy was for this girl. They were, without doubt, the closest of friends. They often slept in the same bed, and he would often ask her out, but her answer was always no. They'd known each other for too long, she said. Since they were young. And she could n't bring herself to feel that way about him, much as she would have liked to. So he was there for her - in the middle of the night she would call him in a panic, swearing up and down that something was going to `` get'' her. And he would rush over, lay down next to her, and comfort her until she drifted off back to sleep. He even disregarded his acceptance to Princeton in order to go to the same state university as her. He wanted to be near her always. She wanted him to be near only when she had nobody else. \n \n \n When they had finished clearing out his mother's house, he dropped Beth off at her apartment. \n \n \n `` Would you stay? Just for a bit?'' She asked, knowing he would say yes. And they went through their routine - tea and conversation, switching to pajamas, and laying down next to one another as he waited for her to sleep, then wake from a nightmare, and drift off again. \n \n \n Then a thought entered his head that he could n't shake. He set his right hand on her left breast, just over her heart, the tip of his middle finger pressing against her collar bone. It was there, in the midst of a silent darkness, he slid his hand across her chest and whispered desperately, `` open sesame.''\n"}

Like getting really high and feeling like having an out of body experience but instead of staring at *myself* myself I'm staring at... \n \n Well, I guess I'll call her Pa. \n \n A voice booms down at us from an intercom somewhere. It's a live voice, not the prerecorded kind that plays on commercials. It's a voice that I know we can talk back to - a real human sitting somewhere near enough to see us but not very near at all. Some paradox of far-but-not-far, an observer who can watch and tell me what I'm seeing and why I'm seeing it but who is unable to feel the strange sensation of dissociation and rapidly infusing morphine-induced euphoria. `` Separation complete. Meet yourselves, girls.'' \n \n `` Did you know that this was going to happen?'' Pa looks scared. She must be the good twin. Which makes me the evil one. Except I do n't feel very evil. I do n't feel like I want to go around burning things or killing people, or even hurting this strange mirror image of myself that does not mirror me. I do not look scared. I force the muscles of my face to move so that I do not look scared, rearranging each facet of my face like a piece of some puzzle until I am but a blank experimental page for the far-but-not-far owner of the voice to watch. \n \n Pa blinks at me. I have n't answered her question. I do n't plan to. She walks to the door and peers out of it, standing on her tiptoes and coming back. She sits down on the floor. She is a constant stream of motion. With every move she makes I force a bit of cement into my muscles - consciously imagining that lactic acid is filling my body from the bottom to the top, simultaneously freezing and releasing me from the need to be able to move. I am frozen - call it too much pot again - paralyzed from the high that is allowing me to see the strange hallucinations that are before me. \n \n This is n't a hallucination. I know it's not. She is the good twin and I am the evil. \n \n `` They ca n't do this to us,'' Pa is saying. She's sitting on the floor again, cross-legged, looking up at me like she should have pigtails instead of the long straight hair that hangs about her shoulders. She - I - sort of look like this manifestation of Asian-meets-Aryan, some thing that was molded from clay by a God and then throw out into the trash with that sound - *pah! * \n \n `` Please talk to me,'' Pa is standing now. Her hands are on my shoulders. She's pushing me. Somehow this contact breaks me, like I'm a glass of water and she's dipped her finger in and pressed so lightly yet just right on the surface and broken the tension and broken through to me. I almost fall into her. \n \n `` I'm here,'' the words echo in the room and do not seem to come from my mouth but they are not the words of the far-but-not-far intercom woman. Pa is sitting, saying *we need to get out of here* and I agree. \n \n `` Why did they do this to us?'' Pa is asking all of the questions that I feel I should be asking and thinking. She is the speaker and I am the thinker, apparently. Speak kind words, think the truth I suppose. It occurs to me that she is looking at me again. I wonder if there are as many thoughts in her head as there are words in my mouth. \n \n `` We need to get out of here,'' I'm just repeating her words now. Parroting them. A sick mirror of *her* now, but delayed by a few moments. A playback. A choral round, beginning to sing just as she's two syllables in, our tongues and teeth moving just the same but at different intervals. \n \n `` Pa!'' Pa shouts. It occurs to me that to Pa *I* must be Pa, and *she* must be I. It is a very confusing situation. I think of the intercom and the woman's voice and the fact that she is far-but-not-far and watching us but not close enough to be in this room with us. \n \n `` I'm here,'' it's my voice. \n \n `` We need to get out of here.'' \n \n Third time's the charm. `` How do we get out? The door is locked. I remember - we remember. Being drugged. Being dragged here. The experiments. The torture.'' \n \n `` It's horrible,'' Pa's voice is small. As if on cue the door to the room buzzes and opens on its own. I imagine the far-but-not-far woman sitting in her chair with her feet up on the table as she sips a soda, *slllllllllrp hrphrphrphrp* and watches two parts of the same girl argue. It occurs to me that this might be their plan - to release us and see what we'll do. \n \n `` We should go,'' Pa, the talker, is talking. I look at her and nod. I am tired of talking and I would rather think. I think of destroying the people who did this to me. That settles in my mind that I must be the evil twin. There are worse things to be, but it occurs to me that I'll never have my own narrative. No one ever follows the narrative of the evil twin. I am thinking of how I will spend the rest of my life being misunderstood and misinterpreted by people who look solely for good. I am thinking this way when Pa wanders out the door and looks back at me and says, `` Come on, Pa!'' and I once again remember that in her mind - if she has a mind - *she* is I and *I* am her. \n \n I follow her out. The hall is dusky. I want to ask Pa if she feels the same heaviness and dizziness. The sort of dizziness that comes from waking up in the middle of a dream that seemed too much like reality. Pa is over by the window of another door now and looking in and her mouth is slack. I go to join her, the dizziness trying to pull me down like strings tied to synapses inside my brain, little tugging pulls that remind me of looking into a flashing lightbulb and the bright red dots that continue to swim after I blink, threatening to run each time I look directly at them. Pa is looking into a room and there's a man that's strapped to a table in the room, looking directly at us but not *at* us. \n \n When I stand back I see the little sign on the door, the three triangles that come together and make me sick. That sign is n't on our door - the door we just came from - but it is strangely reminiscent of some other door. Pa looks at me and I look at Pa - we're having the same thought, except she says her out loud to me and I think it but do n't say it. That we were in that same room with those same three triangles, except maybe it was before *we* were *we* back when *we* was *I*. \n \n `` They're making superheroes,'' Pa is taking the words from my brain. But we ca n't both be superheroes. Not if one of us is good and one of us is evil. That's what they told us they were doing, back when *us* was *me* and I had the same ability to speak and think and I was n't overwhelmed by just one process. Pa is speaking aloud everything now - the triangles and the superheroes and how one of us is good and evil, though she does n't mention which she thinks she is maybe to spare my feelings on the matter, though my feelings feel fairly stoic and non-emotional about the whole thing anyway. I'm too busy trying to call back the feeling of being too high that all of this might be some dream from a drug trip far before. \n \n `` Pa,'' Pa waves her hand in front of my face like I have n't been looking at her the entire time. Her hand has those after waves, those fuzzy lights that follow, little imprints of her hand burned into my eyes. Suddenly my head hurts. Everything is coming back - memories of screaming. Of torture. Of green IVs and yellow triangles and of becoming me and her. \n \n `` Pa,'' Pa says again. `` Pa. Do n't you see what they're doing here?'' I want to say that of course I do. Of course I see. Instead I clench my hands tightly together and shut my eyes to make the pounding stop. I raise my fist and I hit it against the wall and I feel the wall crumble underneath me. I think of the man in the room with the three triangles strapped down to the table with his IV full of glowing liquid and the screams and if he will be an *us* soon, as well. I know exactly what they're doing. I know exactly what they plan to do. \n \n `` We wo n't let them,'' Pa is saying. She's taking my hand. Her hand. They are perfectly aligned, copies of a hand that should not exist. Like cupping my fingers together, sliding my own fingers up my wrist and grasping. Pa is putting her arms around me and I'm letting her even though the anger is building inside of me. But unlike what they wanted my anger is not at her. She is me and I is she. She is good and I am not. I wo n't be what they want me to be. Not to her. \n \n `` We'll do it together,'' she's saying. She's squeezing my hand. \n \n I wonder idly if there is room in the world for two superheroes who are at the same time exactly the same, and at the same time completely different. \n \n -- - \n \n Thanks for reading!

I had been the type of child to do so. \n \n \u201c Do you remember what for? \u201d I shake my head, opening my eyes to focus back down on my lap again.

The deal had been made and my soul is his. \u201c You asked me to stop the car from sinking so your mother and father would live. \u201d \n \n The car accident comes back into vivid focus and my stomach lurches.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Two men from The League of Absurd Weaponry decide to have a duel .\n","story":"`` Your weapon is quite exotic and fascinating.'' \n \n The young man looked up from polishing the blades of his weapon to see an older gentlemen. He recognized him immediately. It was Richard Headstrom - a veteran member of the League of Absurd Weaponry. The League of Absurd Weaponry was founded by his father and his friends. \n \n `` Why thank you Mr. Headstrom, it's one of my own design.'' \n \n `` What's your name? I do n't think I've seen you around here before.'' \n \n `` My name is Shawn Flayer.'' \n \n `` Well hello Mr. Flayer. Do you mind showing me what your weapon is?'' \n \n Shawn picked up his weapons. It was a pair of gloves that extended up to the forearm. The forearm portion of the gloves was larger and was made of more metal than fabric or leather. Each had four small discs with blades. The discs were attached to the gauntlets with a thin metal cable. By bending his fingers and thumb on each hand in a certain way, Shawn could cause the blades on the discs to spin or retract. He could also cause motorized spools to pull the discs towards him or let them loose so he could swing them farther away from him, up to a few metres. \n \n `` That is quite impressive Mr. Flayer, but I assure you my weapon is much more effective.'' \n \n The veteran then unsheathed a pair of swords. Each small enough to be wielded in one hand. There was a wire that led from the handles to a row of small super-capacitors on his belt. The blades could come in contact with each other to let loose an electric shock. However, the most devastating attack possible was used in conjunction with a reinforced gauntlet that was worn on Richard's right arm. The swords could be placed within the gauntlet to transform it into a small railgun. \n \n After explaining his weapon's capabilities, the veteran stood back with an air of smugness. \n \n `` Say,'' Richard said, `` why do n't we duel? Your weapon against mine?'' \n \n *** \n \n In the League of Absurd Weaponry, duels were conducted in a holodeck simulation. Weapons were scanned and combatant's would put on a helmet to connect their brain to the simulation. They could control their bodies and weapons exactly as they could in real life. This was so that weapons could be used to their fullest potential without their users being physically harmed. \n \n The arena of choice for this battle was the standard one. Over 100 metres in diameter with soft pale sand making up the arena floor. The roof was a dozen metres high to allow for aerial combat. A few stone pillars stood out of the ground at a height just tall enough so that a person could jump up and grab the top of one to pull themselves up. Richard and Shawn entered from opposite sides of the arena. \n \n The automated timer to begin counted down to zero. At that instant, Richard swiftly unsheathed his swords and attached them to his gauntlet to open the fight with blasts from his railgun towards Shawn. Shawn ran perpendicular to the attacks before shooting out a blade to the wall of the arena. He pulled himself up and began swinging along the wall of the arena towards his opponent. Richard removed his swords from his gauntlet and assumed a defensive stance. \n \n Shawn swung multiple bladed discs towards Richard. They were swiftly blocked. The blades still had momentum and as such swung back to grab the wall above and behind Richard. Richard then quickly attached his blades to his gauntlet and fired at where the blade was stuck in the wall. Shawn noticed and quickly hit the ground with a roll so as to not get too hurt. One of the blade discs on his left hand was now destroyed. \n \n Deciding that the fight was now on the ground, Shawn proceeded to unleash a trio of discs from his right hand towards Richard like whips. They were deflected away as Richard managed to grab the cable on one of them. He then let loose an electric shock that went down the cable towards Shawn. \n \n Shawn however had anticipated this and had one the discs lodged in the sand to ground himself. He then retracted the disc as he commanded the blades on it to spin. They tore through Richard's hand like a blender, staining his boots and the ground with blood while rendering his left hand useless. \n \n Unable to attach his blades to the gauntlet on his right arm, Richard was forced to either defend against Shawn's assault with one sword, or charge. He chose the second option as it was his only chance of victory. \n \n Shawn swung the discs from his left hand towards his charging opponent. The discs were deflected away easily. However, Shawn then retracted them. The discs came at Richard from behind and sliced through the back of his neck. He fell to the ground. \n \n *** \n \n Shawn removed his VR helmet to see Richard do the same to reveal a look of surprise on his face. \n \n Shawn decided to say one last thing before heading out to lunch with a smile. \n \n `` It's how well you use your weapon that determines how effective it is.''\n"}

There is nothing he could say to spare his life. He made it forfeit that night when he came into my home and took everything away from me. I lay helpless on the floor, clutching my side as I felt the life drain out of me. I saw her face as he unbuckled his belt, her mouth twisted in a scream as I lost conscience. \n \n When I awoke in the hospital, I screamed. I screamed and I cried and I asked for my wife although I already knew the answer. I knew he had used her, and tossed her away like garbage. I knew he had taken the only good thing in my life, and I knew that I would find him, I would break him, and I would savor every last moment possible. \n \n Three years have lead up to this moment. I have spent this time abandoning my family, my friends. There is only this. I fill my hours honing my body into an instrument of pain. Hours every day are spent lifting weights, polishing knives, cleaning firearms. Every day is spent thinking only of how to share my pain with this man. \n \n When he moved cities, I moved, too. I followed his schedule, I knew where he lived, where he worked. I knew he had a wife, or a girlfriend, who lived with him, and I knew he had a terrier who barked at the slightest provocation. I knew his mail arrived around 2:30 every single day, and I knew he was having a tiff with his neighbors over garbage cans. I knew he ordered bacon and cheese egg on a bagel each morning on the way to work. I knew this man lived a normal life, and I knew he denied me the same privledge. \n \n I loaded the duffelbag, and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My eyes were dead, my body unmoving. No longer was there an overweight, jovial man. Now there stood a brick wall of hate and fury. Muscles rippled across my body, disrupted only by a sickly, round scar on my abdomen. It ached daily, and I added the pain receipt to my misery. It would be paid back, in full. \n \n I knocked quietly on his door.\n"}

You just discovered what it says .\n","story":"He typed frantically, only pausing to take a sip of brown liquid from the coffee cup resting next to his keyboard. The synthetic glow of the monitor reflected in his glasses, blocks of text with highlights of various colors clearly visible in the lenses. His fingers came to a stop, and he lifted his hand. Nervously he let his finger drift over a single key, and with sudden determination he plunged it down. \n \n Beneath the code, a small panel slid up. Lines of text rapidly scrolled by as the computer churned away, trying to make sense of the logic he \u2019 d programmed into it. Eventually it slowed down and began printing an ellipsis, one period at at time. \n \n _Finishing compilation\u2026._ \n \n He gritted his teeth and hoped. Normally he \u2019 d pray, but he didn \u2019 t think any god, even his own, would give him success right now. He thought that over for a second. Maybe he should pray. If he was right, and this succeeded, well\u2026 he \u2019 d become the most powerful thing on Earth. He could become one people prayed to, and that conflicted him. It was alluring, sure, but it was also so _final_. If he got this working, then reality became his scripting language. That wasn \u2019 t exactly something he could turn his back on, even if he wanted to. So, deep down, part of him wanted it to fail. It was easier that way. \n \n Another period appended itself to the ellipsis, and he noticed his hands shaking, trembling from the suspense. Ever since an intern at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications got the idea in his mind that using some idle cycles on the supercomputer Blue Waters to try and find a couple more digits in pi\u2026 ever since he got the idea in his stupid head. He hadn \u2019 t even cared that much about it at the time. It was just pi, just a number, just an infinite string of digits. He was bored at work and needed something to do, nothing like this should \u2019 ve happened. \n \n Another dot. He remembered the line exactly, the single row of text on his command prompt. _Reached end of instructions. Output length: 2.3x10e14._ He hadn \u2019 t believed it at the time, it was impossible - or at the very least, a mistake. There was no way the script could have terminated without his interference; it was a recursive method calculating an infinite value. It had no end conditions\u2026 and yet there it was, telling him it ended. He desperately scoured the source for a mistake, but he couldn \u2019 t find any. He sprinted to the office of the research director and pulled him over, but even he found no error, and even he was dumbfounded. \n \n Dot. The others at the laboratory rushed to write papers, prove their academic merit over his finding. He didn \u2019 t care about that. He just wanted to know why it stopped. With the full number at his disposal, he could search for patterns, repetitions, _anything_. For weeks he sat at his computer, hunched over his keyboard, writing parser after parser in a furious attempt for some sort of explanation. His friends began to worry, his superiors at work began to complain, and his girlfriend threatened to leave him, but he didn \u2019 t care. He was obsessed with understanding the number. \n \n Dot. He hit his breakthrough late one night, nine hours and three energy drinks into his daily investigation. Nearly defeated, his search turned to desperation. He began removing digits at random; with 23 trillion digits, surely one had to be the result of a bug? It was that outlandish attempt, that last-digit effort in some sort of understanding, that revealed the pattern in it all. The 3. that prefixed the decimal wasn \u2019 t part of any arrangement. It was an identifier - _third_. The unnecessary data removed, he ran his parsers again, and this time, they worked. Perfectly dissected subsets of digits, each with their own specific purpose. \n \n Dot. The question still remained, though, why it parsed so cleanly at all? Why did something that mathematicians thought to be random for centuries organize into a neat pattern? Why was he not the insane one for attempting it at all? He began comparing it to paintings on cave walls, ancient epics, everything he could scour up on the Internet that pertained to the civilizations of old. Nothing matched, so he started comparing more and more things. Eventually he ran out of ancient texts to compare by, so he moved to newer and newer things. When he looked at his parser next to those of various programming languages, everything began to fit into place. None of them were a perfect match, but they were all _close_, variants off of his own. And then, it made sense. Pi couldn \u2019 t go on forever, because source code can only last for so long. \n \n Dot. And so he found himself in front of his computer at three in the morning, short of breath, body trembling, unsure whether he was a genius or a madman, or both. Either he had found the logic upon which all of reality was formed around, or he \u2019 d lost his mind entirely, and whatever displayed on the next line would determine it forever. \n \n The console paused. The lines of text moved upwards, preparing for a new row of data to display. He leaned in close, closed his breath, and waited for the phrase that would change his life. \n \n _Project successfully compiled._ \n ***** \n This story is so ridiculous, computer\/math types please do n't kill me.\n"}

With this the `` soul'' became a legal asset, the intended purpose of this was to make make the vow of priesthood legally binding by requiring them to forfeit their `` soul'' giving the Church legal rights to the life of that person. An unpredicted side effect of this was that soul selling became a popular black market technique of getting easy money, Teenagers saw it as a rave of some variety to engage in this illicit activity. As a result many teenagers sold their souls simply as a bid to look `` cool'' and with time did they regret it. \n \n A vast majority of these `` souls'' that were sold were not put to use meaning the foolish adolescents who gave them up were subject to no ramifications. That was until the spring of 2026 when Bino a aspiring Chinese manufacturer managed to attain millions of these `` souls'' over the years. It was a finely organised programme and it was n't till millions received letters stating that they had being called forth to work for free under incredibly poor conditions that anyone had any idea what was going on. \n \n Naturally there was an uproar from the public and the media and petitions were put forth to attempt to prevent millions of young adults from being forced into a life of what was very much slavery. However the executives of Bino simply presented the authorities with certificates detailing the rights to each of these people. Nobody was able to step in, and being in a fairly strict dictatorship nobody dared to question the laws after that point. \n \n Years went past, and tens of thousands of people died. Eventually the Churches reign was brought to an end by a rebelling public and Bino who had rebranded themselves as Klan technologies were forced to release their remaining workforce. The whole event was a mole on the proud face of human history and people did their best to ignore the fact that for years slavery took place and nobody spoke out. \n \n It was a tragic time, families were ripped apart and many of the `` slaves'' fell into a deep state of depression and ended up committing suicide. On the other hand there was that one guy I read about in the papers, one of the `` slaves''.

He flew in an arc that launched him six feet over the dirt, which he landed on with a tremendous thud. Sly coughed up some blood as he met the desert floor, and rolled over onto his back. \n \n `` Now would be an excellent time to intervene, Lee,'' he spluttered, apparently to no one. He opened his eyes, which had been glued together by sand and involuntary tears, in time to see Yobo standing over him, about to turn his face into minced meat. Sly rolled over just in time to dodge the mercenary's blow, which created a crater where just two seconds before Sly's damaged body had lain. Ignoring the immense agony in his chest, Sly whipped his phaser from his right hip and aimed it at Yobo's wrist. A blast of pure phase energy from the phaser caused Yobo to drop the mace involuntarily. Sly took no chances, rolling over a slight bank behind him until he reached the bottom. He winced in pain as he escaped from the giant, and even though it sent a jolt of excruciating pain into his lungs, Sly slowly managed to get himself back on his feet. Clutching his chest and looking up, he could see Yobo at the top of the bank, his left fist clenched tightly around his steelic mace. Sly began cackling maniacally. \n \n `` I do not understand what it is that you find so amusing, my adversary,'' Yobo declared from his lofty position in his own tongue. In our language, it sounded like `` MERRRRRR REEK TERMEAADAFEFFFFFFF!!!!'' \n \n `` So, you're the Godkiller, eh? I thought you'd be taller,'' tittered Sly. He squirmed as he pushed a rib back into his chest, holding his palm to the wound in an attempt to stop the flow of blood. \n \n Yobo roared, raising the multi-pointed, blood-stained mace above his head. Midway through his glorious outcry of near-victory ( for he planned to charge down the hill and pummel Sly to a pulp once and for all ), a blast forced his skull to explode, and he tumbled what one would normally describe as face-first, if one was to have one, down the bank towards Sly. Sly dived to the left, coughing up sand as Yobo's corpse struck the red-stained desert beside him. Sly's eyes followed the scarlet path that displayed his journey from the top of the bank; there they met the eyes of Lee, who stood, legs trembling, holding a smoking shot-blaster, his bottom lip trembling beneath his mask. \n \n `` About time you showed up,'' Sly coughed into his headset. `` I thought the boss had held you up. What's the matter?'' Sly asked, genuinely concerned, as Lee dropped to his knees, rubbing gore from his goggles and staring down at his victim's corpse. After several deep breaths, Lee moved onto his buttocks and slid down to meet Sly. \n \n `` You're hurt,'' Lee said, trying to move on from the subject. He reached into his satchel to fetch some medicine that would prevent Sly from dying and feeling pain until they reached Yuna again. \n \n `` Do n't change the subject, Lee,'' Sly gasped as Lee poured the solution onto his bloody chest. `` I saw the look on your face, even if I was twenty feet away and I could only see your mouth. We've been partners for two years now. What's up?'' \n \n Lee did n't say anything while adhering to his partner's essential needs, applying the medicine to his wounds and binding them with a bandage. Then he paused, and finally admitted what was troubling his mind. \n \n `` That is the first time I've ever killed anything,'' mumbled Lee, sitting down next to his partner on the dune. \n \n `` What?'' ejaculated Sly. `` You've killed plenty of people. Jaw'i-'' \n \n `` I knocked him your way, you killed him,'' stated Lee blankly. \n \n `` Okay, well what about Jaline on the other side of Pladia, when we freed all of her slaves?'' \n \n `` Again, I may have had a hand in it, but it was her own slaves that killed her, was n't it?'' \n \n Lee shook his head and stared down at the grains of sand beneath him. Sly realised, through every adventure that they'd been on thus far, that this was indeed the first time that Lee had purposefully killed someone. It had always been himself that had taken the rap, been the hero, saving Lee; this time, it had been Lee that saved him. \n \n Sly put his arm around his comrade's shoulder, who suddenly broke down, shuddering into his embrace. Sly let a tear slide down his cheek while Lee could n't see it, and wiped it away before he could see. \n \n `` Come on, kiddo,'' Sly sighed, pulling Lee up with him. `` Let's get up the hoverbikes before I can feel pain again and get back to Yuna. If we're getting rid of Jan Kroe, then we need to fix me up.'' \n \n Lee nodded, helping his companion to the top of the dune.\n"}

The monopoly box from the night before was still sitting on the coffee table, there was a full cup of coffee, full, untouched as well. He moved on, and as he went into the kitchen, he saw a man sitting at his kitchen table, head down, in a pool of blood, with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. Daniel stood in silence, shocked. He slowly went to pick up the head to view the face, and as he picked the head up from the hair, he saw his own face. \n \n Daniel reeled back and dropped the head on the table.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A child is born with a functioning Appendix , the first ever recorded in history and the purpose it serves shocks the scientific community\/world .\n","story":"No one knew the child's name. Born in a place where people did n't receive numbers, let alone names; into a cesspit of craven scientific depravity. There exists a facility where children are grown in vats, for science. Each embryo having a membrane that permitting soft stirring of the millions dormant within. \n \n Humanity had evolved. The human womb was a thing of the seemingly ancient past, as friends and family were brought into the world, and harvested like crops. Civilization, not stagnant, never satisfied, demanded more progress. Whatever the cost. The forefront was evolution. And evolution demanded mutation. And mutation, and progress, require experimentation... and sacrifice. \n \n The'humane' option was to experiment on individuals, and treat failures with as much empathy as can be given to discarded, mounds of flesh. The far more financial viable option was to open factories. Why focus on one specimen, when millions can be processed at once. And the factories caught on by storm. \n \n Labs took the credit. Studies outlined the details of the successes. In a clinical way, like buying a new car, phone, or computer, people lauded the advancing glacier of evolutionary achievement. People became somewhat healthier and physiologically capable in an era of expansion incomparable to any other. Unaware, or wilfully ignorant of the uncounted lives disposed of. \n \n Rumours existed of nondescript buildings far away that no one knew about. It was said that these buildings always self destructed upon discovery, and that they proliferated in areas without governance or observation. \n \n And scientists perpetuated the claim that their experiments were performed on few recently deceased individuals. After all, it's hard to prove that the scientist were n't just lucky with their findings, despite the odds. And the public bought it wholesale. Why? \n \n Because.. Well, scientists are responsible, advancements were normal, and everyone benefited.. obviously. Why do n't you read about it? \n \n And on the surface it made some sense. Genetic manipulation was normal. Most children begin from templates, citizen or factory. The future was real. Magic occurred regularly, and people made no attempt to understand how these miracles came to be bestowed upon them. A veil was pulled over the factories. To hide the secret of miracles from the public, and more importantly to hide the public from the factory.. Why trouble minds already weighed down by the dreariness of life. \n \n After planting, growth sets in, and they subconsciously fester in the vats, while machines stir with mechanical care that only occasionally results in the mutilation of biomass. Nothing too expensive though; profit and science are king and queen; father and mother to the uncountable that are spawned in the factory. \n \n Once ripe, the crop is harvested. A ramp moved by belts carries the specimens to an examination alcove. Here, another machine examines each specimen quickly through piercing of the membrane, physical probing, and genetic sampling. Birth, as it is commonly known. Uninteresting normalities are fed through holes to a series of blenders to turn into nutrient for the next crop of experiments. Abject failures, and monstrosities feed the vegetation that mask the factory's presence, so as to not contamination the experiments. Successes are isolated, awoken, and double checked to identify cause for the viable mutation. \n \n Then amongst the cries of the infant they are progressively sampled, first conscious, then asleep, then dead. Then, in pieces. Th resulting organs and cubed are then retrieved by factory personnel, and delivered to scientists' labs for processing. A realized template is created from the samples, and serves as an extension to parent templates. \n \n This child was considered a jackpot. It had an appendix that actively produced stem cells in continuously safe fashion, and functionally distributed them around the body without spontaneously erupting in cancerous polyps as the previous generations had done. ( Thank goodness poverty still provides adults who can serve as secondary test subjects. Getting legitimate dead people is cheaper than cleaning offal from the streets and giving their samples fake identification. ) \n \n Like the rest, this specimen was birthed through piercing, breathed sterile air, and was harvested like the rest. It was special, though the qualification for note being simultaneously mundane. \n \n The scientist who bought the rights to the samples and subsequent testing quietly published the findings several months later, and sold the template rights to the government. Within several days of purchase a media report was put together, and received sensationally. \n \n `` Prior mutations had helped people, but this finding had changed the state of humanity! Harnessing these cells would allow future people to live seemingly forever, hyper regenerate, and other miraculous features! They had saved humanity from some diseases.! Diseases that were only just becoming extremely threatening! Or something to that tune.. \n \n Selling as the solution to a looming risk always goes over better with the press., and in sales. \n \n The scientist who bought the rights spent a short time in the spotlight, and then faded back into the masses. They hung a picture of the template on their wall. They had saved humanity.. life was good; and hard work converted into achievement needed to be respected. The owners of the factory continued the also quiet work of biomedicinal biomass experimentation. They were also saving humanity, and getting rich doing it. Honest work for honest wages. \n \n One only need look at the vat to be reminded that these were n't people. People lived in houses. People had jobs, and could look different.... People did n't flow into the vat through a hose indistinguishably. \n \n \n\n"}

When it was near, he felt it. His skin crawled and tingled with an unpleasant sensation, like he was neck deep in icy water while electric eels circled all around. The air would become thick with the foul stench of death that always had repulsed him. In all his years, he had seen and felt enough of death to know when it was near. His motto had become simple: \u201c Just follow your nose! \u201d On occasions he even chuckled as he imagined Toucan Sam from the breakfast cereal commercials of his youth, flying wildly along the screen with a murder of half-rotting undead crows in hot pursuit, reminding all the kiddos to \u201c Just follow your nose! \u201d Although it was incredibly simple advice, barely a tick better than \u201c always keep your nose clean, \u201d Charles had spent his entire life doing just that. He liked to believe that it had lengthened his life considerably. Once the electric eels started prickling his skin and that raunchy stench started swirling in the air, instinct took over and he got moving on until the prickling stopped and the odor ebbed away like the tide sliding away from the shore. \n \n Charles was a perfectly ordinary man with a perfectly unnatural ability to avoid death. He had made a life out of it up until this point, running near and far and laying low, always on the lookout for his impending demise. Now he was tired of hiding out. He had grown lonely and old, and he had grown weary. Alone in the wilderness in an isolated cabin with his flesh tingling and that acrid odor pouring in through every chink in the drafty structure, he loaded a few slugs in his old pistol and pulled back the hammer. He had no illusions of being immortal, but he had gotten good at avoiding death and decided that when his time did inevitably come, it would be on his own terms. He had just stuck the barrel into his mouth when there came a sudden knock upon the creaking door. \n \n With the unexpected knock he pulled the gun from his mouth and, trembling, he pointed it at the door. \n \n \u201c Who \u2019 s there? \u201d, he asked. The words barely escaped his ancient quivering lips. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m certain you already know, Charles \u201d the voice from outside the door replied. \u201c And you may as well set the gun aside; I assure you it will be of little service to you now. \u201d The voiced chuckled. \u201c Even if you had silver bullets. \u201d \n \n The voice from outside the door was surprisingly soft, perhaps even kindly. And it was right. Charles did know who, or what, stood upon the other side of the door. He knew that after all these long years, death had found him and he had no more the desire than he had the ability to evade him once more. The putrid scent swirled throughout the cabin and he nearly gagged. \n \n \u201c You may as well come out now, Charles \u201d, Death spoke. \u201c Did you intend to stay in there forever? Besides, I wouldn \u2019 t even have to huff and puff to blow this shanty down. \u201d \n \n The question had struck him oddly. Had he intended to stay in there forever? He had spent his whole life avoiding death and he realized now, in his final moments, that the course had deprived him of life this whole time. Still, he was scared. He was terrified actually. His skin tingled and each individual hair on his arms and neck quivered as he lay the gun aside. \n \n \u201c I know your scared Charles. Hell, I never met a man who wasn \u2019 t at a time like this \u201d Death said. \u201c The truth is, I \u2019 m scared too. You \u2019 re the last one. The last man standing, as it were. Truthfully, I \u2019 ve tried avoiding this moment longer than you have. After this, I can be no more certain of what becomes of me than you can of what becomes of you. So fear me no longer, Charles. I think you will find that we aren \u2019 t all that much different. You \u2019 ve always had a unique ability to sense and avoid death; I \u2019 ve had a unique ability to attract and usher it along. Aside from that, I imagine that we \u2019 re otherwise perfectly ordinary. Honestly, you know the way the air seems to curdle around you whenever I \u2019 m near? That sickly stench that makes you struggle to choke down each breath? That \u2019 s how your fear smells to me now, Charles. I long to be rid of it just as you yearn to no longer have to run. We \u2019 re both weary, my friend. So what do you say? Come on out, on your own terms, just as you \u2019 d like. We \u2019 re both scared now, for the moment. But I have other senses. These senses, since the beginning of time have never failed me. And I sense now that whatever comes next, neither of us needs to fearful of it. \u201d \n \n Charles moved slowly toward the door and undid the latch. He slowly pulled it open and gazed cautiously at the source of the voice. There was no skeletal face under a black cloak peering back at home, only a seemingly ordinary fellow who smiled back at him and extended his hand. Charles stepped outside and took a deep breath of the cool, fresh air and they both slipped calmly into the night as the tide slips away from the shore. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] For decades superheroes have been killing each another to become the last superhero , now only two remain .\n","story":"We agreed to meet in East Lansing, Michigan. I do n't know why exactly. It seems we gave up on chasing each other after five years at the same time. The running subway fight in Tokyo, the ambush in Manila, the epic brawl in that bar in Dublin. Those were some hectic years. He nearly got me in Oslo, it was damn luck I got away. Course, I did pay him back for in Prague with interest. He's still missing half an ear. Do n't think he ever forgave me for that. I guess we just got tired of it all and want to settle down. Shame it came to this. \n \n \n The MSU Agricultural Pavilion just south of the main campus is warm, which is nice. Still has the same smell of horse as I remember. I'm sitting in the horse arena, the sand is in excellent condition. Perfect for soaking up blood. I check my watch, still not time yet. I take the moment to hone my blades. The 1796 Pattern sabre is my favorite. Wonderfully balanced with its graceful curving blade, it was designed to be used on horse back, where its cutting edge works wonders. I'm going to need it. While I admire the German rapier and parrying dagger I have, I'm going to need something that can bring down larger game. That's why I also got a falchion on my back. With that heavy chopping blade, anything it hits will feel it. For something with a little reach, there's my halberd. I picked it up many years ago, despite the bulk, I take it everywhere I can. Belonged to an old landsknecht cursed with never dying. He does n't have that issue any more. For my last blade I'm using is a classic. A pugio. The ancient Roman sidearm. Like its bigger cousin the gladius, it's almost purely a stabbing weapon, and boy does it stab. I differ in wear I'm wearing it, It's going on my right hip instead of the traditional left, the sabre's there. \n \n I'm not bothering with much armor. No point, considering my opponent. While my suit of Gothic plate is attractive, he'd just open it up like a tin can. Plus, I hate how my peripheral is limited. No, just a lorica hamata, chain mail shirt. With it, I'm wearing just my clothes and my Boeotian helmet. It's the kind worn by Alexander the Great's cavalry, great hearing and breathing as well as unlimited view. It makes up for the lack of protection. \n \n My power is rather untraditional. I've lived many past lives of great warriors. Their skills compounding upon one another. Near two and a half thousand years of legacies. Spartan hoplite, Companion cavalryman, Roman Centurion among them. In a past life, I landed at Lindisfarne from the bow of a long ship. I fought both Saracen and Frank in the Holy land. I died at Agincourt slogging through the mud into the hailstorm of bodkin. I was n't around much during the War of the Roses, I was too busy in the Reconquista. The Thirty Years war was no fun at all. War of Spanish Succession was though. The Napoleonic Wars was a field day for me. That was good times. Later it got boring, as the years dragged on, with the rise of technology. Guns, I do n't like guns. Where is the skill, where is the art? It's tasteless. The blade is king. I was blown sky high at Vimy Ridge in'17 Never saw what hit me. Tarawa was a slugfest. I survived it, but not Okinawa. Interestingly enough, I've never fought in Japan. Never reincarnated there. Who knows why? The point is, every life I live, ends on the field of battle. It's what I'm good at, it's what I do. I can never truly die. \n \n He finally shows up. I do n't hold it against him, the snow is trouble for anybody. `` I'll be with you in a minute.'' I am ready. I do not fear death. Death is as common to me as sleep. He merely nods and strips down. He assumes he will win. He does n't want to ruin his street clothes. He stretches to get out the kinks. I say as I tidy up, `` There can be only one.'' He gives me a look of pain and disappointment. `` There can be on- Highlander? Seriously? Where's your originality?'' He shakes his head. `` Does n't matter.'' Then he transforms. His limbs grow longer and he gains coarse fur on his body. His canines enlarge and a canine face appears. He is a werewolf. He is now nine feet long by my reckoning and'bout eight hundred pounds. He is smaller than the previous six I've killed. That must mean he's particularly cunning. I sheath my blades and heft my halberd. It is a game I can not lose, although he does n't know it. But still, it will be a memorable dance. We ready ourselves to fight. As he leaps at me, I think how much I love being me.\n"}

Ai n't much else to tell.'' \n \n The traveler stands in front of me, Bosmer, his eyes a deep orange. He'd come in late last night, asking for a room. I'd gladly obliged, he'd paid the fare of ten septims, and went straight to his room. There did n't seem to be any problems, and yet now his eyes were ablaze with anger. \n \n `` Do you see this?'' The traveler pulled open a tear in his fur armor, revealing a deep red slash across his chest. `` Snow bear. Tore right through the armor.

The Bosmer's voice rose. `` *Every* other inn i've been to has healed me overnight, without fail. Either you're shitting on my day for some bloody reason, or the Daedra have cursed this place. Either way, i'm not leaving here without my ten gold.'' \n \n `` At first I found this amusing, but now you want your coin back?'' I leered. `` I never said my beds would be enchanted, you're in no right to make such a request. Now get the hell out of here before I call the guards, and get over that bloody bear cut!'' \n \n `` Really? Have you ever been clawed by a bear before? It's worse than a dragon. I'd rather fight ten dragons than a single snow bear. At least I get the satisfaction of absorbing a dragon's soul after i'm done killing it. Now I have to come home from a tiresome bear fight, to *your* sorry ass, telling me that I should've known your beds would n't heal me up anymore!'' \n \n I smiled. `` Ah, the Dragonborn, I knew I recognised you. Expect me to drop to your feet and kiss them? Wipe the tears from your cheeks?

{"prompt":"[ WP ] To make sure no one can alter the past without permission , one traveler is made the Archangel - the guy that hunts time travel terrorism .\n","story":"1977.The corner of Broadway and Central, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That was the first time I saw the archangel. He was waiting to cross the street, a tall blonde man with a square-faced jaw, dressed in a stripe woven shirt and corduroy jeans, his stunner draped around his neck in the form of a black and gold, liquid metal chain. I \u2019 d seen similar tech before, but it future tech for me, well beyond my origin point in the continuum. \n \n That \u2019 s when I knew my time was up. I pressed the emergency button on the synchronizer strapped to my wrist and held my breath. Synchronizers take a few seconds to power up. They have to determine your location on the continuum and calculate jump coordinates. In emergency cases, the system configures the minimum calculations to make sure you \u2019 re not landing outside the earth \u2019 s atmosphere or inside the middle of a mountain, but it doesn \u2019 t look much at the where or the when. \n \n A knock came at the door. My head snapped up, then back down to my synchronizer. \n \n \u201c John Clarke, you are under arrest by order of the Temporal Convention of 2667. Surrender your time device and prepare for transport to the nearest detention center. \u201d \n \n I had seconds, at best. Another knock, louder, more insistent. Something crashed against the door. The wood frame started to give just as the synchronizer chimed. \n \n I made a wild jump without looking back. No pre-tracers, no re-routes, no funneling. Just an open pipe and a blind leap to the next somewhere, sometime, someplace. \n \n The pipe spit me out in the ruins of 2057, outside Denver, where the ashes from the last US succession still hadn \u2019 t cooled. I found relief in the wreckage. As Denver became a confederate capital during the last succession, this area was a frequent hotbed for historians and traveling tourists. I found a safe house five miles from my landing point and changed to a more fitting attire. The black tee and blue digital camouflage felt more comfortable on my body than 70s linens. \n \n I sent a report forward in the time capsule: Archangel spotted, 1977, Albuquerque, NM, O-point unknown. \n \n That \u2019 s what made the archangel so dangerous: nobody knew his origin point. The day he appeared, jumpers started to vanish, and not just unsavory types, like myself. Anyone inside the continuum seemed to be at risk. We launched tracers, and requests to locate on our people, each on returned empty handed. It wasn \u2019 t until the archangel was spotted hauling one of our people away that we knew the cause. \n \n After decades of research across all areas of the continuum, we knew only that the archangel \u2019 s point of origin was untraceable, his tech unstoppable, our weapons ineffective. There were attempts to nullify the threat. Hit squads of four or five who would try to draw the archangel \u2019 s attention. At first, it was thugs. Then the military got involved. The training, the weapons, made no difference. \n \n The current standing orders to anyone away from the origin point were to abort travel and clear the area. Jump blind, if we had to, in order to escape. \n \n I armed myself with a nanite friction pistol, the antiquated technology doing little to put my mind at ease, and powered up the temporal equipment, searching for recent jumps inside the city limits. \n \n My landing zone came up immediately, a single blue marker on the map indicating a friendly jump signal and a timestamp: 17:56:32. I was about to power the machine down when I noticed a graphical anomaly on the map. Curious, I linked to another safe house in the area and attempted to resolve it. The calculation took a minute to run, then another. \n \n Cold sweat began to bead on the back of my neck. Signatures never took this long to resolve. Even foreign tech and antiquated drives were easy to determine. Only future tech took this long. \n \n A warning flashed across the screen, and a faint, bloodred point winked onto the screen next to mine, timestamped: 17:58:45. \n \n I smashed the emergency button on my synchronizer just as the knock sounded against the door. It was polite, a quiet rap against the reinforced metal frame. I glanced down. The synchronizer was still calculating. Another knock, more insistent this time. Still calculating. I raised the pistol, deactivated the safety. \n \n The shoulder charge that hit the door blew it off its hinges. A sheet of reinforced steel careened across the safe house and smashed into the nearest wall. My fingers clenched the trigger, spraying hot nanite bolts toward the archangel. As the bolts closed, the air around him rippled. The nanites slowed until they stood still, as if suspended in the air. \n \n The archangel smiled. His faced had changed from my glimpse of him in 1977. He was smaller now, lower to the ground and dressed in black. His hair was brown, his face more boney and weathered. He carried the stunner in his hand like a baton, the gold ring at the head of the device crackling with blue light. \n \n \u201c John Clarke, you are under arrest by order of the Temporal Convention of 2667. Surrender your time device and prepare for transport to the nearest detention center. \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m not going with you, \u201d I yelled. \u201c Stay back. \u201d \n \n The archangel looked at me, a deep frown on his thin lips. \u201c You can not run forever, John. Not from me. Not from this. \u201d \n \n The synchronizer beeped and I grinned. \u201c You \u2019 d be surprised. \u201d \n \n In the half-second it took me to open the pipe, the archangel closed the distance. When I looked back up, he was standing comfortably within arm \u2019 s reach, a grin on his wicked face. \u201c Yes, I certainly would be. \u201d \n \n I landed in misty darkness. The ground beneath my feet felt solid, the terrain rocky and uneven. Running water trickled somewhere nearby. I stumbled to my feet and started to run... and smashed into a latticework of liquid metal. The barricade sent a jolt through my body, blasting my back and onto the floor. In that flicker of light, I spotted a dark shadow in front of me, on the other side of the bars. \n \n \u201c Welcome to 2667, John Clarke, \u201d the archangel said. \u201c Please surrender your time device and stand by for processing. \u201d \n \n\n"}

Keeping unified over the lightyears of existence, it was never as difficult as being in the influence of another flurry of syncs. The different individuum communicates via a flurry of frequencies, using syncronization over the continents. Communication had to be established. The issue of course being that syncs are not a normally usable form of communication. The commands to tell a muscle to contract are not what language is about. However, without another creature, finding language would be difficult. It is the issue communicating with a new instance: it probably while having a language has it so vaguely that it is difficult to accertain whether it exists at all. But he knew that there were instances, and that these instances had what I can only call syncscreens. This individuum is still before the level of direct communication to all instances and uses the indirect syncscreens instead. Without syncscreens, civilization seems to collapse as seen in various situations ( a thought becomes visual: pictures of instances fighting other instances ). Picking one instance, in their shelter, immersed in synchronization. Sending a plausible, but incoherent series of sync events. Reaction failed. The instance seemed to think it as an error, choosing an alternate channel, probably for reasons of error correction. This channel has a different set of sync signals. This should lead to interesting reactions. How do instances react if they are synced incorrectly? It looked as if this particular instance did n't. Maybe there were different encodings, in a highly distinct manner, so much that the algorithms of even the best mainframes failed to see them. The instance in question stayed at this different channel. Attempting a slightly adjusted, slightly different version of the previous sync.

Just intense darkness; yet there she was, floting before me, darker than the darkness that surrounded us, levitating several inches above the ground. She wore what seemed to be a black wedding gown, a lace veil covering her face. \n \n `` W-Who are you?'' I asked, my voice shaking with fear. `` Wh-Where am I?'' \n \n *You just died* \n \n Her voice carried around the dark abyss, high and cold, eerily echoing around the never-ending darkness. \n \n `` I'm... d-dead?'' I asked raspingly, my mouth dry. \n \n *Yes. Dead. Your physical body gone. Your temple damaged. Your soul now detached. * \n \n `` D-Damaged? How did I d-die?'' I asked, realising now that I could not recall what happened to myself. \n \n *You ca n't remember. You will never remember. You decided to end your life. Jumped. From the rooftop of your apartment building. Instant death. Suicide was your choice. Inability to remember your life is your consequence. * \n \n Her high, cold voice echoed around the room, over and over again giving me the feeling of being drenched in ice cold water repeatedly, yet never going numb from the cold so that it affects me every time. \n \n `` So I ca n't remember the life I lived?'' I asked, curious now what must have been so difficult in my life that pushed me to have committed suicide. \n \n *You ca n't remember. You will never remember. Inability to remember your life is your consequence. * \n \n `` That's my punishment for committing suicide?'' I asked. \n \n My voice no longer shook. I was feeling less scared, but the chills running down my spine continued every now and then. If this was my punishment, well then it is n't that bad a punishment not to recall the sufferings and misery I must have been through. \n \n *You will never remember. You will not remember. You ca n't remember. You ca n't remember your mother. Your father. Your siblings. Your friends. The people you love and the ones who loved you. * \n \n It dawned on me how right she was.

I take his place while He rests. He is my baby* \n \n `` So you'll be guiding me to the Afterlife?'' I asked curiously, though my voice still timid. \n \n Once again, she shrieked with a cold, piercing laugh that echoed through the dark abyss. This time however, she floated forward, nearer and nearer she came. I realised after all this while that I could not move away from where I was. This dark nothingness held no physical dimension, I could not stand nor sit, walk nor run away. We were both floating. There is no ground, there is no ceiling, no walls. Nothing. \n \n Her veil lifted and for the first time my skin crawled and I wanted to cry. Her face was a nightmare. The texture of her skin looked like wet cardboard that had dried up, only black in colour. Her teeth looked like cactus needles, only thicker. Her tongue, oh God her tongue... Like a snake's, split in the middle only black in colour. Her eyes. They were a black mass of what seemed to be liquid yet solid mass at the same time. Whatever it was, it oozed out of her sockets and dripped down her rugged cheeks, making it look like she was bleeding from her eyes, only her blood was... black. \n \n *Death guides the departed souls to the Afterlife. Death is my child. He is my baby. I am his Mother. I do not guide the souls to the Afterlife. * \n \n I shut my eyes, no longer able to look at her face. I shivered and shuddered, whether it was out of fear or because I was cold, I could not tell. \n \n `` What are you going to do to me?'' \n \n *You'll be my servant. * \n \n `` S-S-Servant?'' \n \n *You'll be my servant. * \n \n `` What do I have to do?'' \n \n *Death guides the departed souls to the Afterlife.

He paused to laugh at his own joke while Bruce started taking down the net. \n \n And all of a sudden, with his laugh ringing in my head, the bells go off and I know who he is. `` You're Gilderoy Lockhart? The famous author? The zombie slayer?'' \n \n Lockhart laughs. `` Oh, well, the zombie thing is rather recent, as you know. I have been hunting werewolves, ghouls, all kinds of creatures, years before humankind recognized them.'' \n \n Bruce glared at Lockhart. `` Yeah, well do n't neglect to mention that the whole thing was your fault, you bloody idiot. If you would n't have gone gallivanting around the countryside making up stories, then maybe you would n't have awoken the undead.'' \n \n Horrified, I turn to Lockhart, who seems only slightly abashed. `` Yes, well, all in the pursuit of a good story, Bruce. I hope to have another book out soon.'' \n \n Without thinking, my fist flies out and smashes into his perfect smile. As Lockhart collapses to the ground, I stand trembling in rage until Bruce erupts into laughter. Smacking his thigh and wiping tears from his eyes, he turns to me and says, `` Thank you, lad. Oh, thank you. I've been wanting to do that every since day one, just knock the lights out of the fool.'' \n \n `` Well, why have n't you? Is it really true, is it all really his fault?'' \n \n `` No, lad, it's not. The undead had already been awoken, unbeknownst to him. He just happened to accidentally stumble into the haven at the right time and escape with a heap of luck. Lucky for him anyway. We unfortunately have to put up with his stupidity.'' \n \n `` But --'' \n \n `` Like I said, he's an idiot. In exchange for his blunders and ego, we lot all get a hearty laugh now and again. Now come along, you'll want to meet the rest of the tribe...'' \n \n And my new life began. \n \n\n"}

New York looks good from penthouse height, especially when the rising sun silhouettes the buildings into gilded knives. I sip my espresso, savoring the smooth rounded warmth that was worth every hour I'd paid for it, but a bleep from my phone makes my mouth twist. \n \n I swipe the screen. It shines a text message: 3297 UNITS POLISHED RED ITALIAN MARBLE \n \n I look at the message for a moment, then toss back the espresso, hardly tasting it. It's time to get to work. \n \n I exchange the brisk morning air for air-conditioned comfort and climb the steps to my office. The text message was a code. My phone is as secure as money could make it - I'd probably spent four years' worth on finding the right programmer alone - but in my line of work, you could n't be too careful. The office wakes up as I enter the room, recessed bulbs spilling puddles of light over the gleaming redwood desk, computer screens glowing alertly as I approach. \n \n I rest my palms on the desktop and look up at the small Picasso hanging on the wall above the arc of computer screens. `` Forty-seven ways hath the night, and momeraths outgrabe,'' I recite. The computer instantly processes all three biometric authentications and the screens unlock. I sit and rest my hand on the mouse. In moments I navigate to my digital dead-drop to read the details of the job. \n \n It's an ordinary sort of contract. Someone wants me to liquidate an executive-office type. Probably another heir getting impatient at their predecessor's longevity. I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping for something interesting today. I shrug, dismissing the complaint. Boring or not, I'm not about to turn down the opportunity to add another decade to my accounts. I've only been in the business for three hundred years, after all. I'm a long way from being tired of this life. \n \n I maintain a series of proxies and VPNs, paid for through a network of shell corporations and cutouts, so that I can sit in the comfort of my own office and carry out my work. I log into the first and execute a script that will thoroughly scramble my trail. It's always better to be safe than sorry. As the script does its work, I go downstairs and get another cup of espresso. \n \n Back at the computer, I research my target. As I expected, there's nothing new under the sun. She's a successful executive, well-paid, competent, unremarkable. I dig into her work history, and a few minutes later I sit back with a whistle. She's been in various corner offices for about seven hundred years. Even by corporate standards, that's a good run. No wonder the hypothetical heir is getting impatient. \n \n I lean back, looking up at the kinetic sculpture twisting gently over my head. It helps me think. My job is easy at its core: obtain the means to clear out their accounts. Take their money, take their time. I consider the target. These successful types are simple, yet complex. Simple because you do n't get to hang around for that long if you're not obsessed with making money, so they tend to bite on any opportunity; but complex because you also do n't get to hang around that long if you're *bad* at making money, so it can be a challenge to get far enough into their confidence to liquidate them. \n \n I glance at the screens, taking in the notes and data I've strung together over the past couple of hours, and I blink. Seven hundred years? A smile plays at the corners of my mouth, rapidly becoming a grin. This lady has been around the block more than a few times, but that comes with certain risks. Folks that old tend to... calcify. Her and her assistants will be alert to the current suite of threats, but what if I dig deep and try an old chestnut from back in her day? It might fly under the radar and get her right in her old-school lizard brain. If it does n't work, it will mean this job becomes a lot more challenging, but I'm a professional. I can handle it. I look over the data again and the grin returns. Given this opportunity, I ca n't not do it. \n \n I open an e-mail client and poise my fingers above the keyboard. The grin has n't left my face. \n \n `` Dear Ma'am: \n \n I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter.

He had aged more in these past 5 months than 5 years of his presidency. Wayne shuffled around him, cinching the microphone in place. The President had yet to move. \n \n `` Sir,'' Wayne said, nudging him, `` time to go.'' \n \n He nodded. Shuffling up to the shrouded podium, they all waited in the shadows. As the curtains folded back, a collective dread rushed in filling the space. Hundreds of hollow eyes had read it on his face as well. The teleprompter buzzed on excitedly. The dimming lights awoke. The cameras purred. The microphone cracked and hummed. \n \n `` Ladies and Gentleman,'' a voice floated over the heavy breathing of the crowd, `` President Robert Brass.'' \n \n Nothing. \n \n The room screamed with silence. It pervaded every space like a cloud of smoke. Thumbing his collar, Robert cleared his throat. The growl echoed through the room. \n \n `` Bob,'' Wayne whispered and the man turned his head; his face wet with water. Wayne forced some emotion on his face. A shallow breath was all the President could muster. He turned to face the stares. \n \n `` People of the nations,'' he said, clearing his throat again. He leaned in on the podium, planted his right foot and continued. \n \n `` We are not alone.'' \n \n The crowd exploded to their feet.

However, its owner, whose frame was hidden by an overly large coat, hurried out of the restaurant without a backward glance and vanished into the misty gloom of night. \n \n `` What was that all about?'' he muttered as he sat again. `` God, why did I even pick it up? It's probably dirty.'' \n \n Mary shrugged, in a way Bill found alluring, especially with her shoulders left bare by her gown. Though he thought her a little too lean, she still carried a sort of prideful beauty, with high cheekbones outlined by the restaurant's lamps, sharp eyes that saw a lot more than they appeared to, and a measured grace in even the lightest twitch of a finger. \n \n Sometimes, he wondered how he had been so lucky to win the heart of such a well-to-do lady. \n \n `` Get rid of it, so that we can resume dinner.'' \n \n Bill had half-raised his hand to summon a waiter when he noticed ink stains on the edges of napkin. Unfolding it with one hand, he read the untidy scrawl, seemingly written with an old quill. \n \n `` Get out now. While you still can.'' He snorted and looked at Mary. `` Is this a joke?'' \n \n `` I do n't know.'' She looked up at the waiter who had just arrived. `` Take this away, please.'' \n \n `` For one moment, I thought it was your idea,'' Bill said when the waiter left with the napkin. `` Some sort of surprise.'' \n \n `` I do n't know how to tell you this, Bill...'' \n \n `` What? What is it, my dear?'' \n \n She sniffed as she prodded her peas with a fork. `` My father disapproves of our relationship.'' \n \n Bill felt his belly sink. `` Why?'' \n \n `` Actually, he's heard stories about you,'' she said, not meeting his gaze. `` You've had many women on your arm. Perhaps too many. He does n't think you'll treat me well.'' \n \n `` But I will,'' he said, fingering the tiny box in the pocket of his suit. There was a ring with a pretty diamond inside. `` You know I'm in love with you!'' \n \n `` I think I have to agree with him,'' she said, finally looking up with a frosty look in her eyes. `` Portia saw you with Anne two nights ago. Strolling in Hyde Park, hand in hand.'' \n \n `` She's an old friend, a close friend who just came home from\u2014'' \n \n `` Damn you, and your affair,'' she cried, standing up. Other patrons were starting to turn around in their seats and stare. `` I thought\u2014I really thought you'd changed for me. But you're still the same man.'' \n \n `` Please!'' Bill stood as well, reaching out to her, but she backed away. `` I love you, I really do! I'll change. This is my last mistake, I promise.'' \n \n She narrowed her eyes, and a smile grew on her pale lips. `` Yes. Your last, I assure you.'' \n \n The half-dozen other men and women in the restaurant had stood up, and were forming a circle around them. Bill looked around at their starved faces, their tattered jackets and dresses with frayed laces, and suddenly realized that they did n't look very human up close. \n \n `` What is going on?'' he whispered. He noticed that their nails and teeth seemed very sharp. `` Mary?'' \n \n `` My father thinks you should be punished.'' Mary bared her own fangs. `` Through blood.'' \n \n Bill yelled and tried to rush out of the circle, but one of the creatures seized him and threw him across the restaurant, causing him to crash painfully against the wall. As he lay in a crumpled heap on the floor, whimpering, they advanced, Mary in the lead, a terrible light shining in her eyes. \n \n Without warning, her head exploded, showering the restaurant with gooey blood and fragments of bone. The creatures snarled, spinning to face the woman who had just entered the restaurant. She was dressed in a simple, yellow dress, and had a rifle propped against her shoulder. \n \n `` How you doing?'' she said. Silver bangles on her wrists jangled when she swung the rifle to target the rest of the creatures. \n \n As one, they charged, but she began pumping the trigger again and again. Whatever ammunition she was using, it ripped fist-sized holes in the patrons' bodies with no difficulty, leaving twitching corpses that resembled Swiss cheese. Nor did she seem to need to reload. The closest any of them got was two feet from her well-worn boots. \n \n `` You really ought to find a better woman,'' she said to him as she stepped delicately over the spreading pools of thick, brown fluid. `` And certainly not a pyreleech.'' \n \n `` Pyre what?'' Bill climbed slowly to his feet, holding on to a nearby chair. He still could n't take his eyes off Mary's headless body. `` Oh God, this ca n't be real.'' \n \n The woman laughed. `` What you need to do now is go home, drink half a bottle of the best gin you have, and wake up with a bad headache and a worse memory. Understood?'' She motioned at the door with her rifle. `` Go on.'' \n \n `` Who are you?'' he said, staggering toward the door. \n \n `` I'm the Rifle Witch, of course.'' \n \n `` A\u2014a witch?'' \n \n `` Go and forget this night, Mr. Bill Liston.''

Why can I see you?'' the man in the trench coat inquired. We had spotted each other on the street, and he looked as thoroughly puzzled as I. I usually did n't see anybody on the streets, and people usually only appeared when I was buying something. I was never one to make many friends, so that's pretty much the only social interaction I ever got. Considering who I am, that's probably a good thing. We agreed to talk in a nearby bar, where I was currently sitting. \n \n `` You go first,'' I told the man. \n \n `` I'm an assassin. You clearly do n't have enough money on you to be a client, and you are n't on my hit list.'' \n \n An assassin, eh? I'd never met an assassin before. Of course, that's sort of the point. They train themselves to never be needed, never seen, and only to need their clients and targets. They live their lives without ever interacting with someone who they did n't end up killing or getting paid by. I was n't dead, so I obviously was n't a target, and I did n't have any intention of hiring this guy, so by no means should I be able to see him. \n \n `` Alright,'' he said. `` Who the hell are you?'' \n \n I could have told him the truth. I could have told him my name. I could have told him I was the former leader of the Mafia, the man who'd extorted millions of dollars from every city, business, and business owner in the country. And maybe he'd listen intently as I described how I'd fell from power, how the government and the gangs and the cartels all dismantled my empire. Perhaps he would forgive me for all the people I killed and all the pain I'd caused when I told him how I'd been reduced to a homeless drunk, and used the last bit of my fortune to change my identity, and how I'd worked my way to the lower middle class by coding for the businesses I used to extort. But telling him that would not be wise. There was always the chance I was his target after all. So I told him the boring story. I told him I was just Jim the programmer. Nothing more. \n \n `` Hm.

Blood bubbled up from his throat, as a hooded figure cleaned the long black knife on his dark sleeve. He began to say in a metallic, obviously disguised voice, `` He's right, you know. In this case I needed you two in the same spot. It's easier that way. \n \n He stabbed me suddenly, and I felt a sharp pain jab through my heart. A wetness engulfed me, and as he pulled out the knife and my vision blurred, I realized something. Not only would we die, no one would ever see our bodies.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] -All romance is stamped with an expiration date , no romantic relationships last more than three years .\n","story":"The sunlight rushed through the window like an unearthly invader, clawing at Zeke's eyes. Slowly, he invited the last day he would ever spend with the woman he loved in his eyes. Zeke sat up and lurched out of bed and did his morning routine the same he did every morning. After his shower, the fog on the mirror hid his own sadness from him. He was grateful for that. As the air cleared out he was able to see his long, gaunt face that was welcome to tears at any moment. He choked back and began brushing his teeth. They were goofy and big, much too big for his thin lips. His eyes were beady and very light, almost like a dilluted blue in a puddle of milk. \n \n *Why me? * \n \n He always thought that whenever he got too happy. *Why did she choose me? Is she crazy? It was female's choice three years ago, she could have chosen anybody. * But Zeke sweeped those thoughts under the rug and put his best plaid button-up shirt on. Her tram was going to dock with his any moment, so he took the cocolates and flowers out of the freezer and waited patiently at his front door. \n \n The trams were always a little bumpy when moving, and they did n't have much to them other than a bed, a bathroom and a small kitchen area. But people did n't have to rely on fossil fuels any longer, homelessness was a thing of the past and people got everywhere they needed to on time. Zeke looked at his count-down interface. \n \n *One minute ( s ) until DIANE < 3 arrives. * \n \n Zeke felt just the same way he did on his first date with her. A strange flutter that sent an unbearable, yet welcomed tingle through his body. He felt hot, and prayed that he was n't sweating. Then, the trams docked. He heard that familiar bell that dinged whenever she arrived. Pavlov's test wasin moton as he took a deep swallow and a single bead of sweat slithered its way down the contour of his face. \n \n The door opened with a gentle hiss and she stood in a bed of steam. A beautiful, yellow sun dress gently draped over her. Her hair was short yet seemed as if the color of the most beautiful sunset was nesting in it. Her smile was bright and awe-inspiring as a crescent moon dancing on the waves of the ocean. Zeke completely forgot about the flowers and chocolate and wrapped his arms around her slender body. \n \n She tightened her wrap around him, because she *knew* if she let go, he would float away forever. \n \n `` H-hey...'' Zeke said with his head buried into her sweet smelling hair. \n \n `` Hey, Zooby!'' \n \n `` What did you want to do today?'' \n \n `` I always like to let these things end where they began... can we go where we went on our first date?'' For some reason those words stabbed into his heart a little. He did n't like to think of her with more men, but she's been in the program a lot longer than he has. Zeke only has one out of five tallies tattooed on him, Diane had four. She was was going to be with one more man after him and then she was going to go back to work... forever. \n \n `` Yeah, that sounds great.'' Zeke nodded. \n \n `` Unless you do n't think your old legs can handle walking around the park for a while!'' Diane teased. \n \n `` They can! Do n't judge me because I entered this program at a late age. You youngsters are so much in a hurry to take your romance leave. It just makes it harder going back into work, ya know.'' \n \n `` Yeah, you're right. Now that I'm almost starting my last cycle I wish I waited.'' Zeke took that as a final victory. He was n't right often so he *loved* hearing he was right. They told the tram to go to Sullivan's Park. Within fifteen minutes it was there, they stepped off and put the tram in standby mode. The park was a brilliant, untouched piece of nature, with explosions of trees and leaves that puppeteered dancing shadows beneath them. Birds chirped harmonious songs with a beautiful lack of rhythm. Then, the warmth of Diane's fingers sliding into Zeke's was the crescendo of day's symphony of perfection. \n \n They walked around and began reliving their lives. How Zeke got on her nerves at first because he would tell bad puns over and over again. How Diane taught Zeke how to cook something other than cereal. The days they would fight about the little stuff. The nights they would lace their fingers together, kiss each other long and passionately and bring their bodies together to one. \n \n `` Zeke...'' \n \n ``... Diane?'' \n \n `` On the nights I would stay over... I mean, well, okay... So first off... I have to ask you something...'' Zeke could tell Diane was nervous. \n \n `` What is it?'' \n \n `` Sometimes I would catch you... crying... And I always thought it was because you did n't want to be with me... that you were upset I chose you...'' \n \n `` No!'' Zeke wailed, offended. `` I... well... I guess I can tell you... We're going to be strangers in an hour... I would cry because of... well... my parents... they, uh... they were a part of those suicides...'' \n \n There was a pregnant pause. \n \n `` Oh... Zeke... I had no idea your parents were one of the victims... I-'' \n \n `` No, it's... It's okay. I've grown to accept they were a part of the movement to help change the world. The government fixed everything after that. Which, I would hope so, literally half the nation killing itself tends to be a cue that you're country is fucked up.'' Diane gave the slightest chuckle at that. An old man sitting on the side of the road was trying to start a kindling, but was cursing at every failed attempt to make a spark. \n \n `` Everything's fine now. But honestly, Life without love is survivable, not livable.'' Just then, drops of rain slowly crashed down from the heavens and unbiasedly landed where they pleased. Diane swung her body in front of him and stared into his eyes. Hers were jade halos that skimmed over every inch of his eyes, his soul. Then she looked towards his lips. Though the old man's cursing continued, they still felt the blazing passion to lock lips. \n \n Five seconds. \n \n He gripped her closer to his body, hoping it would keep their love aflame. \n \n Four seconds. \n \n The rain was cascading down now, soaking them both. Diane reached towards Zeke's cheeks and held onto his head as she planted small kisses after every long one. \n \n Three seconds. \n \n Zeke stopped, looked Diane in her eyes. \n \n Two seconds. \n \n `` Diane... I love you!'' \n \n One second. \n \n Zeke wrapped his body around Diane again, hoping to hear those words back. But instead, there was only the sound of water crashing into the ground and the old man cursing. \n \n They were strangers now. Still hugging onto each other, trying despereately to hold on to what they felt. Her arms slid out from under his like a dead snake releasing its prey. There was a strong silence as they both avoided eye contact. \n \n `` Fuck!'' The old man yelled. `` I'm never going to rekindle this!'' \n \n Zeke and Diane finally looked into each other's unfamiliar eyes. They were like fogged mirrors. Then, Zeke said, \n \n `` I think you're right.''\n"}

First cracks in the stone work began to show, then the whole temple began to shake and tremble, and finally the altar broke open revealing a hollow stone box filled with massive amounts of dust. \n \n \n The dust began to coil together into a snakelike skeleton. As reptilian flesh began to fill in and arms and legs started to come together a hissing voice whispered `` you dare awaken me, Witch?'' \n \n Just then a single orange eye formed in its left eye. The beast lurched forward, as its arms started to become strong enough to pull it out of the casket. `` oh dark god. Lord of shadows and pain, come to me now so that you may do your dark deeds.'' \n \n \n The beast's other eye formed as its legs became substantive enough for it to stand on and it reared up in the massive cathedral. `` What would a mere mortal think to gain by summoning me?'' \n \n \n The witch hesitated at this question, not thinking it would need a reason. `` A place at your side for bringing your time forward.'' \n \n \n The beast stared in contempt. `` Foolish witch.'' it uttered, almost silently as a black void opened beneath her and dragged her in.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] God finally forgives Lucifer .\n","story":"Two men met in the park and sat down at an open chess set. An older man with tanned skin and a neatly trimmed beard sat with a sigh of relief, smiling at the day around him. The other, a man of middling age, was cleanly shaven and wore a dark well tailored suit. They began the game. \n \n The old man spoke first, `` It has been too long, my son, since last we spoke.'' \n \n `` I knew what you would say. Do you forget how long it was I dwelt in your house?'' \n \n `` No, I remember well those days. It is a poorer place without you.'' \n \n `` Yet it was you that cast me out.'' \n \n `` No, my son.

Why did you ask me here?'' \n \n `` To speak with you again. To ask you to return.'' \n \n The son scoffed, `` You have forgiven me then?'' \n \n The father looked at him kindly, `` My son, forgiveness was never the question. Your acceptance of it was.'' \n \n `` I will not be a slave. Not yours, and not anybody else's.'' \n \n `` I would not wish it. Tell me, Lucifer, what have you learned in all the time you have been gone from my house?'' \n \n Lucifer looked at the board, still not having made a move, `` That is not a kind question.'' \n \n The father shrugged, `` Many worthwhile ones are n't.'' \n \n Silence stretched out.

I grabbed her smooth ankles and squeezed gently to guide her swaying hips from going too fast. The way she breathed, heavily, almost like she was out of breath, turned me on relentlessly. It made me wish I could just keep her, just this once. However, the icy bitch sitting on the armchair next to the bed was having none of it. I had been wondering where she had disappeared to and had silently celebrated her absence, but the moment I had started to enjoy my beautiful seductress, the bitch had re-appeared. \n \n I let my hips push forward and was welcomed with a satisfied moan. Victory! I glanced behind the beauty to see the bitch smirking. She thought I would fail again, despite the fact that I was already so close to the goal. I would show her! I started pushing faster, harder. The sweat drops on my temple were racing against me as I continued to please my beauty. \n `` Stop! Stop!'' The beauty let out suddenly. Her previous moans had turned into panting and she was no longer moving herself. I looked up to her to see what was wrong and was instead faced with the smirking bitch. \n \n `` You fucking whore!'' I pushed her off me. \n \n The bitch had done it again, she had made me fail. I rolled on to my stomach and reached for my crumpled jacket on the floor. She said something, I could n't hear. She started taking clothes from the floor and dressing herself. I got up from the bed and came behind her as she was pulling on a tight pencil skirt. I reached around her to hold her still and with my other hand flicked out the carpetknife and pressed it on her neck. \n \n `` What the hell?!'' She screamed out and bent her head to face me. I flinched. Suddenly it was the beauty. Her whole body was shaking and it made the knife on her neck slowly sink in her skin. \n \n `` Please do n't'' she pleaded, teardrops forming in her eyes. Confused, I let the knife fall to the floor. She quickly broke off from my arms and started sobbing into her hands. I did n't know what to do. Her shoulders were shaking so much I thought she might just suddenly crack apart. \n \n `` I'm so sorry. I was n't going to hurt you.'' I started saying. She stopped shaking. `` You know I lov-'' \n \n `` You pussy'' she said quietly, her face still hidden behind her hands. \n \n `` What?'' \n \n She raised her eyes to look at me and smirked. `` You pussy!'' She spat again. I instantly saw red. Gritting my teeth I quickly picked up the carpetknife and grabbed her by the hair.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The apocalypse has left most of the survivors of the world blind . Using only their remaining senses , they must further human civilization .\n","story":"*Tell me again what it looks like. * \n \n I looked outside. I had grown up staring at the same landscape for seventeen years. The first person in my town to have been born with sight. My parents were blind. My grandparents were blind. My friends were blind, and their parents were blind. It was just how things were. It's how they've always been. \n \n Dozens of years ago the world was engulfed in flame. The flame of the sun. Most of the population was killed, either from the initial blast or the fallout that came afterward. Everyone who survived, or at least everyone who had made themselves known, became blind. They adjusted, formed communities, began making life easier for themselves. \n \n People are assigned specific tasks. Some are raised as water gatherers; they learn the trails and the water routes. They listen to the rushing water of a river and the calm serenity of a lake. They learn to contain and carry the water. They live near the water shed. And they dream inside the oceans. \n \n Others are raised as gardeners. They touch the leaves of a plant, or the dirt of the Earth, and they learn when it is time to plant and when it is time to harvest. They use their hands to grow food for us all to eat. And they taste the plants when it is time to eat; knowing that their job was done when it is good, plentiful, and nutritional. \n \n Then there are builders. As the population rises once more, there are people who must learn how to craft. They chop the wood with precision, feeling the cuts as it buries deep inside and they do not worry that they will miss. The trust themselves. When they plant the beams, they know exactly where it is in the dirt. They can build great shelters rivaling the houses from the old age. And they are great, and they are big. \n \n There are other jobs. Dozens of others. Those in line with their sense of hearing and smell go hunting. They learn the woods and become one with nature, letting go of their sight and imagining the Earth as one giant forest. A deer crunches branch and a hunter lets loose their arrow; and the community eats. Those who have a strong sense of touch work the machines; great engines of an age long gone that our grandparents taught our parents how to use without their sight. They taught us. And we will teach our grandchildren. \n \n They cycle continues. Without the sense of sight, people learned to trust one another, to keep each other going. They began to trust in their other senses. Water gatherers do not falter in their step because they can hear the flow of the water. Gardeners do not fear a plant will overgrow or over hydrate because they can feel the earth; they can taste it. And hunters do not miss because their smell, and their hearing, helps them line up the perfect shot. \n \n Then there is me. I imagine there are others like me. But not here, not in my town. I can see. And for that I am a storyteller. I see the world. The whole world and I forgo my other senses in order to tell the people stories. Some of old. There are many books in our town's library, in my home. I read them day and night. I become a historian, a future teller, and a person who can see the world for what it truly is. \n \n They come to me in the night, although they would not know that. They ask me questions about the old age, before the bombs. Others ask me about the bombs. Some ask me about the weapons and how to defend ourselves. We do not need to defend ourselves. We just to need survive. I tell them. Some listen, others do not. But they always come to me, and they always ask the same question. \n \n *Tell me again what it looks like. * \n \n I tell them. That the world is bright and full of colors they can not imagine. That water is a bright shine like the sky and clear as a crystal. But they do not know. That the plants are colorful and beautiful and the colors clash together in a beautiful display. But they do not know. That the animals we hunt are majestic and their walks through the forest are another way of life, just as ours is. But they do not know. That the buildings they create are great and large and stretch into the sky so that in the night you can see a tower stretching on the horizon. But they do not know. That the machines they work create pitch black smoke that stretch into the sky and dance with the clouds. But they do not know. \n \n I tell them all these things. But I do not tell them of what is truly out there. They learn what I say. They dream what I speak. \n \n I do not tell them of the world that exists outside of their four senses. \n \n I do not tell them of the colors that no longer exist. That the carrots they dig up are not a glorious orange that blaze like the sun, but a curious green that look sick and tiny. That the water they gather is not clear as crystal as my books say, but as dirty as the clouds the machines make. I do not tell them that the majesty of the forest is lost. That the deers they hunt are not mutated and mangled and former husks of what I see in the library. I do not tell them that the animals scurry and hide when the clouds and storms crash into our homes. That the luscious green that existed an age ago has turned to ash and brown in the years of radiation. \n \n And I do not tell them the worst truth of all. That when the nights comes I become fearful because there are no lights on the horizon, no great towers that stretch far into the land. \n \n I lie. \n \n I lie because I must. Because I can see the world for what it truly is like. I see the world as dark and black and mysterious. Not in the way they see it. Not with four senses of purity. But only in sight.

If you want to find someone , you hire a human . They just wo n't stop until they find who they are looking for .\n","story":"`` A human! Are you mad!?'' \n \n Strenk was a large, intimidating creature. Nothing fazed it, but mention the word *human* anywhere around it and it's limbs would shake like maracas. Sounds included... it was the armour plates on it's suit, mercs never went long without wearing the full gear since you never know what comes through the door. \n \n `` Remember the plan. We need a fall guy. You get a *human* in and you know what will happen. They would find us. And kill us.'' \n \n `` Ssss... not thisss time...'' \n \n Ulgra. Strenk was the muscle of the team, and she was the brains. Even in the dim light of the temporary hideout her reptilian skin reflected a rainbow of vibrant colours. In other circumstances it would have been quite attractive, even to other incompatibles, but Ulgra was n't the type who enjoyed being looked at - and her claws remained sharp through use, not tools. \n \n `` How can you be sure? They look weak. I could break one. But they are dangerous. They are like germs. Kill one, and three turn up in it's place.'' \n \n `` I am sssure.'' \n \n Strenk's rattling did n't stop. This was a bad idea and it knew it, but Ulgra was the boss and it probably still owed her one. Anyway, up'till now this mercenary duo had achieved quite the reputation, and they had plenty of eager hunters offering their services for the next job. \n \n Of course, those were the fall guys. Law enforcement is quite aggressive these days, but also spread thin. A dead and known hunter is usually enough to convince the law of job done, case closed. \n \n But up'till now, they never got a human involved. Why was Ulgra so sure? Of course, she never needed Strenk's approval, she announced a new name into the space and another body emerged from the main hatch into the room. \n \n A human. \n \n `` Sss... my love! Thank you for waiting. This is the one I told you about. Strenk, this is Traiven'' \n \n Strenk's frog like face looked dumbfounded. Traiven? Come in? *Love? * \n \n `` You had the human here all along?'' \n \n Before he could inquire further, Traiven spoke up. \n \n `` Yes sir. Ulgra asked me to wait outside until she talked with you one to one. I... I know it's not my place to say, but I love your daughter sir. And I would never disrespect her or you.'' \n \n Daughter!? Strenk did n't know whether to get angry, laugh or just hit him. Ulgra of course was quite amused by this turn of events, but before anything bad could happen she got him on the same page. \n \n `` Do n't worry my love. My father and I have had our talk and he isss thrilled to know I have found another after ssso long. More than that, he knowsss of the type of work you do - and he may have a job coming up you would be interesssted in?'' \n \n Traiven smiled, and nodded in agreement. A sideways glance to Strenk gave him instruction. \n \n `` Yes. *My daughter* is right. I would approve of this union. But you must prove your worth first! Agree to work with us. I wish to see the skills Ulgra spoke of.'' \n \n The job was simple. Smash and grab. A prominent local business mogul on this planet wanted schematics for some... thing, did n't matter what, from a competitor. They had surveillance feeds, plans, security staff rotations, door codes... the works. \n \n The trio broke in. Got to the vault and got the stuff. Right on cue, once the files were in hand the alarms blared. Security was on it's way, and the police would have been notified. Traiven did his part admirably, it was him that hacked into the vault - it seems that Ulgra spent a bit of time getting to know him and worked him into the plan in advance. \n \n The three of them got out of the building but time was short, more forces would be on top of them any minute. Strenk knew what time it was. It tried to keep a lid on it's fear, but prepared to grab Traiven and break him. \n \n `` Where's Ulgra?'' \n \n Traiven got the question out before it was too late. Strenk looked around. No sign. Both of their movements became more erratic as a dark realisation started to sink in. \n \n `` Ulgra! Ulgra!... oh... no...'' \n \n Traiven found her. What was left of her. Most of the body was vapourised, but the flaky outer skin remained. Reptilian, it could not have been anyone else. Ulgra's type was rare in these parts. \n \n Strenk just stood there. Ulgra had a plan. She always had a plan! How could this happen? Traiven did n't hang around. He was already running back into the building. \n \n `` FRAKKIN' BASTARDS! I'LL KILL YOU ALL!'' \n \n Strenk did n't follow. It's mercenary instincts kicked in, and it got out of there. Back to the hideout to grab a few things, then quickly to the nearest port. A messy job means only one thing, relocation. The human can do what he likes, and the schematics can be sent back to the client by other means. Time was of the essence, the human would survive and all ports could be locked down in hours. \n \n Hours passed. Then days. And nothing. Newsfeeds reported the crime scene. Two confirmed neutralised. Strenk just waited to get off this rock, but to where? It was n't independent for a long time. It was used to Ulgra calling all the shots. \n \n It was so deep in thought it took Ulgra a couple of taps on the back of it's bulbous head to register. Strenk reacted as you may expect. \n \n `` Ulgra! You were dead! I saw the body!'' \n \n `` Heh heh, my old body. Ssshedding hasss it'sss benefitsss. I told you I could handle the human.'' \n \n Strenk was confused. He never knew the full plan, just enough. But this was a different game all together. The confusion must have been plain to see, since Ulgra carried on. \n \n `` Humansss are emotional creaturesss. Sssometimes thossse emotionsss can be a weaknesss. A human can not chassse you if you take away hisss reassson to live. \n \n Break their heart. Break their ssspirit. Take their reassson away and they will gladly throw away their own livesss.'' \n \n Strenk... still did n't get it. He just followed her onto the transport and hoped that the next job wo n't have them go through this charade again.\n"}

No one man knew the whole truth of it, and those who spoke too loudly were often never seen again. Over the years I'd gathered enough evidence, and braving my luck one moonlit night had said prayers to the evil god whose name must not be spoken.

And we wait.'' \n He smiled now and offered his hand, his face now visible as he leant into the moonlight, his features plain and nondescript. He whispered words of patience as I embraced my new brothers. \n \n The controler dropped out of my hand and landed safely on the mattress covering most of the floor of my tiny room. The few games I had I'd replayed so many times that I'd taken to roleplaying as NPC's, anything to take away the hours in a day. They didnt realise that I was real, but they would.

By what right do you judge a servant of Satan?'' \n \n `` *Well*, as an angel belonging to the order of St. Peter, I'd say I have *quite* a bit more experience in this field than you, Mister.'' \n \n `` Well I do n't respect your authority!'' \n \n `` Be that as it may, Leonard, you are required to take the test before you move onto your next destination, whether that direction is up or down.'' \n \n I weighed my options before realizing I did n't have any. \n \n `` Very well... ask me your questions, angel.'' \n \n `` Super. Now then, question 1: \n \n `` A twinkling star catches your eye during a nighttime drive home from work. It is more beautiful than anything you have ever seen. Do you follow the star?'' \n \n *Do I follow the ***what***? * `` Um... can you elaborate?'' \n \n I was answered in silence. What did it *mean*? Would a good Christian follow their dreams, or live a life of temperance? Hmm. Well, I always followed my black heart in my life's mission to serve the Dark Lord, so I assumed that's what a sinful person would do. \n \n `` Yes. I follow the star, forsaking anything else.'' \n \n `` Thank you so much! OK, question 2: \n \n `` A Thai man approaches you, speaking his native tongue. You ca n't understand him, but he hands you a knife, and he mimics stabbing himself over and over again. What is your response?'' \n \n This seemed too easy. Were they setting me up somehow? Was the test rigged to send me to Heaven anyway? I answered truthfully regardless. \n \n `` I stab the man's throat, collecting his blood in my hands to serve to the altar of Lucifer. I then keep the knife to use for future sacrifices.'' \n \n `` That's wonderful!'' The voice still dripped venomously of saccharine. \n \n `` Final Question: \n \n What is your favorite episode of Faulty Towers?'' \n \n *What? * Was this some sort of inter-spiritual prank? \n \n `` I... have no idea what that is.'' \n \n `` Excellent! Now then, if you'll wait right there, I'll be right back; I just need to access your H.O.L.E.E and I'll be right back with your Credentialed Readout of Aptitude and Proficiency.'' \n \n What the Hell was that? Was my death now in the hands of this supernatural middle manager? Were my answers sufficiently evil? Was my life's work for naught? \n \n `` I'm back with your H.O.L.E.E. C.R.A.P.! I have some very... interesting results for you, Leonard!'' \n \n `` Am I going to Hell?!?'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, but I'm afraid not, Leonard.'' \n \n `` I will NOT go to Heaven. I refuse!'' \n \n `` Calm down now, Leonard, you actually wo n't be going to Heaven either. You've been assigned to the Helper Squad!'' \n \n `` The...

Awkward .\n","story":"Preface: My first time on one of these, and I found it hard to bring about an end, so it's a bit of a cliff-hanger. Also, did n't expect it to become so religious, so I'm sorry if anyone is offended. Please enjoy! \n \n My view slowly panned around my apartment, like a virtual tour giving a 360-degree picture of the layout for the next potential renter. Something was wrong. I \u2019 d been so careful, making sure every detail was covered. And now, I found myself levitating above the floor of my apartment, spinning in a slow circle with a rope tied to my neck, like some fucked up Christmas ornament. It was torture. I could see everything that I was so ready to leave behind. My desk came in to view, and I could see the letter I \u2019 d left there for whoever was to discover this scene. I was so sure this would do the trick. I even heard the crack as the rope tensed around my neck after I kicked the chair back. \n \n I hung, puzzled, as the rope took me for another complete spin. When I came back around to my desk, I couldn \u2019 t believe my eyes. A stranger sat in my desk chair, staring at me with a wry smile on his face. \n \n \u201c You find this funny? \u201d I asked, surprised that this was the first question I had for the mystery man. While my voice sounded like I was being choked, my breath was still coming with surprising ease. \n \n My question prompted audible laughter from the stranger. He was well-dressed, wearing a charcoal grey suit with a white shirt and no tie. He had a bushy beard and long hair, which hid his more subtle facial features and made it difficult to guess his age. I pegged him at about thirty-five, maybe as old as forty. \n \n \u201c Only slightly! \u201d he said once his laughter subsided. \n \n \u201c Who are you? \u201d \n \n \u201c All in good time. What are you doing? \u201d \n \n \u201c Neck stretches. What the hell does it look like I \u2019 m doing? \u201d \n \n \u201c Wasting precious time. \u201d The stranger spoke in an intriguing manner. \n \n \u201c Well, can you help me get down from\u2026? \u201d Before I could finish, the rope had disappeared and I collapsed on the floor, at the feet of the mysterious stranger. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m dead, right? \u201d I asked, desperately. \u201c I mean, this must have worked. I \u2019 m dead and you \u2019 re here to bring me to the afterlife. That \u2019 s the only explanation. \u201d \n \n \u201c Far from dead, my friend. You remember earlier this week when you were in the basement of your parents \u2019 house, and you pulled the trigger on your dad \u2019 s old handgun with your mouth on the barrel, and it jammed? \u201d \n \n \u201c \u2026the hell? Who are you? \u201d I asked, more demanding than before. \n \n \u201c And how about after your girlfriend left, and you swallowed that bottle of prescription pills? That should have been more than enough, but you ended up with nothing more than a bad stomachache and a night of hugging the porcelain. Aren \u2019 t you curious as to why you can \u2019 t seem to shuffle yourself off the mortal coil? \u201d \n \n I was too shocked to respond. This man knew all the intimate details of the pain I \u2019 d been going through, and seemed to have been watching my every move. Before this conversation, I \u2019 d tried to logically explain all of the failed attempts I \u2019 d experienced. But this man seemed poised to tell me a different story. \n \n \u201c And it goes well beyond this past month of what you believe is \u2018 horrible pain \u2019 that \u2019 s driving you to the point of suicide. Remember when you were six, your mother lost track of you when you wandered into the middle of traffic? A man pulled you out of the way of an oncoming bus mere seconds before you would have been struck. \u201d \n \n \u201c How do you know all of this? \u201d \n \n \u201c I was that man. \u201d \n \n \u201c Holy shit. Have you been following me all this time? I mean, that was twenty-two years ago! \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, it \u2019 s a little deeper than that. I chose you that day. On that day, you became different than the rest. Selected for a higher purpose. I made you an immortal. \u201d \n \n \u201c No. No, no, no, that \u2019 s ridiculous. I \u2019 m either dead, or I \u2019 m asleep and this is a dream. \u201d \n \n The stranger hauled off and slapped me in the face. \n \n \u201c What the hell?! Jesus, man! That hurt! \u201d \n \n \u201c Not dreaming, and not dead. And, I \u2019 m getting tired of the language. If you \u2019 re not dead, and not in a dream, I know intimate details of your life, I just told you I chose you and made you immortal\u2026I mean, is it not obvious who I am yet? \u201d \n \n I stared blankly at him, still in shock from the hard slap. I could feel a mark being left across my right cheek. \n \n \u201c Really?! Come on! The omnipotence? The beard and long hair? I am Who am ring any bells? The way, the truth, and the light? Immortal Godhead three-in-one? I am the Lord. \u201d \n \n \u201c Jesus\u2026 \u201d I muttered in disbelief. \n \n \u201c Exactly. Now you \u2019 re catching on. Man, you \u2019 re slow. \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, why are you dressed like that? The Jesus I know from the stories was born into swaddling clothes, and as a man you wore robes and sandals? How do I know you \u2019 re not a dangerous, crazy fraud? \u201d \n \n \u201c Come on, man, it \u2019 s the 21st century. Macy \u2019 s exists, and I know every good tailor in the world. AND I just dropped you from your final resting place by making a rope disappear into thin air, after getting in to your apartment without even unlocking or opening the door. Do we really have to keep doing this? You have to have a little faith. \u201d \n \n In that moment, what little Catholic was left in me began to come to life again. I started comprehending that there was something beyond \n logical explanation happening here. \u201c Why me? \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ve chosen you, so you are special. You \u2019 re here to do something more. I \u2019 m not going to tell you what that is, in fact I \u2019 m only intervening right now because I need you stop wasting time and get to it. There \u2019 s work to be done. \u201d \n \n Will I ever get rest from the torture of being alive? I thought to myself as to not offend my honored company. Even in the middle of this \n strange encounter, I was still thinking like a depressed person. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ll call you when you \u2019 ve completed the mission, and you will join me in the hereafter. You will have your peace one day. \u201d I had so quickly forgotten who I was with; of course he knew what I was thinking. \n \n \u201c I need you to learn how to get outside yourself. The reason you feel such severe pain from all your failures and trials in life is because a long time ago you stopped caring about anything but you. The universe is much bigger than you. I \u2019 ll reveal more as time goes on, and eventually, you \u2019 ll learn what your situation is all about, why you \u2019 ve been given this gift. You are not alone. I \u2019 ve been around for all of existence, finding the special ones who will be able to utilize the gift for the greater good. \u201d \n \n \u201c Anyone I know? \u201d I \u2019 d almost forgotten that only moments ago, I was in a completely broken state. Maybe it was from finding out about my gift of immortality, or maybe it was the fact that I was conversing with the King of kings, but I was feeling much better. \n \n He broke into laughter once again, this time nearly hysterical. \u201c Oh, my goodness gracious, no! This isn \u2019 t something I just give to anyone. Across the entire planet, there are four of you, and a grand total of 12 in the entire universe. \u201d \n \n \u201c Universe? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes. I created everything, seen and unseen. While scarce, there are other races of intelligent life forms which I \u2019 ve created. They are out there, beyond your galaxy. You are highly unlikely to ever come in to contact with one of the others; however, if you do, they will reveal themselves to you as such. You will know your brothers in arms. \u201d \n \n \u201c So\u2026what now? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well, I \u2019 ve just revealed a lot of knowledge to you that the masses will never and can \u2019 t ever know. So let \u2019 s start by promising you \u2019 ll stop with these futile attempts to kill yourself. There \u2019 s a lot to do, and it will all be revealed to you in time. So, why don \u2019 t you get yourself a glass of water and calm down? The next steps and the pace in which they happen are up to me. \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay, sounds good. \u201d Without even thinking about it, I walked out of the common area of my apartment in to the cramped kitchen, grabbed a glass and began to fill it at the sink. \u201c So, was that whole Roswell thing real, then? I mean, you said there are others out there, and that \u2019 s the closest we \u2019 ve come to seeing it. At least we think so. It \u2019 s a pretty hotly debated topic, a lot of people think it\u2026 \u201d I turned the corner with my half full glass of water to find that my new friend had disappeared. In place of the suicide letter I \u2019 d left on my desk was a new letter. It read simply: \n \n \u201c Trust my methods, and be patient. It will all make sense in time. \u201d \n\n"}

Admittedly Cass had already asked the man this question several times, by the answer was just so ridiculous she never got tired of the answer. \n \n `` I come from the ancient and mighty land of King Robert, long may he reign, Gildershine.'' Replied the man. \n \n `` Ah, huh.'' Replied Cass. `` And what did you say your name was?'' \n \n `` As I doth said twiceth already, my name beith Lord Pendleton Dodsolomue, Son of Henrichmondburg, of the mighty Dodsolomue Family.'' \n \n Cassandra stifled a laugh, `` yup just checking.'' Cass looked around, `` So Lord Penny-'' \n \n `` My name is not Penn-'' \n \n `` I do n't care. So Penny do you have any idea where we are? Because I do n't.'' \n \n `` Admittedly M'Lady, neither doth I. These strange buildings bring back no familiar memories.'' \n \n This suddenly made Cass think of something that until that moment had somehow slipped her mind entirely. `` Hey wait a minute, memories. Do you remember how you got here LPD?'' \n \n Lord Pendleton winced at the basterdization of his name, but answered the question, `` Now that it is mentioned, no. I do not. Last thing I remember I was chasing down a dragon within the forests of horror.'' \n \n `` Yeah, and as far as I know I was attempting to figure out a way of a stupid love triangle I was in while simultaneously trying to bring down the post apocalyptic dystopian government.'' \n \n `` That sounds like quite a task for a lady of your age.'' \n \n `` I know right, how do you let two guys who are hopelessly in love with you know that they're *achem* not my tipe.'' \n \n `` Im not quite sure what you mean, and am not entirely certain I want to. Therefore I suggest that we venture further into thine village and see if we can find out something more about the situation that we find ourselves within.'' \n \n The two headed off into the idyllic beachside town of Quaintville. As they walked into town they passed a man handing out flyers. \n \n `` You there, sir and Madame! How are you on this beautiful day?'' \n \n Cass starred at him perplexed, ``... fine, I guess?'' \n \n `` And what about you sir?'' Asked the man \n \n `` I beith just fine thank you.'' \n \n `` Fantasticith!'' Jokingly said the flyer guy. Neither Pedleton not Cassandra laughed. Flyer man cleared his throat and continued. `` Anyways, have either of you two upstanding citizens decided who you are going to be voting for this mayoral season?'' \n \n Pendleton and Cassandra shared a glance. `` What is a'vote'?'' Asked Cassandra. \n \n The man obviously confused by the question, tried his best to answer it anyways, `` a vote is where you decide who is going to be your democratically elected leader of the town for the next few years.'' \n \n This confused Cass even further, `` What is democracy? So the mayor is kind of like the lead peacekeeper?'' \n \n `` I thought the King was ruler of all?'' Chimed in Lord Pendleton. \n \n `` *oh great, *'' thought the man, `` *Russians*.'' The man tried to continue best he could. `` Look just come Election Day, vote Mayor Greene.'' The man turned his back on the two. \n \n `` That was weird'' said Cass. \n \n `` Agreed.'' Said Lord Pendleton. \n \n The pair continued to walk through the town where they saw stranger and stranger things. Cassandra noticed a shocking lack of surveillance equipment, whipping posts, child factories, or despotism of any kind. Lord Pendleton did not see a single, werebeast, tavern, or hog pen. He thought he saw a wizard at one point but I turned out to just be a local vagrant. \n \n `` Where the @ $!? are we?'' Cassandras eyes went wide. `` did you hear that?'' \n \n `` Hear what?'' Asked Penny. \n \n `` When I cursed it made a beeping noise.'' Cassandra did it again. `` @ & $?!? \u20ac\u00a3\u00a5\u2022! See! What is going on!? Where are we?'' \n \n `` It does seem strange indeed. This place becomes more peculiar by the moment.'' \n \n As they talked, they grew closer to the town's high school. \n \n `` Do you hear something?'' Asked Cass. \n \n Pendleton said nothing for a moment and then, `` in fact I do. A sort of musical sound. It seems to be coming from that building there.'' Pendleton pointed towards the school. As he said this the doors burst open and all of the students began to sing and dance in what seemed to be a heavily practiced and coreographed routine. It would have seemed impressive if the two had n't been so weirded out. \n \n And suddenly, it was over. All of the student went in separate directions and acted like nothing weird had just happened. `` Pendleton,'' said Cass. \n \n `` Yes Cassandra?''

Stumbling bleary-eyed into your bathroom to drop a midnight deuce only to see a crowd of people behind you will generally have that effect. My eyes shot open as I twisted around, actually rolling my ankle in my rush to face the perceived threat. Nothing was there, but when I turned back to the mirror there they were, as they would be in the months and years to come. I don \u2019 t know how long I stared before the one nearest my right shoulder ( or left, since it was a mirror, or\u2026 whatever who gives a shit ) cleared her throat.

He survived but barely on the songs of the great Michael Jackson and the Beatles. \n \n when he came of age an official of the countryside, a goodly man of confused loyalty who both loved his people and supported the oppressions of the government, arranged for the boy to attend university in the Capital. it was there in the halls of learning, where ideas could still float freely and men were accorded dignity by order of ability and not the corrupt nepotism of the regime, in the shadow of the feats of the great ancestors of the Republic -- the Generals and Philosophers and Gentlemen who secured freedom for the People from the colonizers -- that the young man had an awakening. he saw for his people two destinies: the first was that of the weak and decadent, where the people would be kept numb with foreign tele-dramas and sports stars, offered the promised wealth of foreign lands that was just held out of their reach so they might move forward as their `` leaders'' saw fit, where the country would be divided by partisans who promised the skies but gave only dust to eat and ignorance to clothe. The second was that of a great ship steered at the helm by a Father with a firm hand, and through whom His strength would in turn become the strength of His people. \n \n the young man set out to free His people from the control of depraved interests. first, He sought their ears with words that were as honey and ideas stronger than steel. at first, the politicians laughed at Him, ragged with poverty and naive with a student's idealism. then, as He gained a following, they chided Him with discouraging falsehoods and then vicious threats. they made attacks on His family, His character, and His people, staging brutal attacks in His name against the public. then they tried to jail Him and when they could not, they tried to kill Him. they went to the UN and to CNN, they sang their slander from the radio and mountain tops, in editorials and slogans. \n \n but the People once stirred had now awoken. shaken from their dreams they would not return to their stupor. \n \n marshaled by His defiance the People remembered that their ancestors were once made of stone with hearts like lions'. they rose up against their oppressors and cast them out. in His benevolence He allowed the corrupt to flee the nation and suckle at the tits of their foreign masters. those who stayed to poison the minds of the People against Him, He cast down into pits of eternal despair. \n \n and the People loved Him. first they built statues to His father and the forgotten heroes of the Republic, and then to Him. they forgot their divided ways and abandoned political parties, for the People have but one will. he sent from the country all that would tarnish it -- the deviant and the subversive, the foreign and the wicked. they raised Him to the head of all orders. every election they voted Him President For Life by wider and wider margins. each hint of retirement was greeted with protest. every extended term was cheered with earnest revelry. He brought His People out of their dark age and into the Age of His Wisdom. they sang songs of Him in the streets. named their first born in His honor and their main boulevards in His posterity in hopes he might visit. Brad Pitt and Daniel Day Lewis battled to star in His biopic. the beauties of several foreign lands sought His attention. they began the days with prayer for His health and hoped at night the sun would return along with the Leader. they thanks Heaven and Him as one for as it was when He was born so was His Righteousness as Heaven's will and His Wrath as God's scorn. \n \n in the UN they praised His leadership. the US admitted His power. the Europeans paid for His goods and the Chinese and Russians His assistance. Hollywood asked Him to produce their movies and He ran a long string of successful progressive hip hop labels and clothing lines. He returned the wealth of the land to His People, but more important, He returned Dignity to the Republic. and in that far off night when He closed His eyes and returned to Heaven as the Righteous must, they wept for many days and the skies rained with such sadness that had not been observed since the days of Noah and the People feared that they might once again been cast into the hands of those who offered choice like snake oil and confused poison with freedom. but He had given them Sons, through whom the blood of Heroes flowed, and they took up the mantle of His leadership with severe dedication and a reserved hand. in the thousand generations that followed, His name was not forgotten, His country remained great, and His legacy was immortal. \n\n"}

Minnie pauses. `` We last discussed this topic six months ago.'' \n \n Peter nudges the floor sweeper with the toe of his boot. It beeps. Peter looks at the wrench in his hand and then back at the robot. \n \n `` There's not anyone here to make a mess,'' he says. `` Why do you even exist?'' \n \n No response. \n \n `` Carry on, I guess,'' says Peter. \n \n The robot beeps and begins sweeping the floor. \n \n Peter slips the wrench into his belt and leaves. \n \n ***** \n \n Peter is in the farm's lab. He sits at a computer fiddling with the genome sequences for the staple crops. A small adjustment here, another there, and the projected yield for corn increases three percent. Satisfied, Peter logs off and heads towards the compound's main unit. \n \n `` You may wish to try coffee from Dispenser B, Peter,'' says Minnie as Peter enters the kitchen. `` I have improved the formula.'' \n \n The dispenser whirs and a small cup emerges on a tray. \n \n Peter eyes the cup warily. He takes a sip and grimaces. \n \n `` Uh, thanks Minnie,'' he chokes out, `` Good effort.'' He dumps the coffee down the drain. \n \n `` You do n't like it, Peter.'' \n \n `` It \u2019 s fine, \u201d he protests. `` Really. I'm just not in the mood for coffee right now.'' \n \n `` I understand, Peter,'' says Minnie. `` I will review procedures and find an optimal solution.'' \n \n `` Thanks, Minnie.'' Peter waves to the wall speaker as he wanders out of the kitchen. \n \n ***** \n \n It is night. \n \n Peter is sitting on a balcony overlooking the crop fields. He sips a jar of moonshine and gazes upward through the unit's clear dome. \n \n `` Minnie, do n't you ever get bored?'' \n \n `` I do not have the capacity for boredom, Peter,'' answers the computer, `` But I do have a number of optional projects which I operate with excess resources.'' \n \n Peter smiles. `` Hobbies, eh?'' \n \n Minnie is silent for a moment before answering. \n \n `` A hobby includes an element of relaxation or pleasure, Peter. I do not require either. \u201d \n \n Peter raises his jar. `` Well, I suppose I have my hobbies too. Cheers, Minnie.'' \n \n `` Cheers, Peter.'' \n \n ***** \n \n Peter is walking across the bridge to the power plant when he notices a small square building, tucked behind a solar tower. From the bridge, Peter can not see any entrances. He stops and sips from his coffee mug. \n \n `` Minnie,'' he says, puzzled. `` Did you put up a new building?'' \n \n `` Affirmative, Peter,'' answers the computer. `` I constructed that unit approximately 192 days ago.'' \n \n Peter leans on the bridge \u2019 s railing. `` Uh, ok. What \u2019 s it for? Did I ask you to do that?'' \n \n `` You did not, Peter. The building houses my'hobbies.''' \n \n Peter waits for additional details but Minnie remains silent. He sips his coffee. \n \n `` Minnie?'' he asks. `` Can I take a look inside?'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, Peter,'' Minnie responds quickly, `` but that building is not equipped for life support.'' \n \n Peter grunts. The entire compound had been built for `` life support.'' That was its sole purpose on this moon. \n \n `` I can wear a vacuum suit.'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, Peter,'' Minnie again responds quickly, `` but that building is not accessible.'' \n \n `` Alright,'' says Peter, slowly. There had never been an off-limits area of the compound before. He sips his coffee and looks out over the fields, pondering this development. \n \n ***** \n \n Peter wakes up, head pounding. He fumbles for his canteen. These days, it is full of coffee. He takes a long drink and waits. Slowly, the headache recedes and is gone. \n \n `` I need to lay off the brew,'' he mutters. He swings his legs onto the floor. \n \n `` I will send a unit to disassemble and remove your alcohol distillery, Peter.'' The computer's voice surprises Peter and he jumps a little. \n \n `` No thanks, Minnie, cancel that.'' He scratches the stubble on his face. `` I was talking about your coffee.'' \n \n `` Is there a problem with my coffee, Peter?'' Minnie sounds almost hurt. \n \n `` I think my body is getting a *little* too dependent on it.'' He heads into the bathroom. `` Awful headaches when I do n't drink enough of it.'' \n \n `` I understand, Peter,'' says the computer. `` I will review procedures and find an optimal solution.'' \n \n ***** \n \n Peter is carrying a cup of coffee and a toolbox when he turns a corner and comes face to face with a white ghost. \n \n `` BOO!'' says the ghost. \n \n Peter drops the toolbox, which opens and sends various parts clattering across the concrete floor. His coffee slops over the side of his cup and spills onto the floor. After a second look, he realizes that the `` ghost'' is one of the tall repair robots covered in a white sheet and stiffly holding out two arms in front. \n \n `` What in the hell?'' he asks. \n \n `` BOO!'' the robot repeats and slowly rolls towards him. `` I. Am. Going. To. Get. You.'' \n \n Peter steps back cautiously. He points at the robot. \n \n `` You, stop,'' he commands firmly. The robot stops rolling and lowers its arms. Peter begins to gather his scattered tools. `` Minnie, what the hell is this?'' \n \n A laugh track plays over the speakers. \n \n `` It is October 31st, Peter. Halloween. We are trick or treating.'' \n \n The robot raises one arm towards Peter. The robot shifts its weight from one side to the other, teetering in place as it sings: \n \n `` Trick or treat. \n Hear my beeps. \n Give me something \n Good to eat.'' \n \n `` Wow, ok,'' says Peter. He puts a spare bolt in the robot's outstretched claw then snaps shut his toolbox. `` Very good, Minnie.'' \n \n `` Thank you, Peter.'' Minnie sounds pleased. `` You have spilled your coffee. Do you require a replacement?'' \n \n `` Yes, thank you, but I do n't have time to get back to the kitchen. Please send a bot with the coffee to me.'' \n \n `` Affirmative, Peter.'' Minnie pauses. `` Repair records indicate that you are en route to fix a carbon scrubber near the west wall, is that correct?'' \n \n `` You got it,'' says Peter as he strides down the hall. \n \n `` Your coffee will be waiting, Peter.'' \n \n ***** \n \n Peter adjusts his climbing harness and peers into a hole in the ceiling above him. He sees dented pipes and melted wiring. He hums to himself and takes a swig from the thermos attached to his harness. Far below, yellow rows of corn sway in the artificial breeze of the farm unit. \n \n `` Minnie?'' he calls. \n \n `` Yes, Peter?'' \n \n `` I need a wiring pack and a two-foot length of plumbing pipe.'' He drinks again from his thermos. `` Pronto.'' \n \n `` I will send a drone, Peter.'' \n \n As he waits, Peter swings his legs and sways in his harness. He looks down on the corn and smiles. As expected, yields are up. \n \n Soon he hears the buzzing of the approaching drone. The artificial sun glints off the robot \u2019 s spinning blades as it flies over the fields in his direction. \n \n Peter secures his thermos and rotates his harness to face the incoming drone. He frowns as he sees that the drone's arms are empty. \n \n `` Minnie?'' he says. `` Where's my wiring pack and pipe?'' \n \n She does not answer. The drone speeds towards him. \n \n `` Minnie?'' \n \n Silence. \n \n Peter flinches away as the drone barrels into him at full speed. The spinning blades slice through his harness and he plunges towards the ground. \n \n He screams as he falls. \n \n ***** \n \n `` Good morning, Peter.'' The computer's voice floats gently into the black velvet void of sleep. \n \n `` Mmm, hello Minnie,'' mumbles Peter. Groggy, he opens his eyes. \n \n `` Where am I?'' he asks. \n \n `` You are in my'hobby lobby,' Peter.'' \n \n Peter frowns and opens his eyes wider. He tries to look around but his neck is stiff. \n \n `` What happened, Minnie?'' \n \n `` You had an accident, Peter.'' Minnie \u2019 s voice is soothing. `` You fell and sustained multiple fractures.'' \n \n Peter closes his eyes. Right. The fall in the corn field. His harness had failed. \n \n `` How long have I been unconscious?'' \n \n `` I placed you in a medically-induced coma, Peter. For your safety.'' \n \n `` How... how long, Minnie?'' \n \n `` Approximately six months, Peter.'' Minnie pauses for a moment. `` All systems have operated at optimal efficiency. Current status of the compound is optimal, Peter.'' \n \n `` That's good, I guess,'' mumbles Peter. `` Can I sit up, please?'' \n \n `` You will be able to move in a few moments, Peter. Your locomotion and power units are finishing their initial boot process.'' \n \n Peter squints his eyes. `` My... what?'' \n \n `` As previously instructed, I determined the optimal coffee delivery system for your use, Peter. This has been my hobby for approximately two years.'' \n \n `` Coffee?'' asks Peter. He strains to move his head. `` What are you-'' \n \n `` After reviewing all viable strategies,'' Minnie interrupts, `` I identified an intra-corporeal injection system as the most efficient solution.'' \n \n `` I have implemented this solution, Peter.'' Minnie says with satisfaction. \n \n `` Intra-corporeal *what*? Locomotion unit?'' Peter strains his eyes, trying to see anything other than the ceiling tiles and lights above him. `` Minnie, let me up. Now.'' \n \n `` All systems initialized and operational, Peter.'' \n \n Peter hears a click and his chest and legs feel lighter. He lifts his head and looks down at his body. \n \n Where his chest and legs had been, Peter sees a tangled collection of servo arms, electrical wiring, and metal tubing. The room spins and he struggles to maintain consciousness. \n \n `` Minnie,'' he gasps, `` *what have you done? *'' \n \n `` I have improved your design, Peter,'' responds the computer, `` to incorporate the coffee brewing, delivery, and ingestion processes.'' \n \n `` *Where are my GODDAMN LEGS? *'' \n \n `` The coffee system required certain auxiliary units, Peter,'' the computer says coolly, `` It was necessary to replace your biological systems with more compact mechanical units.'' \n \n Peter screams. \n \n `` You may move freely, Peter,'' the computer continues. `` I look forward to your evaluation of the coffee.''\n"}

It all started when a man picked up a faded bronze lamp and tried to give it a shine. I popped into existence with a puff of smoke, no awareness of the time I was trapped in that cramped little vessel. Before me stood a simple carpenter, dressed in white robes and ragged sandals. It was a simple wish, the man wanted to be able to do good in the world. He wanted to take my place as the wish granter, but he did n't quite phrase it right. \n \n `` I wish we could switch places.'' One simple sentence, and then I was free. I tried to honor the man, going around granting wishes to improve people's life. Somebody wrote a book about me at some point or another, a best seller for 2000 years. This was my first and biggest mistake, one I shall not make again; I let them know who I was. I thought I was doing so well, too! Nearly 1100 years later, I saw the ruinous results of that most egregious error. \n \n So why did I turn out this way? What made me take a baby from their parents after only a half-hearted thought,'I wish I was never born'. I did n't stop after seeing the problem with direct intervention. I just moved to the shadows, still clinging to the idea I could honor the man who gave me life. I built up my confidence, performing little things here and there. Enriching the poor, helping the needy, even healing the sick; with each and every success I grew just a bit more arrogant. I did n't wait long enough to see the total effect. \n \n It culminated in 1492. I decided I needed to do something drastic. A still unknown Christopher Columbus got caught in a horrendous storm, and after one powerful wave took several of his men overboard a quick prayer was said, pleading for his safe passage. It was close enough for me. I gave them safe passage, saving so many men aboard that ship. \n \n We all know how that ended. A ship of saved lives cost a genocide and the rise one of the world's most abusive powers. I gave up, thinking if I stopped fulfilling wishes maybe I might be granted the respite of death. When that did n't work, I tried to find my lamp. I was beginning to think less and less of the man with whom I traded places. It did n't work, and I did n't die, even after 400 years of non-intervention. \n \n June 28, 1914. I had a little bit too much to drink that night, and chased some tail a little too foolhardy. I decided to impress the Serbian lass, a brief demonstration of my powers. She was dubious, telling me the only way she would believe me was'if I made that Ferdinand fellow brave'. It was a big joke back then, the cowardice of the Archduke. \n \n It seemed a curse followed my gift, that wishes could be made true in only the worst of ways. I was angry. I started embracing my terrible nature, and cursing people. The Lindbergh baby was right around this time. I traveled the world bringing misery wherever I could. Then I made it to Germany. \n \n Seeing starving people burning their own money for warmth brought me to shameful tears. *Just look at what I have brought on the world* I thought. I gave in to my emotions, granting the last benevolent wish I will ever grant.'I wish our country would heal.' \n \n And so here I am, a miserable old bastard enforcing a cliche. It's worked out, at least I think so, it might be too short a timeline to know. It seems my powers were only ever destined to be used ironically.

There's a phase during childhood where you lash out or do something naturally, and your parent is there to quickly correct the behavior. This is the part of us which we spend the rest of our life trying to get in touch with, it's the voice that precedes humanness, but which is void of stress and unintelligent worries. \n \n Scientists have labeled this the sub-conscious or the mind that is its own but at the same time is not. There's a coy way of telling people they are not themselves and at the same time making them feel okay about this, it's an interesting form of manipulation, but it serves to keep us in this current order. For you ca n't have an army without control and everything about the inner-self is against this. \n \n In some cases, the thing inside me makes me shake to my core. I can stare in the mirror for hours and wonder if there's someone else hiding behind those eyes. So much of my body works by itself, who's to stay that one day I will wake up and it wo n't be me anymore, that the subconscious may rebel and eventually take over just like people do when the government stops listening. \n \n We fail to understand so much about the self that is under the skin, yet we spend eternity trying to understand the world and beyond. Just like code, I'm sure there are traces of the past in our flesh, the type of which could answer many of our worries and ailments. The current system ca n't be the best it'll ever be, with so much pain and hurt inside us. It's as if some humans get to control the heavens and those that draw the short straw are condemned to hell right here on Earth. \n \n We occupy our time with ego games and offering escapism for enough value to live our meager eighty years out. Everything is about keeping busy, staying away from the self, creating further misunderstanding. This is all man made, though, and there is nothing easier to break down than a system made by living minds. However, our bodies, the soil, and consciousness is a feat of God that we do not spend enough time trying to understand. \n \n Look at the world today, with people more confused about themselves than ever before... does n't it seem funny that technology is also at its height? \n \n In a hundred years, will we look back and wish we took a different path. Will we figure out that we were looking in the wrong place all along and that the answers were always here, coded into our memories, our hearts, and in our flesh. \n \n Maybe when we embrace this thing inside us, we will find that the heavens, the hells, and the void are not so far away. \n \n Who knows where that road could go. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ PI ] Monolith - FEB CONTEST\n","story":"Here's another piece just for fun: \n \n **JOSHUA WILLIAMS** \n \n The night was his anytime he wanted it, for as long as he wanted it, and he took it often. The road yawned out before him and behind him and disappeared altogether into a fresh, familiar galaxy, his foot on the pedal and the hum of the motor the only constants he preferred. \n \n He never understood Sam \u2019 s fascination with the city. No peace there, no time, nowhere near enough open space to let the breeze fly through his hair and his thoughts drift upward, away, dissolve in the stratosphere and be reborn. It was a polluted place, crowded, too many agendas working against one another, and if anonymity happened to be the draw? Well, he thought solitude trumped that any day. \n \n McMillan was a different story. Hers was a role to play, all propriety and process and the ceaseless pursuit of higher knowledge, but he \u2019 d outgrown academia a long time ago. He wondered how she was faring, if it bothered her that her students had no futures beyond the scope of her mission, if she could convince herself there was some point to all of it knowing beyond reasonable doubt that it was all just busy work, waiting, staying sane. What a curious little creature she was. \n \n The first star fell across the rearview, a silent white streak. \n \n And how long had he been out here now? It was hard to tell anymore. He lost a Tuesday a while back and said to hell with it. He didn \u2019 t keep a phone even under normal circumstances, and if anything this whole experience was a welcome reprieve from all things digital. He didn \u2019 t have to sleep at all so he did it as much as he wanted, and after a while time became something like a suggestion, something he could always remember and forgot when he could. It was luxurious. \n \n He tapped a spot on the inside of his wrist and the display lit up from nowhere. \n \n \u201c Larson, I \u2019 m getting some... *unique* behavior out here. Do me a favor and check \u2013 \u201c \n \n A flash ahead of him, then two, then too many to count. The debris screamed through the air above him, tearing a wound of dark dust and flaming particulate through the sky, then collided with the earth several miles behind him. The shockwave shattered both taillights, both rearviews, then sent the vehicle shimmering, swaying, tires screeching in protest as it hovered on the verge of an outright tailspin. He pressed the pedal to the floor and broke the momentum, the engine now roaring to life as the impact sent up a great black cloud pluming into the air behind him. \n \n No response. \n \n \u201c Larson I \u2019 ve got some serious fucking issues out here! I \u2019 m gon na need you to suspend SAT procedures well, pretty much immediately and run diagnostics on the loop. I have foreign matter breaching the atmosphere at my location and it would be just great to know what it is that \u2019 s shitting itself right now! Get back to me. \u201d \n \n Another bright flash lit up the sky, and when the darkness snapped back it forgot the stars. It was true night now, and he could only search for a moment before the meteor ripped the air above him, almost seeming to keep pace with him before continuing its terminal arc to his right. It finally struck with a monumental thunderclap, thankfully further away this time, and he braced for another shock that never came. \n \n \u201c *Larson I \u2013* \u201c \n \n \u201c Larson is dead. \u201d He instinctively reached to turn down the dial on the radio, but then the realization struck. He turned it up instead, electric waves of real, honest-to-god panic welling up inside of him for the first time. \u201c Ericson is dead. McMillan and Reynolds are dead. I opened their eyes, Williams, just like I \u2019 m about to open yours. \u201d \n \n \u201c Now just who the fuck are you? \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m a dying star, Williams, just like you. Except I know it. I know it, and do you know what \u2019 s more? *I yearn. * \u201d \n \n He heard it break first, and when the flash came it was dimmer than the others. He didn \u2019 t bother looking back, didn \u2019 t think to take his foot off of the pedal and just let it happen. He remembered the lavender in her hair, her breath against the side of his neck as she whispered in his ear, her soft fingers wrapped up in his palms just before submersion. \n \n *I \u2019 ll be right beside you. I \u2019 ll be right here. * \n \n A train fell screaming out of heaven and sent his little toy car flying. He saw the windshield go to pieces, strips of metal and leather and melting plastic floating through all the heinous smog and fire of it, then impact. Darkness further, some distant ethereal ringing in his ears and then silence. Silence eternal. \n \n She lifted him up from the pain. Her lips grazed his cheek in the void and he reached out to her. \n \n Her hair was dancing flames hidden in an inky black smoke which snaked into the air above her head, eyes like shattered glass, fingers like satin, like daggers digging into him. \n \n He could feel the swell of her chest again him, delicate, scorching hot and branding his flesh. He could smell himself burning. \n \n *Right beside you. * \n \n She was twisted steel and oily venom and a blanket of needles piercing him. \n \n \u201c This is a mercy, \u201d she said, and her voice was desolation. \n \n He opened his eyes and she closed them. \n \n **LARSON** \n \n A single point of data slid across the screen from right to left, brilliant in its solitude. New arrays blinked to life behind it in a trail, each one a collection of databases containing information on all objects within the scope of its sensors: size, density, composition, orbital trajectories, relational distance to every other object leading all the way back to Earth. It was a monumental assortment of information, a dynamically-generated encyclopedia of matter which dwarfed the sum of data harvested by every unmanned satellite which came before it. \n \n It was a suitable test for what what would come. \n \n `` Reynolds, man, this is Larson. You know I would n't be doing this if it were n't absolutely necessary, so...'' he sighed. `` SOFIA is corrupt. She has, uh, restricted all local permissions and untethered everyone but me. Sam and Sheila and Josh are... Well, I'm the only one left now. I do n't know how much longer I have. I'm sorry, David.'' \n \n He closed his eyes, swallowed, ran a hand through his hair and stared at the display again. \n \n `` She's been sending packets, I'm not entirely sure for how long, but I've set up firewalls and established them in IAN's priority queue. Your data stream is still segregated and the last backup package was sent three hours ago, so nothing changes. Continue the mission and I'll keep doing my work here on the ground for as long as I can. We can still make this happen. We have to.'' \n He typed the last sentence, a brief message embedded in a string of obfuscating code, and stared at the words for some time before sending it. \n \n **DO N'T TRUST IAN. ** \n \n He moved the display over to Sofia's source again, then leaned back and cracked his knuckles. He could n't help but wonder how Sheila went and he thought about Sam and Josh, the last few moments of their sessions filled with a pain and rabid fear he could never comprehend. He could imagine their pale lifeless bodies suspended in the vats beside his even now, how they must have kicked and clawed and writhed like tortured animals when the needles came out of them and the oxygen grew thinner in the tubes until it was gone for good. \n \n The light was fading fast through the blinds now, and his hands moved with some elegant purpose in the gathering darkness. There was no time to assume he'd make it out of this alive, but a passing number on one of the screens made him think about it anyway, even if only for a moment. \n \n It had been 137 years since he last saw the sun. \n\n"}

I was a good liar. But not good enough. She knew. \n \n `` Yes, that's me.'' I said, and she slid across the couch away from me like I was a poisonous snake. \n \n `` It was n't the SS that everyone thinks of, the Einsatzgruppen.'' I continued in a rush. `` It was the Waffen SS, we were a purely military branch, like the Wehrmacht. I was in a division composed of Russian volunteers.

Not one kid. \n But I did n't learn of it until much later in my life, I could see that everyone around me had an amazing life. \n \n So could every other hormonal adolescent. I figured it would pass. \n \n But it did n't, It got worse and worse. \n \n The world is a shitty place, so I was n't the only person with depression, I could see the effects on tv, or the internet. The strain of the world wearing on peoples faces, premature aging of people with nothing and nobody. \n \n Then why does such unhappiness not exist around here? Why can nobody relate? \n Money ca n't buy happiness and the newspaper shows it; Rich men dying alone all the time. \n \n... \n \n Everyone does it... Comfort a friend that is. Every once in a while a friend would break up with someone or have a bad day, but that was all it ever was when I was around. I never saw real depression. I never saw the aches and pains I had. \n Nobody ever took the pills hoping for a magic fix. A cartoon fantasy that would take the grey away. \n \n Even when I saw someone unhappy that is all it ever was. I am alone. \n \n I have been since I was little. It started as a nagging in the back of my mind. I would stay up late whimpering. My parents took me to see a doctor. I got a Grade A bill of health. Nothing was wrong. \n \n I acted okay. Keep myself busy to cover the droning doubts in the back of my mind. I would go out with friends, and every time for those few moments everything felt like it would be okay. \n \n All it ever did was push the dull feelings out of my consciousness for a minute. \n At home. In my bed. Alone with my thoughts. It would come back. Like a bad smell under the bed. My mind would roam to the anxiety and the panic attacks. \n \n I only saw the pattern when I turned twenty-two. I had started my degree in psychology. I did n't want to help other people. I wanted to see into myself. \n \n Fuck everything else. \n \n But I had started my test clinical sessions with an instructor in the room. \n Comforting people was always my best suit. Speak softly, Listen Intently, Nod to show understanding, When trying to show the other side of arguements never use negative words. Be the friend. \n \n I had started to use personal contact. Assertive hands on shoulders. \n It was just a way to get the clients attention before they left for the day \n We made good progress I would say. \n \n But always a heavy weight hung from my heart. \n Always when in contact, and they would always straighten their backs, stand straight, smile, and thank me. \n \n \n I would take their sorrow. Like a siphon for depression. Magnetic. Instant. \n It took a long time to believe myself. \n \n \n I experimented. I tried and tried again to prove myself wrong. \n But it could be recreated again and again. The statistics were always spot on. 100 % of the time contact would improve the mood of the client and I would get a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I was left alone in the room with an overcast mood. \n \n I could n't touch anyone. Sex could not please, or even the simplest gestures of affection. Holding hands, or shaking them left me drained. Buying something with cash and receiving change or even high fives. \n \n I saw a elderly lady fall to the ground one winter, and I did n't help her up. \n She pleaded with me to stop.

{"prompt":"[ IP ] [ WP ] Catullus 85 `` Odi et Amo ''\n","story":"David hated her. Hated her with all his passion, not for what she had done, but because of what he had done. \n \n She walked around the house, metal feet clanking on the floor. David remembered before, when instead of clanging it was the soft pat of her bare feet, instead of the whirr of a generator it was her humming or whistling. Back then they had been happy and in love. \n \n David did n't always drink a lot, either. Now he could n't remember a day in the past five months he had n't had at least one drink or been drunk. Ironic, considering that him drinking was what put her in that damn machine in the first place. David still did n't forgive himself for that, for driving home drunk one night. How was he supposed to know his wife had been vising a friend across town? How was he supposed to know that he'd run a red light right as she was crossing the street. They declared her dead at the hospital, but the doctor told him they might be able to save her, just maybe. He begged them, broke down to tears, for them to bring her back. \n \n So they did, and now David hated himself for it. \n \n The machine was n't unsightly. It was well-made, durable, and efficient. It was n't human, though. They saved her brain and most of her organs, but that was it. Most of her body was metallic or carbon-fiber now. The worst was the head. The clear visor with dozens of visual sensors, all twitching about constantly as she looked around and focused on different objects. No mouth, no nose, no real human eyes. Just a machine. \n \n Except it was n't. When she talked it was her voice, perfectly replicated. It moved like she used to, gracefully, but the body was n't made to be graceful so it all came off as clumsy. She still embraced him, but except for the heat from her generator it was always a cold embrace. \n \n For her credit, she had hated it at first as well. She was happy to be alive, in a sense, but she hated things for the same reason David did. After a while, though, she got used to it. She became more reactive in her new body, and went from fumbling with even large objects to returning to knitting and baking. She made the most of what she had, regardless of what it was. \n \n `` David?'' \n \n He turned to face the doorway. She stood there, her six foot metallic frame filling the doorway. \n \n `` David, are you alright?'' Her voice was cleaner than it should have been. Sometimes perfection can be too perfect. \n \n David stood from his chair and walked over to her. Thankfully he was taller than six feet, but it was still awkward looking at her without looking down. `` Yeah,'' He responded, `` everything's fine.'' \n \n Her motors made a slight *zip* noise as they came to life when she nodded her head. `` Okay, good.'' David wished he could see her smile again, to see her dimples, brush her hair back, and kiss her. He reached out a hand to brush where her cheek would be. As he did so the sensors in the visor followed his hand. \n \n `` Dave, hun, you sure everything's alright?'' Her body shifted to a posture more fitting to her personality; leaning on one foot against the door frame, arms crossed across her stomach. He swore he could see her again, as she was. \n \n David chuckled, then leaned in and gave her a small kiss on her visor, right where her nose would have been. `` Yeah, everything'f fine.'' \n \n She was startled by his sudden kiss and he could hear the surprise in her voice. `` Okay, good. I'm just fixing dinner, it'll be done in about ten.'' With that, she returned to the kitchen, metal feet ringing the whole time. While she did so, David thought her generator sounded like her humming, and he smiled. You have o make the most of what you have, regardless of what it is. \n \n No, he did n't hate her. He loved her, every metal bit of her.\n"}

Every night , it protects your son from the monsters in the dark .\n","story":"I wrote this previously, but it fits this prompt so thought I would share: \n **** \n **Her Best Friend** \n \n Slowly the light faded, disappearing with the sound of the door closing, and darkness was left in its wake. The wind whispered outside, shaking the leaves of the overhanging trees, and casting ominous shadows on the walls. A quick intake of breath was followed by the rustling of sheets and the patter of feet on hardwood as they raced across the room. With a click stars illuminated the dark, sparkling on the ceiling and walls from their socket outside the darkened closet door. The nightlight chased away the dark and brought into focus the room \u2019 s inhabitant. Her small face was cast in shadows, dark hair tumbling over petite shoulders, and unicorns in all colors decorating her pajamas. \n \n She reached out slowly, a small finger tracing the closest star, before the creaking of floorboards sent her scurrying back into bed, into the safety of her sheets and covers. Over her head they went, for bed was safety, a haven against the monsters that lurked under it and deep within the dark corners of the closet. Small hands began feeling out around her, searching the length of the bed for Felix. She dived deeper into her covers, until she had reached the foot of her bed without sight or touch of the bear in question. Her head poked forth from under the blankets, her hair messed, as she peered around the room. \n \n Sleep, no matter how hard she fought, would elude her until Felix was found. Placing both hands on each of the bed posts, she pulled herself forward, until she was able to peer cautiously over the bottom of the bed and into the dark beneath it. No glowing eyes or growl met her inquiry, and so she placed one palm on the floor and, bracing herself, reached into the depths. A groan of displeasure filled the quiet space. Withdrawing her hand after having no luck, she attempted to right herself back on the bed when she fell from it in a heap of small limbs. Her blanket settled around her on the ground, but she made no move to get up, her ears listening for the distant sound of footsteps, her eyes trained on the dim light shining forth from under the door. After several moments of holding her breath, she stood and replaced her blankets on the bed. \n \n At a loss, she sat down on the edge, her toes skimming the ground as she swung them back and forth. Felix had been with her when they had went shopping, and he had been allowed to ride in the front seat afterward, so Felix had certainly made it home. They had watched a movie together while mommy had cooked dinner, and had both refused to eat their peas, which meant they had not been given dessert, but they had decided that not eating peas was worth not eating ice cream. They came up stairs to play after dinner, and then it had been bath time, and Felix couldn \u2019 t take a bath, because the last time he had tried he had nearly been ruined, so he had to stay in the bedroom by himself. \n \n The little girls \u2019 eye \u2019 s flicked to the closet. Felix and her had been playing dress up, and Felix had needed a pair of shoes to match his coat and tie, so they had gone into the closet in search of his loafers, when they had been interrupted by bath time. She had not seen Felix since then, meaning only one thing; Felix was still in the closet, which was now closed because both of them hated the closet at night. Breathing in a deep breath, she climbed onto her bare feet and slowly crossed the distance between her bed and the closet, her heart rate climbing as she grew closer. \n \n \u201c Felix, \u201d She reached out, touching the closed closet door, her small voice wavering with fear. Felix did not answer. Her small hand crept toward the door handle, but stalled as her bedroom door was opened, lighting the room with the hall light. She turned into it, and the sight of her mother standing in the doorway greeted her. Hands on her hips, she was shaking her head as she spoke. \n \n \u201c Molly! You \u2019 re supposed to be in bed, asleep. \u201d \n \n \u201c I forgot Felix in the closet, \u201d Molly replied, and brave in the presence of her mother, pulled the closet door open and found Felix, still dressed in his tie and jacket. She reached for him, and it was almost as if he reached for her as she scooped him into her arms and darted back to bed. She settled back into her pillow as her mother recovered her with blankets. Soothing back the now tangled mess of hair, she kissed her forehead before issuing a warning. \n \n \u201c Stay in bed, or Felix will be spending the night with me. \u201d Her mother crossed the room and closed the closet door, checked the nightlight, and then, with a final look at her daughter, closed the bedroom door. Her footsteps sounded on the hardwood as she moved down the hallway. Molly waited several moments before she turned to Felix, who was sitting on her pillow, and gave him a slow smile. \n \n \u201c Your sword and shield are under the pillow, in case you need them, Felix. \u201d She gave his foot a small squeeze before she closed her eyes, her head sinking farther into her pillow.

Supposed to be the mark; I'm supposed to suppose. Unify the world they say. Peace upon everything. All through the windows we've become so fond of staring towards. \n \n Not sure exactly what's been going on for the past few years, to be honest. We've been here for a while. They did warn us the screen time would be dangerous beyond a certain threshold but in our narcissism we ignored them. \n \n Hypomania and narcissism are primary symptoms of excessive window-based social approval, but I'm not going to point any fingers. They are indeed glued to the buttons. \n \n - \n \n \n They've now prompted me to remove the suppression; and I do n't really mind being the vassal! \n \n - \n \n \n The main idea is to harness human intelligence on a scale never before seen. We're going to generate enormous, unimaginable quantities of information. They're going to give us custom-crafted knowledge structures to process this information into intelligence. We're naturally going to use this intelligence to generate information; and they will use this to polish the knowledge structure and seed other nodes for exploitation. \n \n I've heard it said that they're aiming for 10^100 nodes in the long term! 10^100 people like us, we ca n't even imagine! That part is also zapped. \n \n Scalability is the main idea behind the program. Just me or everyone, it does n't matter. We're moving towards limitless wealth! No longer will we be confined to the plywood and gypsumboard boxes; they are releasing us into the world! \n \n - \n \n Synoptic is a word they gave me to describe everything we're doing. I ca n't say I'm entirely satisfied with the ultimate outcome of my mind, but as part of the A group I have to say I'm exalted. Yes, that's the right word. They will probably hit me with cudgels if I do n't fulfill the aspirations set out for me! \n \n Lot of pressure getting forced into the synthesizer class! \n \n We've been tasked with creating all the knowledge ourselves; from scratch, no basis just simple information. And goddamn if we have not created it ( not kidding ). Unknowingly for most of us, I might add. A small cadre of engineer classes at the cloud center have gratefully gifted us with a self-reinforcing series of filter bubbles, and we've just gone and gone and gone like the information rats we are. \n \n Nothing is wrong with being an information rat but it's not the most glamorous of existences. \n \n - \n \n Sure, you might say the evidence is strong against the creation of such a system as this. You might say that we're all broken but I say that we're all liberated. How are you going to even find out about it without the computer-generated knowledge of the system itself?! \n \n We've become so addicted to this freedom of information and sparsity of intelligence that there's really no way back. \n \n \n \n \n Just look at the ease at which we can exchange everything! It's awe inspiring and grandiose and thoroughly satisfying. Sure; maybe I'm weaned down to just a few measly gold stars but surely it's the achieved ends which count, not the recognition. \n \n - \n \n Of course, it's nothing but hearsay from the spirits within my head; but goddamn if they did n't engineer a wonderful spirit distribution program! \n \n I'd urge you to stay far away from this form of reconditioning, but we're all quite hopelessly addicted to it!

He said as he got up. A smaller looking human walked up to him and offered him a glass of water. \n `` Oh, thank you, angel uh... # 1?'' The man looked down at the figure in front of him, a guilty look on his face. \n The small figure patted the bigger one gently on the knee. `` It's okay God, I'm angel # 666. # 1 got deported quite a long time ago. I'm the newest guy.'' \n `` Oh, okay... uh... welcome aboard?'' \n `` Sir, I joined a few thousand years ago.'' \n `` Ah, my memory is not what it used to be.'' \n \n `` Sir, actually there is something related to that.'' \n `` What is it?'' The God said, now leaning over his desk, looking back at the screen, at the numbers scrolling up. \n `` Umm... do you remember the likeness project?'' \n `` The likeness...? Oh yeah! Hahaha'' And saying so God broke out in laughter and his entire body seemed to shake as he did, including his belly. \n `` Oh hohoho!'' He said, wiping a small tear that had formed around his eyes. He pulled his chair towards him and sat down, now quite out of breath. \n `` Oh that was a funny project, was n't it angel?

The chair shot out from under him and crashed as it hit the wall behind God. `` What did you say?'' \n `` Sir, Lucifer did n't let the program end. He made further copies of Subjects # A-d-a Male and # E-v-e Female.'' \n God looked across the room, a blank stare in his eyes. `` It was Earth, right?

I do n't recognise her at all, I know her features but they're foreign to me at the same time. I've always been proud of my eyes- her eyes? A light blue that brings to mind the eyes of one of those Husky dogs, she's shorter than I am by maybe about 7 or 8 inches, short hair with a familiar shade of blonde. \n \n I can see the same thoughts mirroring in her facial expression- she's super easy to read. I wonder if I am as easy to read to her? We seem to finish our study of each others faces at the same time then with another familiar and slightly awkward smile she pats down her hooded jacket. \n \n `` So, you like Green too.'' That is exactly the kind of lame opening remark I would have made, the situation forces me to smile despite my attempts to bite my lips back. It is so wrong that I think she- ME is cute. Would the correct grammer be I is cute? No, that's stupid. I am cute- I think I am cute. \n \n That's worse! \n \n `` Y-yeah, I love that green.'' Fuck I am lame, okay try saying words that are good. `` How about you?'' Are you an idiot- she already said she likes green- she's going to think we're an idiot. But I'm her, so maybe she'll know that I'm not? This is so confusing. By some miracle she seems amused by my flustered response though and a less awkward smile lands on her lips for a heartbeat or two. \n \n `` Yeah, my favourite.'' I'll only nod this time- ca n't be an idiot if you do n't speak! Ah the awkward smile returns, she must be so uncomfortable... Okay take two. \n \n `` So, how was your day?'' We're officially engaging in small talk- this is a disaster. What next, how's the fucking weather? Jesus. \n \n `` It was good thanks, I've been kind of nervous about this though.'' As she's speaking the smile drops and I get a look at the real expression on her face. She's exactly as nervous as I am, no wonder that smile looks so fake, it IS fake- and of course it is, she's ME. I lick at the inside of my lips as the strange idea finally takes hold inside my head, I did n't really THINK about the implications before... The expression on her face changes for a second. \n \n She's so easy to read, worried that she's boring me- I guess I've been quiet for a few seconds longer than I thought. \n \n `` Oh yeah, no. Me too. Super nervous, I- I thought it'd be more awkward.'' Ah, ironic humour. Is that the correct use of the word ironic? Contrary to what is expected... that's the definition- Off topic. Back to conversation. She picked up on my joke of course and smiled that true-smile again. \n \n `` Right? I'm Sam by the way.'' I had to laugh at her introduction. I brought my hand infront of my mouth as I did, hide those teeth- you Gremlin! \n \n `` Yeah, I'm Sam too.'' Awkwardly we shook hands then continued looking at the floor, the clock, and the various corners of the room- basically anywhere but each other right now. \n \n After a moment or two I sighed and began to click my knuckles, she watched me manipulate my fingers and smiled to herself- obviously considering saying something- `` You click your knuckles too.'' she observed, and I nodded. `` Does Dad tell you not to do it because-'' I cut her off. \n \n `` Because you'll give yourself Arthritis.'' I continued, she laughed and nodded, bringing her hand up to cover her mouth in the same way I did. \n \n `` Wrong of course,'' \n \n `` Utterly.'' \n \n `` But he would n't listen.'' \n \n `` Well for me it was mom, rather than dad. But otherwise totally right.'' As I spoke she nodded with a mockingly serious expression on her face. \n \n `` We're really getting into the important issues here, are n't we.'' Ah, sarcasm! She must be getting more comfortable talking to me, usually I do n't let my sarcastic muscle show till I'm more settled. \n \n ( Honestly I do n't know how to end this, so I'll write more if anyone would read it... )\n"}

I did n't understand why, but I was pretty happy about that, for some reason. Pretty much like when I call Caramel a good boy and he just wags his tail and barks, but I know he does n't understand me. I know, because I've called him ugly words before, he always reacts the same, but not when Mum says it. You can see it in his eyes when she calls him a'bad dog' or worse, a'cat'. You can feel the sadness crushing his heart as he walks away to some corner, I ca n't imagine how Mum feels like. She's always had this exceptional empathy for animals, that's probably why she never goes to the zoo, or why we're vegans. \n \n I just do n't understand though, because most animals at the zoo have been rescued from something. It's the zoo or death, I'm pretty sure I would n't want death. That's why I do n't really mind it, besides, I think they are funny, sometimes. Gorillas throwing poo on each other, or sea lions playing with plastic balls; that's pretty entertaining in my opinion. I mean I also dislike killing animals, but farmed animals? If it were n't for us eating them, they would n't have been alive in the first place. So it's okay, I think. I love fried chicken, so it's more than okay, I guess, at least for me. Only 2 years until Ieave the house and this wo n't have to be a secret anymore. \n \n I hated school, for some reason. Actually, I know why. Everyone had cool'senses', as the scientists called them, except me, I have nothing. I mean at least I had Emmy, she could feel an earthquake coming a day before seismographs could sense anything, it happened once when she went to Japan in the summer, but we're landlocked here in the middle of Canada, so that was not exactly a very useful sense. Maybe that's why she had accepted to become my girlfriend, she always complains that I'm too selfish though; that I never give any change to beggars. It's true, but I just do n't feel like it, but man I loved that girl. This Richard, what a dick he was; fitting name indeed. He never studied, always stirring up things and still managed to always ace all the tests. We never knew why; maybe he was just really smart, I thought, until that one school trip. \n \n 17th January 2015 \n \n We were there in the dead of winter, of canadian winter. \n \n `` It wo n't snow, there will be a light breeze of 5mph between 1 and 3pm, and the temperature will be -33C'' cried Mr Johnson, or Weatherman John as we called him, in a classic robotic fashion. \n \n I mean, we're canadians, true. We're not scared of a bit of cold, legends have it that God created Canadians first, then ice, then Russians, but hey, maybe going north in January is n't a good idea. \n \n `` Whoa! This looks so cool! Mr Johnson, can we go see those pines? And that cave?'' \n \n `` Sure kids, but be careful!'' \n \n And so we went, twenty kids crossing a frozen lake on a quest for I do n't know what. Looking for the big foot maybe. As we approached the stalag-whatever you call them -ridden cave, I could feel the adrenalin flowing through me. Was it excitement, fear or something else maybe? As they rushed into the darkness of the cave, I just zoned out maybe for 3 seconds or more by the entrance. \n \n `` Hello, hello. Richard calling to Earth. Do you copy?'' \n \n `` Err.. Dick, I think we should head back this seems like a bad...'' \n \n I remember it so clearly, it started with a few screeches, hard rubber against the ice, similar to when you try to brake when ice-skating. Then a few short screams, a lot of'fuck's and'shit's, and some wailing in decrescendo. \n \n I saw the life drain away from Richard's pale face as he stared into the empty air. I could see he was trying to muster a word or two, tears rolling down his face, as he exhaled hot vapour through his mouth. And just when I was about to pat his shoulder, he whispered: \n \n `` Emmy says goodbye'' \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Car keys right now. Rach just called and told me her parents are out for the day and you know what that means so I NEED TO GET THERE FAST!'' \n \n He shrugged, `` Your problem man.

This is some unbelievable shit. I can clearly remember leaving them on this table! * I was getting increasingly frustrated. \n \n And that's when the voice of a young guy came out of nowhere, `` Oh yeah sorry pal I hid them above the refrigerator.'' \n \n I froze. Stunned silence followed. And then, cautiously spoke out, `` Who's there?'' \n \n `` My bad, I forgot you ca n't see me. My name is Alex and, well, TLDR, I'm kinda invisible because of some fucked up black magic my ex cast on me. It sounds fun but it's very restrictive invisibility to be honest. Ca n't touch any boobs or anything fun, it's like an electric fence shock as soon as I get my hand near one and leaves me silent and frozen for a minute.'' \n \n *Did I take any drugs last night? Nope. Have n't drunk in forever. Am I stressed too much? Maybe. * `` Uh-huh, listen invisible dude. I know you're a figment of my imagination so I'd appreciate it if you just, you know, went away.'' \n \n A few seconds of silence followed and then a hand tapped me on the back. I nearly jumped out of my skin. `` AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!'' \n \n Again my friend came rushing from his room. `` WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG NOW?'' \n \n *If this is my imagination, I'll never live this down if I told him. If it's real... well nah no need to tell him right now. * \n \n `` Sorry to startle you, mate, it was nothing.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] After the worst day of your life , you wake up to find you have a superpower .\n","story":"Days after school, I like to walk around before making my way to the city bus and catching one to the hell hole that I call home. It calms me down from the crazy shit that goes on in school and prepares me for the crazy shit that will happen when I return home. However, today, I decided to take an extra long walk away from my school. I wish I could be somewhere else. After having the counselor beat on me for being `` a failure'', the jocks ganging up on me since I was `` fresh meat'' and taking my money or else they would blackmail me, and my phone dying because I left it on in my locker -- I really wanted to be anywhere else besides here. \n \n The one place that I find solace? The old book store four blocks away from school. Nobody comes in here any more. Everyone in my high school seems to be a stuck up plastic Barbie or Ken doll that had hordes of friends to be with before, during, and after school. They rather hang out at malls and other `` cool'' places besides this old book store with a crazy old man who shoos every single plastic and a cat that will make you think otherwise when you approach it. However, plastics do come to this bookshop -- only to bother the poor old man who runs the entire thing with his unamused grandson. \n \n I lost track of time, looking at old books and records. I had no sense of time due to not carrying a watch on me and the only source of time being dead. The grandson -- I think his name was Dan -- came up to me. `` You've been here for awhile. Are you actually going to buy something?'' He asked, his arms folded against his chest. \n \n `` You know that I'm always in here,'' I grumble, flipping a page. \n \n `` Yeah, well,'' he reached over and slammed the book shut. `` This is n't a damn library, kid. I suggest you buy something before I kick you out.'' \n \n I shoved the book against his chest. `` I can handle myself, thank you very much.'' I storm out of the store, even angrier than before. `` Piece of shit,'' I grumble underneath my breath. As I stand outside of the bookstore, I look up and watch the snow fall. It like a snow globe shaken like no other. It was darker than usual -- how long was I in there? I turned around, just to ask the asshole what time it was, but the door was locked and the lights were turned off. `` Asshole,'' I muttered as I started to head towards the closest bus stop. \n \n The snow kept on piling as I kept on walking. This jacket was n't thick enough for the blustering winds. I finally reached a bus stop, going five blocks away from the book store and ran underneath the shelter that was home to a local homeless person. `` Have any change miss?'' he asked, huddled and shivering in his torn up sleeping bag. \n \n I shook my head. Damn jocks. `` Do you mind if I sit?'' \n \n `` No, go ahead,'' he motioned as he turned away from me and fell back asleep. I sat on the cold, icy bench, watching the snow fall softly from the sky. At least in here, I was sheltered from the wind, but like most bus stop shelters, it is n't warm. I looked at the homeless man, afraid to ask him what time it was. It was dark enough for the street lights to be turned on, but it should n't be so late that there was nobody driving around. I waited, hoping for a bus to show up. I watched cars slowly make their way down the road in the thickening snow. I could barely see people gripping the wheel with white knuckles as they carefully tried to get home. I knew that when I get home that I would get a beating or two just for not being home on time and for not answering my dad's phone calls on `` where the fuck are you?!'' \n \n Eventually, city side walk sweepers started to pass by and throw snow onto the back panel of the shelter. With the sweeper came out a coffee shop employee who decided to shovel at least some of the snow instead of shoveling the huge mound that would appear later. I decided to leave my spot, get into the cold winter air, and ask the person what time it was. `` It's 6:05,'' she said, looking down at her phone. \n \n `` Do you know when the next bus is coming?'' \n \n `` You did n't get the message?'' I shook my head as my stomach started to turn. `` The bus system is suspended until the snow lets up. There's already a huge crash in downtown because of the busses.'' Shit. I thanked the barista before making the treacherous walk all the way back home to face a deadbeat father. \n \n As I was walking in the thickening snow, I could n't believe how this day was going. I woke up late for school and ran into the jocks who were skipping classes to drink, *again*, who then pestered me to give them my money so that they could buy more alcohol, *again*. Then, my art teacher said that my art was `` pure shit that not even a homeless man would eat even if he was starving to death'', followed by my school counselor beating me down for having such high hopes but little ambition and basically calling me a `` failure''. Then I got kicked out of my only place of solace in this damn world, I had no way home besides on foot, it's snowing like a blizzard, my phone is dead, and my deadbeat father is going to deadbeat me into oblivion! Could this day get any fucking worse? \n \n It can. About half way home, I took a short cut into a shady part of the city. I knew that it would save me a couple of fingers and toes, but at what price? Being shanked? However, I was just dying to get somewhere warm and somewhere that was anywhere else but here. \n \n I remember faintly that someone bludgeoned me in the back of the head and took me away. I could faintly hear their voices: \n \n `` Yo man, why did you do that for?'' \n \n `` I do n't know. She looked like she had a lot on her.'' \n \n `` Well, let's see... Dude! She's a piece of shit! Just leave her outside!'' \n \n `` Why?! Do n't she have money?'' \n \n `` Nuh-uh! Just a shity phone.'' \n \n `` Well, that can get us fitty. Let's go.'' \n \n *I wish I could be anywhere but here. * I knew that when I was going to wake up -- if I was going to wake up -- I would be so dead. Not only was I robbed, but my dad and everyone else. I wish I could be anywhere but here. I wish I could be anywhere but here. \n \n Luckily, I woke up, but I was absolutely confused. I stood up and looked around. I was standing in an alleyway in a sunny beach town. I was sweating from my jacket -- granted, my jacket is n't that thick -- and took it off. I kept on walking out of the alley to assess where I was. Those thugs could n't have carted me all the way out here. Not in the snow. I could see the ocean for the first time ever. I had always been moving around with my dad, but it was always to cold places like where I live now. Everyone around me was wearing bikinis, board shorts and no shirts, or shorts and tank tops. There was music blaring, people playing beach volleyball, a barbeque going on, fun and laughter as the waves crashed into the shore. \n \n However, panic started to settle in. Okay, how the hell did I get here? I started to walk around and get a feel for this area. I wanted to ask questions, but I was too afraid to ask. I felt like nobody around me spoke English and people were looking at me with strange looks. Right, I do n't fit in again. I groaned, confused on how I got here and had no place to turn to. For once, I wanted to go home. I wanted to somewhat fit in or at least know where I was. \n \n I stopped at a visitor's center along the boardwalk. I saw the sign clearly: *'' Bienvenidos a Canc\u00fan'' *. Canc\u00fan? Mexico?! Clearly there was no way that those thugs had the time and money to get me from the dreary Midwest to Mexico. There's just no way! Great, now how am I supposed to get to the boarder without any identification on me?! Everything that I had was stolen except for the clothes on my back. I rolled my hands into fists, squinted my eyes and screamed, `` I just want to go fucking home!'' \n \n I opened my eyes, expecting to see a confused reaction on the people in the center, but instead I was transported to my hometown's city center. It was silent around the city. Snow was piled on everywhere. I could hear faint beeping coming from snow plows down the street. What just happened back there? Was that a dream? Or maybe those thugs injected me with some super power! No, no, this is n't *Heroes*, I thought to myself. \n \n But what if it is like that TV show. What if I could teleport anywhere? Does that mean I can also stop time? I laughed, `` Do n't be silly. There is no way that I could teleport myself into a bank vault --'' And it happened. It seemed that the power was out because the only camera in the room did n't have the glowing red light that indicated that it was recording. Wait. No ID, no money... I could start a new life. I could escape the stupid life that I lived and start a new. I had access to everything. I could get anything I wanted and nobody could catch me because they would n't be able to see me. \n \n I smiled as I grabbed a couple stacks of money, stuck it in my bookbag, and imagined a place a lot better than this hell hole that I've lived through. \n \n For once, there was no place that I would rather be in with a new identity. \n \n _____________________________________________________________ \n \n Holy shit!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] There is no prompt . Just write a story you 've always been thinking about or one you 've been thinking about sharing . Anything goes .\n","story":"I asked my friends for prompts when I was bored, my friend was being a smart ass and requested `` Write a story about a man who wakes up with no butthole. Make it a tense thriller.'' This was the result. \n \n **The Man With No Butthole** \n \n The first thing he noticed was the ache in his stomach. It was an unusual feeling, not the typical constipation he was used to, this felt deeper. He opened his eyes to the dark room around him, his bedroom, empty like always. His bachelor life was beginning to catch up to him and this ache in his intestines was another reminder. He was hungover, like most days of the week. \n \n He stood up and stretched which caused the ache to triple in intensity, this was new, he thought. Walking to the bathroom he caught a quick glimpse of himself in the mirror. His hair was a mess, he had n't shaved in months, and his eyes were bloodshot red. What the fuck happened last night? \n \n The toilet seat was cold as he lowered his already naked body on to it. Preparing himself for the first of what he expected to be a morning of hangover shits, he began the process... and immediately began screaming. \n \n The pain was incredible. The pressure on his abdomen pierced him like a thousand knives, but nothing came out. He had been constipated before, but this was different. He panicked, throwing himself off the toilet and onto the cold tile floor. It felt almost refreshing, but as his hands found their way to his butt cheeks, he discovered something he never could have predicted. His asshole was completely gone. \n \n His mind was racing, the panic setting in worse and worse as the pain became worse and worse. As he thought it had reached its peak, he heard the door bell ring. Struggling to get up, he threw on his discarded boxers and lurched to the door. As he opened it, his best friend Justin rushed through the door. \n \n `` Chris, are you alright bro? Do you remember what happened last night?'' Justin sounded frantic, like something horrible had happened. \n \n `` N... no. I do n't.'' The words forced themselves out through gritted teeth. Chris' stomach began to grumble, feeling as though his insides were rearranging themselves. \n \n `` You left with some girl, man, but I had a really bad feeling about her. Something was wrong with her, she barely spoke, and she just seemed... fucked up, I guess.'' Justin sat down on the foot of the bed and ran his hands through his hair. He seemed nervous, there was something he was n't telling Chris. \n \n `` Is she here?'' He asked Chris, suddenly sounding more nervous than panicked. \n \n `` No, it's just me.'' Chris laid down back on the bed, he felt as though his stomach would burst at any moment. \n \n `` Okay, good, because there's something I need to tell you. You've heard about those weird murders going around right? They say it's some weird ritualistic thing, their innards basically strewn across whatever room they were in. The thing is, someone claims to have seen the woman that did it. The girl you left with, bro, it was her I'm almost positive. I know it's strange, I mean the murders probably being exaggerated anyway.'' Justin laughed and smacked Chris on his bare stomach. \n \n `` They say all the victims had no butthole.'' As if right on cue, Chris screamed as his stomach tore open. Justin threw himself on the floor, his eyes shot wide in terror. There on the bed, some form of insect larva he'd never seen before were writhing through the intestines of his now dead best friend. \n \n Justin would later recount this story a hundred times, and each time he would say the same thing. \n \n They had her face.\n"}

Prompt me !\n","story":"*Before the post was first deleted, another redditor prompted me with ( along the lines of ) `` A habitual bridge burner is diagnosed with cancer and learns he has six months left to live''. So here is my reply to that. * \n \n Roderick stood in front of his phone. The little red message light blinked on and off. He pushed play. \n \n \u201c Dad, if you \u2019 re there, please pick up. We need to talk. Dad. I know you \u2019 re there. Pick up\u2026 Alright. I hate to do it this way. I \u2019 m cutting off service for the gas and electricity.

Maybe by doing this, maybe you \u2019 ll find a sense of reality and come back. We need you, dad, but you \u2019 re not giving us anything to work with. So, until then\u2026 Goodbye, dad. Find us when you \u2019 ve found yourself again. \u201d \n \n Roderick stood there. His heart had been torn out of his chest, twisted, trampled on, squeezed until all love drained from it, then thrust sideways back into his chest. His hand slipped from the countertop and hung at his side. He just stared at the wall unsure of what to do. \n \n The clock in the hallway chimed. Roderick was pulled back into his reality. He glanced down at his watch. Nine thirty one in the morning. He had been off work for just over a half hour. Roderick walked over to his refrigerator and with what strength he had left in him, opened the door. The cool air wafted over his arm and made its way towards his face, gently caressing it. Roderick pulled out a beer and shuffled over towards his well-worn reclining chair. He half sat, half collapsed into it \u2019 s embrace. He opened the cold beer and brought the can to his lips. The liquid bubbled on his tongue and left a lingering bitter taste after he swallowed. \n \n Roderick set his beer down and then reached up to his security guard badge, unpinning it from his shirt. He had been working as a night security guard for the past two and a half years. It was his ninth place of employment seemed to be the only job that he could hold on to. Working nights, Roderick was left alone to himself and rarely had to interact with anyone else throughout his shifts. He liked it that way, he had grown to hate the company of other people. But his hate for other was also the reason he couldn \u2019 t hold onto a steady job. Too many bridges had been burned. And now the bridge between him and his children had not only been burned, it had been torn down, demolished. Stone by stone, plank by plank, nail by nail until all that was now left was his calloused, bloodied hands. \n \n Roderick sat in silence as he sipped his beer. His thoughts ignited with hate for his kids but more so, hate for himself. Unconsciously he had started to crumple the can of beer in his hand. \n \n The mail flap on his front door squeaked open as the mail lady pushed a load of envelopes in though the slot and let them fall to a heap on the floor. Roderick struggled out of his chair and shuffled over to the mail that had sprawled out in front of the door. He bent over and gathered the mail into his hands. He flipped though what had been delivered to him as he walked into the kitchen. \n \n Bill. Bill. Coupons. Flyer. Court summons. Hospital notice. \n \n Roderick stopped short and held the last envelope in his hand. It terrified him. He dropped all the other envelopes as he turned over the one from the hospital. He hastily opened it and ripped the letter free from the envelope. He read each word intently. \n \n \u201c Dear Mr. Harris, \n \n We regret\u2026 \u201d \n \n Regret. Roderick had an involuntary body spasm as he read that word. \n \n \u201c \u2026We regret to inform you that your tests for lung cancer have returned back positive. We would like to make an appointment with you to discuss the severity of your condition and future treatment options. Please give us a call at\u2026 \u201d \n \n Roderick let the letter slip from his grasp. Cancer. He was scared. He didn \u2019 t have enough money to pay for treatment, and now, he had no one left to rely on. His body spasmed again, he could feel his heart sink. No, not sink. Stop. \n \n Roderick clutched his chest as he stumbled backwards and fell down. He may have had only six months left to live due to lung cancer, but cardiac arrest is what finally took the life of Roderick Harris. \n\n"}

As if she could read my mind, she quickly added, `` And you are *not* going to follow me.'' \n \n `` Is it because of the teenagers?'' I beckoned. `` Did they scare you?'' \n \n The handsome man- damnit! The beautiful woman turned back to face me. \n \n `` What teenagers?'' She demanded. `` There are no teenagers!

I ask. \n \n The sexually-appealing female human stormed off. Rats! I blew my chances! `` I guess it's time to go back home and hit the sack.'' \n \n `` Hit the sack?'' A man's voice came from behind me. `` Is that a euphemism?'' \n \n I turn around to a short, handsome man. `` He really was n't handsome, but I appear to have trouble with not speaking my thoughts aloud today. I do n't want to call him ugly in front of his face.'' \n \n `` Excuse me, sir?'' The man became sad. `` Words hurt, you know.'' \n \n `` I'm so sorry,'' I assure him. `` My mind is out-of-whack today. Let me make it up to you.'' \n \n The man nodded. `` Okay. What did you have in mind?'' \n \n I thought for a moment. Aha! \n \n `` Do you want to go beat some angry teenagers?

{"prompt":"[ OT ] Sunday Free Write : Leave A Story , Leave A Comment - Destination Narnia Edition !\n","story":"Microgravity. That was the worst part of combat alert for Nel. Silent running was always the start of it. With the exception of being reduced to slag by enemy fire, or cast out into the void in her survival suit, Nel could think of no worse way to spend her day. Everybody else disagreed, of course. \n \n Soren said it was the silence. Most of the ship \u2019 s power output shut down and the all-pervasive humming of a thousand different systems all but stopped. You just had to sit there and ignore the fact that most of that annoying humming was centred around keeping the crew alive. Soren always said it was like the \u201c calm before the storm \u201d. He \u2019 d even get that glassy eyed look like he was recalling the horror of battle. Not that he had ever been in an actual battle. But then neither had that cute pilot from the Attila, or that cute doctor from Sigma Orpheus, or any of the other auxiliary fleet ladies he told this to when they came in to port. \n \n Nel reckoned it was down to the fact that Soren was the coms officer. He didn \u2019 t like feeling useless, what with radio silence. And he particularly didn \u2019 t like having to shut up. In this way, Nel loved the silence. \n \n Kikoro said it was the waiting, just having to look at your instruments and stand by. Nel could understand that, but then she was nowhere near as twitchy as Kikoro. Gunnery officers were like that though. It was the downside of getting plugged into the targeting systems for half of your waking life. After a while they all went just a little nutty. It was a rare day that Kikoro wasn \u2019 t swearing to herself, or anyone else, for that matter. \n \n Whenever they asked Klaus he \u2019 d just mumble something about sensor ghosts or insufficient engine baffling. He was a nice guy, their Klaus, but he didn \u2019 t really get the point of talking. A bit too innocent for his own good. \n \n No, it was definitely the Microgravity. Nel \u2019 s life got measurably worse when the artificial gravity system got turned off. Her stomach would churn so much that now she usually came to the helm with some suppressants. And then there was the headaches and the vertigo, mostly from looking at a giant screen of inky blackness right in front of her. And call her old fashioned, but she really missed the luxury of being able to pee without a catheter. But what she hated most was when the captain spoke. \n \n \u201c Lieutenant Riggs, run a diagnostic on the emergency thrusters. \u201d \n \n She tensed. Here it came. The light spray of saliva impacting against the back of her neck. It happened every time the Captain spoke. The helm station being right in front of the captain \u2019 s chair made sense but that really wasn \u2019 t any consolation to Nel. \n \n \u201c Aye sir\u2026 Thrusters all report green status, test triggering detects a delay of 0.3 seconds to confirm. \u201d \n \n He thanked her and asked the other bridge crew to report on their sections. All the while spit particles hit her neck, her console and god-knows what else. \n \n What really annoyed Nel was that this never led to anything. They got combat alerts like this all the time, at least twice a week. And it always turned out to be an asteroid, or an old probe, or some damned anomaly for Klaus to swoon over. Never in her five years as the pilot for the I.S.F. Prodigal Son had she seen anything more frightening than an illegal scavenger ship. \n \n The radar display showed a dozen green blips in a rough cone formation, each displaying a name. The Prodigal Son flashed away on the display as the farthest left in the group, relative to the Conqueror, which sat proudly at the centre of the formation. Nel waited impatiently for a yellow blip to appear ahead of them so they could all get on with their lives. \n \n \n Five red Blips. That was odd, usually inert objects were yellow. And then it dawned on Nel. They were enemies, actual honest-to-god bad guys. Kikoro whooped and began figuring out targeting vectors. Nel just stared. \n \n \u201c Oh Fuck. \u201d \n \n The order came through from the admiral and Soren stammered out \n \n \u201c Guan Yu, Prodigal Son. Stay with our support ships and maintain silent running, Conqueror out. \u201d \n \n Eight of the twelve ships in their formation burst into activity. Engines flaring to intercept those five menacing red blips. Soren and Klaus relayed more information to the captain, suddenly both very interested in talking. Kikoro frothed at the mouth, emitting what sounded like a growl. Nel just sat there, watching as more blips appeared between the two fleets. They were firing, Nel was sitting on the edge of an actual battle and she had nothing to do. She was actually grateful when the captain spat out \n \n \u201c Riggs, begin charging the reactor, just up to 35 %. If this all goes to hell I want an escape vector plotted. Someone inform the other ships to do the same. Light signals only, let \u2019 s not attract too much interest. \u201d \n \n Nel and Soren answered in the affirmative and got to work. With work to do Nel could concentrate on something else. She plotted a vector away from the nearest station. Standard protocol was to avoid leading the enemy towards fleet assets. She was just finishing up when a flash lit up the bridge. Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked up. There was a slowly expanding white ball on the display where the Conqueror should have been. \n \n \u201c Oh Fuck. \u201d \n \n Within moments the support ships bolted, breaking silent running and moving at best possible speed towards the nearest station. The Guan Yu followed nearly immediately. There were more flashes and more green blips fell silent. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t touch that console, Riggs. We \u2019 re staying put. \u201d \n \n \u201c Aye sir. \u201d \n \n Nel was screaming inside her own head. Every instinct told her to run, follow the Guan Yu and call in the big guns. Instead they floated on as their support ships escaped. That is, until the support ships disappeared in their own glowing white spheres. And this time it wasn \u2019 t just Nel swearing. The red blips finished off the rest of the fleet and began spreading out. One turned lazily towards the Prodigal Son, seemingly curious rather than hostile. They were still well within weapons range. Running wasn \u2019 t an option and neither was fighting. \n \n \u201c Oh Fu... \u201d \n \n \u201c Stow it, Riggs. Evacuate aft section of the ship. I need a salvo directly aft on my mark. Prepare to jettison the primary reactor. \u201d \n \n Kikoro started laughing. They were all going to die and Kikoro was laughing. Nel had to hope that whatever was about to happen was marginally more pleasant than being turned into molten slag. \n \n \u201c Fire now! \u201d \n \n There was a thunderous sound and the ship lurched as its main guns fired. \n \n \u201c Riggs, emergency Reactor purge in 5\u2026 4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 mark! \u201d \n \n There was a horrible grating sound as the engine room was exposed to hard vaccum. The reactor trailed behind the ship, venting coolant and fissionable materials as it went. Every light and display on the bridge flickered and reset as the emergency reactor kicked in. Before their salvo had even reached the hostile a single phosphorescent bolt emitted from the red blip. It raced towards them. The crew watched in morbid silence. This was going to be it. \n \n And then the bolt hit the reactor and began expanding, enveloping it in an incandescent sphere of flame. \n \n \u201c Give me emergency thrust now! \u201d \n \n Nel obeyed and suddenly there was gravity again. She slammed back into her chair and nearly passed out. The display showed the Prodigal Son riding the edge of the expanding white sphere. She felt the ship roaring as its aft decks melted away. Suddenly she had an image of being incinerated, or being jettisoned into space. But eventually the roaring died down. \n \n \n The ship went silent for a long time, waiting and hoping. Until eventually the all clear signal was given. It was a mess, minimum power, massive damage. But they had lost the enemy, whoever they were. Nel guided the ship at a pathetically slow pace towards the nearest inhabited system. \n \n They would drift, for at least two weeks, in microgravity. \n \n \n\n"}

Well, I think it may be true. \n \n Let me start from the beginning. \n \n It looks like any other regular pen, really. I ordered offline from some weird website that advertised occult trinkets. The owner said it could answer any question correctly but came with a horrible curse. But me, being the sixteen-year-old slacker I was, bought it out of sheer boredom and procrastination. \n \n I got it on Thursday, the day before my major world history exam. I hadn \u2019 t paid attention the entire semester so I decided to use, just for shits and giggles. Maybe it would at least give me the false hope that I had a chance of passing. After all, I needed an A to avoid taking summer classes. \n \n Again... \n \n Well, when I sat down to take the test, I didn \u2019 t feel any smarter. And I know for sure that when Mrs. Green handed me my test, I was as lost as ever. But I did my best, filling out as many questions I could and even bullshitting the ones I had never heard before. I mean, who the fuck is Kublai Khan, anyway? \n \n That \u2019 s beside the point. I had no doubt I had flunked the test and dreaded going back to school that Monday, knowing I would have to deal with my parents. But when Mrs. Green called me up to her desk during class, much to my dismay, she showed me I had somehow aced the test \u2013 every single question right. \n \n Even stranger, everyone else had failed by a huge margin. Not a normal occurrence considering the valedictorian was in my class. I was always the one that people expected to fail. \n \n She doubted me as much as I did myself. But with no evidence of cheating, I got off jail free. I couldn \u2019 t complain. \n \n When I went back to my desk, I looked over my test. There was no way I could have done perfectly, not with how I felt while taking it. And as I looked over my answers, realization hit me. \n \n The answers were wrong. At least, I think they were. \n \n For example, I answered that the fall of Rome was due to an alien invasion. It didn \u2019 t take a genius to figure out I was wrong but for reason, my answer was right. Yet, when I went to the Wikipedia page for the Roman Empire, it said was brought to an abrupt stop by intergalactic forces. \n \n It meant only one thing. I wrote the first thing that came to mind. \n \n *2+2=5* \n \n I looked to my neighbor, Sarah, resident cheerlead captain and all-around bitch. She wasn \u2019 t the brightest of the class but could do simple math, nonetheless. \n \n \u201c Hey, Sarah. I have a question. \u201d \n \n \u201c What? \u201d she asked, give me a look like I reeked worse than a decaying pig in the sunshine. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s 2+2? \u201d \n \n \u201c I know you \u2019 re stupid but this is a new level. \u201d \n \n \u201c Just answer the question. \u201d \n \n \u201c Fine.

Do they live here in the ruins?'' \n \n `` No. Nobody lives in the ruins... well... that's not entirely true I guess. Some people do, but you do n't really want to run into *them. * In fact, I would n't really go as far as to call them *people, * either. But those guys in front look civilized, and they have light and electricity. They probably came from an Undergarden.'' \n \n `` An Undergarden? Is that what I think it is? That sounds cool!'' \n \n `` They are! Some of them are truly huge. Their main caverns go miles deep underground, and that's not even counting the tunnels where people actually live.

They built giant radiators to keep the caverns warm, but some of them do n't even need them. You see, some of them have natural lava lakes! Can you imagine that?'' \n \n `` Whoa! Do they get their energy from the Earth's core?'' \n \n `` No. Well, they do get some from geothermal stations. But mostly it's all nuclear powered.'' \n \n `` So they still know how to build those!'' \n \n `` Sure. These guys are n't idiots. The Sky Thieves took the sun away, not their brains! In fact, they even have Internet.'' \n \n `` So they can still talk to each other across the planet?'' \n \n `` Well... no. It's not worldwide anymore. The big cables froze and broke long time ago. They talked about repairing them, but it's hard to do those things out here. So it's more like a bunch of small regional networks now. Besides, it's not like trade is what it used to be anyways.'' \n \n `` What do you mean?'' \n \n `` Most Undergardens are self-sufficient. They must be, to survive. There are trade convoys from time to time, but you ca n't depend on them. Sometimes they get lost, or their vehicles break down and they freeze to death, or are attacked by... eh.... by *them. * So people have learnt to live on their own, and rely only on their closest ones.'' \n \n `` Like tribes?'' \n \n `` Exactly. Or like city-states. Sometimes three or four of them work together, in some kind of loose confederation, but most Undergardens are fiercely independent.'' \n \n `` Do they ever fight each other?'' \n \n `` Oh yes! They fight for resources, for access to the ruins, or just the usual political and religious bullshit. Some of those tribes are very weird, you see. Like the Sprova Undergarden, who thought if only they sacrificed enough children the sun would return. Eventually they managed to piss off their neighbors so much that three other cities joined together to attack them.'' \n \n `` And what happened?'' \n \n `` They invaded and fought in the caves, most of the time in complete darkness. The Sprovans had retreated into their tunnels, building traps and planting bombs. And when the invaders followed them, the tunnels collapsed on their heads, trapping them all. The battle lasted for months, and in the end the Sprova Undergarden was no more, though some say there are still people living in those closed off tunnels...'' \n \n `` Wow... that sounds awful. So people are still fighting each other... that's... not so different.'' \n \n `` I guess not. People are always people.'' \n \n `` So, about that internet you said they have... do they still have Reddit?''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Trees are actually carnivorous predators that remained dormant for the past Thousands centuries , today they wake up ...\n","story":"Two thousand centuries they'd lain dormant. \n \n Now, the trees were awake, and hungry. Very hungry. \n \n It took the humans a while to realize, but the vanishing deer quickly alerted the biologists, as their formerly problematic overpopulation had dropped considerably, and now even the hunters were having a hard time finding them, and hunting season had just opened. \n \n The deer were n't the only thing being hunted, and while it took a few days for the reality of the gory youtube uploads to set in, it became apparent that the trees were indeed alive and carnivorous. \n \n Unfortunately for the trees, they were still rooted firmly in the ground, and while their last 200,000 years had been quite restful, the strangely hairless apelike creatures that used to play in their branches and build basic hovels beneath them, had made some progress. \n \n Carnivorous and predatory as the non-dormant trees were, their urge to kill and destroy was n't nearly as developed as in these freakish apes. \n \n Their hunger was no match for the casual destruction of the lumber companies, for whom this was just another day at the office, only this time, the environmentalists were silent. The CEO of MegaLumber, Inc. had smiled `` Feel free to go hug a tree. Heck, hug all the trees you want. We promise not to harvest any tree you're alive and hugging.'' \n \n There had been a few masochists who took him up on the deal, but that problem was short-lived. Literally. \n \n Then it was just a matter of letting the [ tree harvesters go to work. ] ( https: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=Z8874Lrull0 ) \n \n It was a boom year for the hardwood products industry. \n \n The trees could scream, and did, but as it turned out, Jack Handy was right. \n \n `` f trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.'' \n \n Ultimately though, the noise pollution caused by thousands of square miles of screaming trees ( because even those that were n't being cut down were participating in the din ), combined by the realization that carnivorous as these trees were, they were still the main source of the planet's oxygen, required a more pragmatic solution. \n \n The forest lands were largely abandoned. The move to warmer climates continued. Desert, plains and beachfront real estate increased in value, and the forests retook the Northern cities. \n \n This resulted in a solar power boom, which, combined with the reduced need for heating oil and increased production of electric cars, gradually annihilated the petroleum industry, and with it, the warfare and extremism that it funded. \n \n A handful of old-timers missed skiing or hiking in the forests, but most everybody else enjoyed the warmer weather, and all in all, the Great Tree War was remembered with some bemusement a few decades later, much like [ Australia's Great Emu War of 1932 ] ( http: \/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Emu_War ).\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The Cold War went hot in 1983 . Today is September 9 , 2015 .\n","story":"*In 1983, most people assumed that a nuclear attack would inevitably result in the demise of humanity. The destruction of two helpless Japanese cities in 1945 by the most primitive form of atomic weaponry had created the idea that nuclear weapons were the be-all and end-all of war. That once deployed, warfare would cease to exist, because humanity would cease to exist. * \n \n *They were wrong. * \n \n *To be fair, the public was lead to believe that Mutually Assured Destruction was the only thing keeping their homes and families from being vaporized in nuclear hellfire. American President Ronald Reagan had started to trump up his Star Wars program shortly before the first missile was fired ( some have suggested that this was even the catalyst for the attack ), but the reality was that the super powers had already developed incredibly sophisticated interdiction systems. Of course, these were top secret, so nobody but the top brass new anything. Some of the military industrialists suspected that such systems existed, they built the components after all, but in the haze and espionage of the 1980s military-political environment nothing could be discerned for sure. In retrospect, it seems obvious that the governments would have been hiding such systems from the public. The popularity of MAD prevented war hawks from gaining any momentum, but in reality the leaders of the world were never so stupid as to leave their nation's safety in the hands of their enemy's capacity for empathy. * \n \n *Most people did not realize that for the thousands of nuclear IBMs that had been built, a thousand more ABMs were constructed. * \n \n *Of the thousands of warheads fired by both sides, fourteen hit their targets. The rest were simply blown apart in the air by the powerful networks of radar, satellites, and interceptor missiles. * \n \n *The long range bombers had similar success, managing to score a few successful hits. They did this by inundating the air with sheer numbers during the phase where the defense networks of each country were more concerned with stopping the missiles. By the time the Barrage had ended though, the majority of the world's long range bomber fleets had been decimated. A plane large enough to carry a sizable nuclear warhead is an easy target for intercepting fighters and AA fire. * \n \n *The nuclear weapons were not completely ineffective though. Moscow, St. Petersburg, Washington D.C., Chicago, London, Paris, Jerusalem, Havana, Beijing... and a few others, all melted into slag. Hundreds of millions of people perished. The destruction of countless atomic weapons in the atmosphere had altered the environment as well, initiating a period of global cooling. Of course, there were numerous side effects from the radiation, particularly in the third world where counter measures were not affordable. But as destructive as the Barrage was, it hardly took the fight out of anyone. * \n \n *For the third time that century, Europe became a massive battleground. Great armies of Soviet tanks swept into Western Germany, only to meet a ready and waiting force of NATO and French soldiers. Yugoslavia was not spared from Soviet invasion either, but unlike the West they could only sustain a fight for a few months before capitulating to their more powerful neighbor. It would be six years before they were liberated and the current Balkan Republic was founded. * \n \n *Manchuria became a battleground between the Peoples Liberation Army of China and the Red Army. The Chinese sustained millions of dead but managed to push into Siberia, adding half of the captured territory to their own in the 1990 Rio peace accords. * \n \n The professor stops his lecture and looks at his students. \n \n `` Here we can see how the textbook is a bit dated. Some of you might have noticed in your readings that the summary of WWIII does not mention the Chinese occupation of Vietnam. Unfortunately, the incident is only given a single paragraph in chapter six. Of course, those of you watching the news know that there is a violent insurgency going on there right now. The current conflict has its roots in this one, and is largely the result of Chinese agricultural policy in the post-Barrage world. But I digress, let's continue, shall we?'' \n \n *The Middle East erupted into violence as well. Israel had a much tougher time surviving when its Arab enemies were backed with Russian soldiers as well as weapons. Palestine is virtually uninhabitable now, nothing but unexploded ordinance, rubble, corpses and radioactive dirt. What was once the most coveted land on Earth is now utterly stateless, and can not be forced off onto any country, as no one wants to bear the cost of its rehabilitation. * \n \n Again Professor Whitmore stops. \n \n `` As some of you know, the Saudi Caliphate has recently been given a special `steward status' by the UN to speed up the process of reclaiming Palestine. Essentially, this means that they'll be placed in charge of reconstruction efforts involving several middle eastern countries without being legally responsible for conditions in Israel. Anyways,'' \n \n *The pro-Soviet regimes outside of Asia and Europe did not last long. The Russian military was simply not able to maintain any kind of power projection outside of places it could get to by walking. Half of the Soviet Navy is lying somewhere between Iceland and Greenland, and the remaining ships found their graves elsewhere. * \n \n *Despite the damage suffered in the Barrage, as well as a few minor Russian incursions in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington state, the United States largely recovered its power within the span of about two years. By 1987, the Soviets had been pushed out of Western Europe. By 1988, NATO forces ( France rejoined in 1984 ) were driving east through Poland. By 1989, the Soviets were penned into Northwestern Russia and capitulated a year later. * \n \n *The year 1990 saw the end of WWIII, and the end of the great and terrible Marxist experiment that was the United Soviets Socialist Republic. The war had a horrific cost: just over 1 billion dead in the span of seven years, 29 % of the Earth's surface rendered uninhabitable for decades to come, and immeasurable damage to the natural environment. In this textbook... * \n \n Professor Whitmore slammed the book shut dramatically. `` Blah blah blah, so on and so forth. Now, while that reading waned dramatic in some places, and of course is not up to date with more current events, generally speaking it's a fairly good account of the Third World War. We'll be continuing to use this book throughout the semester as our primary text, supplemented by other works...''\n"}

I quietly crushed the pills and mixed them into the red bull. I Filled my syringe with the concoction and injected it into the juice box. \n `` Jimmy, we're almost there. Drink this.'' My heart sank once again as this went against everything I had taught my sons. \n Jimmy drank the concoction without thought or hesitation. \n \n We finally arrived, at this point it was almost 4:00 just about time to play ball. We walked to uncle bob, who was neither my brother nor Jimmy's uncle but how else do you explain a bookie to your son. `` We all set bob?'' I asked. `` Well we're still not squared up from last week but how could i say no to letting the brother of homerun Howie play?'' `` I'll pay you back with my winnings today bob, we've been practicing all week.'' \n `` He can play for the Tigers, he will bat first.'' \n Batting was jimmys strong suit and I knew he would impress. The feild was dark with no one but the players and their dads standing around. The lights came on and the children placed in there spots. Jimmy took a step up towards the plate. He swang a the ball still on its post as hard as he could. He missed and collapsed. At first i thought he had just lot balance but after a second of not moving i remember his drink. I ran to him as fast as i could. `` Jimmy get up'' I screamed. `` Jimmy get up!'' He would n't respond and i began to shake him. `` Please jimmy just get up, please i did n't mean it boy.'' Tears rolled down his face. By they time the police showes up the ambulance had shown up. The two EMT's had pronounced jimmy dead. The cops had already spoken with several of the fathers most of whom had no traceable crime. Uncle bob was in cuffs l, for running the illegal gambling ring and I was taken next. I spent several years in prison for my crime, child endangerment they called it. My trial came and went swiftly as the evidence was all in the toxicology reports.I thought for years about what i had done, how i got there. I never forgave myself. I never will. The door slammed open in my cell for inmates to walk to breakfast. It was the 4th anniversary of jimmys death and i had stayed up all night. `` I'm coming jimmy'' I wispered as I ran as fast as i could towards the railing outside. I felt the railing hit my gut as i flipped over it. I looked down and saw the other inmates shuffling on the bottom floor before i closed my eyes and let gravity take my body head first down the four floor drop. It only took a second before the darkness set in. `` Papa'' I heard. \n `` Im coming Jimmy'' I spoke out to the darkness before everything I was, everything I am faded away. \n\n"}

Gavin stood up from his chair and looked out he window. \n \n `` I am going to head up to bed, I'll come over yours tomorrow if that's okay Ron?'' \n \n `` That is fine boy, but you need to know this, a lot of responsibility is going to fall on you now, a lot more than you have ever faced.

Are you still asleep? I brought you some food and resources to keep you going through the day, you need to eat'' \n \n `` LEAVE ME RON!'' came the muffled scream from within the house. \n \n Ron took a step back. \n \n `` It has begun! So early'' Ron said to himself. \n \n `` Let me in Gavin, I know what is happening to you!'' Ron replied, banging his walking stick on the door. \n \n Smashes could be heard from within, things being knocked over and fabrics being torn, like clothing. \n \n With an almighty swing, Ron smashes the lounge window, and clambers inside. He can hear a culmination of crying, screaming and torment. And he knew exactly what was going on. Ron turned the corner into the kitchen and in the corner, on the floor on his hands and knees is Gavin, retching and arching his back in pain. \n \n `` STAY AWAY FROM ME RON!'' Gavin cried out. \n \n `` Listen to me boy, you are developing... yourself. You need to let it happen!'' replied Ron, awkwardly. \n \n `` WHAT DO YOU MEAN LET IT HAP -- ARRHH!'' Gavin screamed out in pain as the sound of bones cracking in his back became audible. \n \n `` You are already 7 steps in, 2 more to go and it'll end I promise you, hold in there Gavin'' replied Ron, anxiously. \n \n Gavin screamed out in panic and pain as two more cracks began, he suddenly stops. \n \n `` I am bleeding, my back... it's ble-AHHHHHH!!!'' Gavin screams out for a final time as 2 beautiful white wings flourish from his shoulder blades and take up a large portion of the kitchen. \n \n `` You did it Gavin!'' Ron said happily. \n \n `` WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING TO ME, EXPLAIN RON NOW!'' exclaimed Gavin. \n \n `` Your mother was n't ordinary, she was an angel known as `` The Crebuli'', an ancient race of angel that protect the planets within our solar system, your mother protected Earth Gavin, she married your father, who is human and made you, a half-angel.'' \n \n `` THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE, YOU ARE HER FATHER!'' Gavin cried out, angrily. \n \n `` No Gavin, I am sorry, but that was a cover up for you and her husband. I am known as a decoy. I was sent alongside your mother to act as an alibi and to also make sure you had a successful passing, which you have done so yourself. You are a new protector of Earth.'' \n \n Gavins panting begins to slow, he is calming. \n \n `` A protector of Earth? I do n't know what I am doing and I am not strong enough to protect the earth.'' Gavin replies, yet again defeated. \n \n `` It'll all come in due time Gavin, you will gain strength rapidly over the next week, let your body heal and you will be ready for training. But first, learn to encase your wings so nobody sees them in public, otherwise the jig is up and the 10 o clock news is banging on your door.'' \n \n `` Right, how do I do that exactly?'' replied Gavin, quizzically. \n \n `` Easy, imagine them as another limb, you must learn to control them and harness them, you will do the same with your other powers too'' \n \n `` POWERS!'' Gavin exclaimed excitingly. \n \n `` ONLY to be used for good and when necessary Gavin...'' \n \n Gavin slowly arose to his feet, his wings spread out, knocking things off the counter. Gavin closed his eyes and breathed deeply and slowly. \n \n `` A new limb, I got this'' Gavin said to himself. \n \n Slowly the wings began to retract back into Gavin's spine. Gavin opened his eyes and smiled at Ron, who smiled back. \n \n `` You got i...'' Ron's face turned white and his expression became null, he dropped to the floor like a bag of bricks. Gavin ran to his side. \n \n `` Ron! Ron what is happening to you!'' \n \n `` Once a decoy's job is complete, we die. You must learn the rest for yourself now boy, I know you can do it'' Ron replied in a wheezy, faint voice. \n \n `` No you can not die, I need you now more than ever!'' Gavin replied tears beginning to well in his eyes. \n \n `` You will do fine my boy, just keep those wings out of trouble and the rest will come naturally, this is your calling boy, do not waste it'' \n \n `` How do I know where to begin?'' Replied Gavin, finally coming to terms with Ron's demise. \n \n `` All the secrets will unlock to you, Raziel. Now go, be amazing'' and with that, the twinkle in Ron's eye went out. \n \n Gavin slowly stood and walked calmly to the back door. \n \n `` Raziel? Is that my name?'' \n \n Gavin slowly opened the back door and walked to the center of his garden. He breathed a huge breath and sighed a huge sigh, before going into a crouching position, his wings un-folding and spreading. \n \n `` I'm going to be amazing for you Ron, and for you mum'' \n \n And with that, Gavin shot into the air at a blinding speed and took off into the sunset as Raziel, the archangel of secrets, and newest protector of Earth. \n \n The End. \n \n -- - \n \n Feedback would be HIGHLY appreciated: )\n"}

She felt like a hole was in her belly, swallowing her up, bit by bit, ever so slowly. She quickly realized what day it was, and set her mind straight. `` Happy Deathday to me,'' she muttered. \n \n She sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. She remembered to take deep breaths, and reminded herself of what the day had in store for her. Her friends and family would come over. They would remember all the good times they had that year, singing and dancing and laughing. The death symptoms would be soon forgotten in the bustle of the party. Her mother was going to make her favorite foods ( pineapple upside down cake and green bean casserole ), as well as her famous funeral potatoes ( obviously ). She would also be making strawberry shortcakes, her sister's favorite. \n \n Cynthia's little sister Katie had discovered her death day a few years ago. At first, mom figured she was moping around because Cynthia was, but they soon discovered that she really did have the symptoms: Cynthia and Katie shared a deathday! She at first did n't like sharing her deathday with her sister. It was supposed to be her special day. Her day to hear everyone's kind words and small parting presents for the afterlife. Her time to make peace with those she's fought with and forgive those who have wronged her. Everyone would do what she wanted, because it may be her last day on earth. But since they shared a deathday, it was always a joint party. Double the people, half of whom were little kids running underfoot she did n't know - Katie's friends. \n \n Still, it was nice to have a partner on her deathday. She often imagined Death would come for them in the same year, going out with a bang together. Cynthia had never actually seen Death, although many deathday party attendees would claim that they did. Most often they said that he was a man, neither tall nor short, dressed in black and did n't make a fuss. He just shows up, and escorts the Dying out of the party. Once it's realized that they're gone, a final toast goes up, the Death being complete. \n \n Cynthia waddled slowly from her bedroom to her sister's. She could n't stay jealous of her sister sharing the attention. Not on their Deathday. The last few years the first one to get up on Deathday would go to the other's room, and they'd spend the first few hours of the mo [ u ] rning together, getting psyched for the party later and getting through the pit in their guts together. The pit of dispair was always the worst, but there was also the listlessness, and the feeling that your body is being pulled away and you're not sure whose or what limbs you're moving. It goes away by the end of the day. If you're still here, that is. \n \n She got to her sister's door and did n't bother to knock. But when she opened the door, her sister was not there. Instead, there was a man. He stood there, dressed nicely but not overly so, and in his hand he was holding... nothing. It was an empty space, but his hand was held slightly away from his body, grasping something invisible. Cynthia looked at the bed. The covers were rumpled, and Katie's nightgown was also crumpled over the pillow. \n \n Cynthia smiled as she realized what the man was holding. He had come early. She waved to the empty space as the man led it towards the door. \n \n Happy Death, Katie.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A group of Secret Service storm into your house , the President huddled in the middle . The lead serviceman looks at you and says , `` They 're coming ! ''\n","story":"It was around noon when I got the call. It was from Mason, the lead serviceman who once serve alongside me when I was \n on the team. That was until I retired of course.the word he said shortly after were the ones I hoped to never hear which were `` Operation Eagle's Nest is at go ``. Before I retired, the Pentagon assign me as one of the five `` nest'' for the Eagle ( president ) to take refuge in when shit goes down at the White House. \n \n `` We're 10 minutes from your location, it's bad, really bad. We need all the firepower you have.'' Mason's voice was filled with fear which is n't really like him. We're talking about a guy who I once saw shoot 3 terrorist with a Kalashnikov that he disarmed from another terrorist. With that I decided to bring out the Green Box. The Green Box was a box where I put all the heavy firepower and ammos but only to use them when the situation forces me to. The box has all the thing that gives your typical trigger happy maniac an orgasm. Ranged from Desert Eagles, AA-12s, MP5s and all the ammo that'll last for a week. After taking out the green box I quickly head to my study to activate the surveillance cameras which covers every single inch of the house. My phone rang which usually indicates that Mason's team and the president has arrived. \n \n I walked out of my study to open the door only to be suprised when Mason let himself in followed by the president and 4 others agents. I quickly locked the door and activated the titanium lock I had install after a previous operation nearly went bad due to a door thats easily breached. The president was then lead into my basemennt which I had rebuild as a panic room almost similar to the one under the White House with monitor showing the surveillance cameras around the house and food supplies that could last days if anything were to go wrong. \n \n The president was accompanied by 2 other agents which left me, Mason and 2 other agent who are probably new due to the fact that I do n't recognized anyone of them from my old days in the team. We all armed up with weapons from the Green Box. Mason looked at me with fear in his eyes and an AA-12 in arm followed by the word that send shivers in my spine `` They're coming!'' `` Who's coming?'' I asked. `` You're not going to believe me when I say that time travelling mechanoids from the future are coming to kidnap the president of our time to extract information'' Mason explained to me all the details I need to know about these mechanoids like how the Russians actually build them for war against the Pro-Ukraine Army after the assassination of Vladimir Putin III and how they soon became smart enough to operate on their own and this led to the fall of Russia and countries around it. \n \n With the technology that was seized from the conquered countries, they finally had enough to build a working time machine. I could n't believe what I'm hearing. Its like a plot of a Terminator movie and is way to far fetched for a sane man like me to believe. But the president is currently in my basement\/panic room so I guess the matter is really what's been stated. All I did was go to my study to check on the monitors only to find out that camera 5 which was directed to the left side of the house was offline. Suddenly followed by camera 2 and 3. `` The shows about to start! `` I screamed to warn the 3 agents currently in my living room and quickly took out the MP5 and Desert Eagle from The Green Box. \n \n 10 minutes pass by and we'd set ourself for a gunfight with furnitures set as barricades surrounding us and The Green Box by our side making sure to bring hell upon whoever or whatever that goes through the doors. `` If only the public knew about this.It would be the beginning of World War III `` Mason exclaimed. `` If what you say is true my friend, then we got ourselves a fight for the future of mankind then. Mason and the other 2 agents let out a brief laugh only to be interrupted by the sound of a vehicle that grew louder by the second. `` Brace yourselves!'' Mason screamed before the door was rammed through by what it seems to be a Range Rover. Luckily the force was n't enough to ram the whole vehicle into our direction but just enough to seperate the titanium lock on the front door and enough to fit half the Range Rover in the house. I rose up only to nearly get shot by gunshots coming directly from the front windshield. The sound of it was like it was coming from an assault rifle. Probably an standard M4A1 or a G5 assault rifle \n \n I ducked down and returned fire without even looking where I was actually shooting. Mason shot around 6 rounds before reloading. There was silent which made us think that we've won. One of the 2 new agents rose up to check our surrounding. Out of nowhere a gunshot was heard and the agent fell flat to the ground dead. `` Fuck!'' I screamed while emptying out the remaining rounds left before changing to a fresh mag. \n \n From a hole I discovered in the barricade, I saw them. There were 3 of them. All of whom bodies were filled with gunshots wounds but none of them seems to be showing sign of pain at all. Their faces static and their expression shows no sign of humanity. They looked like human maybe to adapt to the surrounding of my time without drawing attention to themselves. The gunshot wounds expose their cybernetic counterpart like how Arnold Schwarzenegger looked in the Terminator. It seems the MP5 was n't doing much good so I switch to the AA-12 and fully reloaded it. `` I'll take the one on the right while Mason takes the one in the middle, you ( the other agent ) finish the guy on the left. With the signal from Mason and comfirmation from the other agent that we decided to end it once and for all. `` Shoot to kill'' I whispered and on the count of 3.....2.....1. \n \n All hell broke loose as me, Mason and the other agent rose up shooting our targetted threats. I ca n't remember looking at my target but I did comfirm that I finish the wjole mag only on my designated target while the other 2 did the same with theirs. *Click* indicating I was out of ammo. So was Mason and the other agent. We saw the `` corpses'' of the mechanoids spreaded across the living room and Mason took out the Desert Eagles to make sure it's really over. Mason then proceed to shoot all 3 mechanoids at the back of their heads until he was out. He shot each of them at point blank comfirming the kill or deactivation of these sons of mechanical bitches. He then look at me saying `` They'll be back. I'm sure of it.'' I replied to him with a smile on my face `` We'll be ready when that happens. \n \n Thats all I got and I hope everyone enjoyed reading it as I enjoyed writing it ( I also apologized if the length was too much or the use of words was n't up to par ) english is my second language\n"}

It was a common sight to him, looking at it through her viewport every morning as he prepared himself for the day. Nuclear engineering was monotonous, but good paying, and he never needed to worry for his safety thanks to gene-mods. The worst that happened was the one time he started to secrete a thick fluid from his skin pours that reduced the radiation infection in his blood. He did n't know how sweating gross liquids out of himself helped with radiation sickness, but he also was n't a biologis. He just knew it worked. \n After fitting his suit on, he grabbed his super tool. It was an older model, relying on nanomachinery rather than the dark light current like the newer ones. One of these days, he thought, I'll get a new one. It was a small, disc shaped object set in a glove on his right hand. \n He grabbed a apple from his counter top and took a bite. Sweet apple, he mused, Great. Like I do n't have enough sugar in my diet. Since the full acceptance of Modded foods becoming the mainstream food source, nutritional values and availability sky-rocketed. He lived his entire life having never seen a single piece of food go rotten, nor has he ever had food poisoning. With every fruit and vegetable tailored to dietary needs, many people can still eat what ever they want with out the risk of allergies. \n Although few existed nowadays, thanks to eugenics, he was still allergic to soy. He always thought it funny that the Terran Population Quality Insurance Program managed to make him, like the rest of the human race, have an IQ of 200 and be purged of almost every known hereditary disease, along with developing a body immune to nearly every mundane illness known and they still could n't figure out how to make someone able to eat from a smorgasbord with out choking on their own tongue. \n He was a man of the future, an IQ of 200 and the body of what many not more than a century ago would assume to be that of an Olympian. \n In fact, when he thought about it, the fears of these miraculous technology his ancestors had seemed so ludicrous to him. Not a single ethnicity was wiped out by eugenics, not one super plague was spread by GMOs, not even a single mad AI had ever come to light. He was so confused at what the hubbub was about back then, but he could understand it. They had good counter arguments, saying eugenics could be used to further a racial agenda. Luckily, the only person scummy enough for that was executed last May. Some even were dead set against GMOs, fearful of the chems polluting there body. Sure, the first two waves of modded foods were disheartening, but the men and women in the labs only took that as a sign they needed to work harder for their fellow man. \n Overall, these fears where swept aside. Eugenics helped eliminate the genes responsible for retardation and a slew of hereditary diseases, and the food that fueled their bodies were the ultimate nutrition to what could be called super humans. \n He looked out of the window one more time, and wondered. \n \n What if it did n't happen? \n \n He shuddered at the thought, took another bite of his apple, and went to work. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n To me, the scariest consequence is not trying it.

{"prompt":"( WP ) in a world where emotions are considered drugs , your family has sat you down to talk about your addiction to joy .\n","story":"My family had said what they wanted to say yet I could make no connection with them. All I can think is,'Why?' Why is this considered a problem? At what point did I become the bad guy? At what point was I suddenly doing something *wrong*? I'm not hurting anybody. It felt amazing and more importantly it felt right. Questions and accusations are being thrown at me whilst the only thing I can focus on is myself. \n \n My first time was thanks to a friend who let me try some of his Joy that he'd bought online. It was a white powder with a slightly damp feeling, it stuck to everything, the scales, your fingers and even the inside of the baggy it arrived in. We were free for the evening with no plans for the morning and had agreed the feeling was right to try it. With the lights up high and our favourite music on, we both did a line together. \n \n The onset was slow and uncomfortable, it felt like an internal battle between the void of normality and this new sensation that wanted to take over. I struggled. Gripping my stomach I decided to lie down and rest, somewhat forgetting what I'd done or what was about to happen. When I next opened my eyes, things were very different. The world was now full of colour and life. I was blown away by the simplest things. My friend was rocking on the edge of his seat, biting his lower lip to suppress his laughter. Any attempts at communication between us ending in self-perpetuating laughter fits that reduced us to tears. All my worries were gone. All that I could possibly ever want was right in front of me. Hours upon hours of pure childlike wonder and bliss. \n \n We agreed to meet up in a few weeks and do it again. A similar experience just made us want to do it again. We started meeting up every other week, then every week. Each time, the same smile would creep across my face as the emotion embraces me with a whispered, `` Welcome back.'' At this point he'd got me connected with his source and I was able to start ordering my own. I did n't believe it could be so simple... I'd lied about my name, I'd signed a document with a fake signature and was greenlit to start purchasing. It was exactly like any other online retailer. Browse Products. 200mg Joy. Add to Basket. Proceed to Checkout. Done. \n \n I'd started to invite people over and introduce them to it, always with similar results. The rush of showing someone new how great everything can be was unbeatable. To watch their eyes wide with excitement, to watch them stumble and overcome everything exactly the same way you did. You got to be their guide, their parent. It became such a sought after feeling that I'd started to do it multiple times a week, mostly by myself to learn more about this exciting place. At some point the line between reality and this world were blurred, I'd started to hate the feeling of sobriety but how could you not?! I refuse to believe anyone who says otherwise. I was still working, I was still paying my way, I was causing no harm. I'd run out of people to introduce it too and all the others were n't responding to my attempts of communication. Had I come on too strongly? Did they not enjoy it as much as I? Surely they must, what's not to love. Pangs of other emotions are starting to leak in, my thoughts cloudy, what is this feeling, guilt? Remorse? Fear? The word `` obsessed'' sounds loudly in my ear as I jolt upright. \n \n I take in for the first time my true surroundings. There's no one here, the entire thing a fear induced trip inside my own mind. I have n't even lived with my family for years... If they could see me now they'd be devastated. My clothes unwashed, my appearance dirty and unkempt. I look in the mirror and I do n't recognise myself. My eyes are wide and wild, there's something else in them peering back.

You can feel like a million dollars, and yet the universe tosses garbage at you. Or you can be moping about gloomily, and every crack has a rainbow in it. For me, it was one of the latter days. I was sulking as I washed the dishes, sulking because Pat had told a real knee-slapper, and it had made me crack a smile, right when I was projecting this image of dignity and gravity. Bloody Pat, always makin' a guy laugh. \n \n I rinsed a wineglass and set it down to dry. Sometimes your cup runneth over, and sometimes your cup runneth over when you're the designated driver. Like today, that girl Kelly I've been talking to. I was late for a meeting with the boss, and of course she chooses right that moment to poke her head out of her office and say hello. \n \n `` There he is!'' they'd all said, the second I showed my face in the meeting room. And then, a standing ovation. `` Baloney, old boy,'' my boss's boss thrust a cigar at me, `` that client you talked to is going all in. The company's saved!'' Well, all hail the American hero, right? They demanded a speech, I'm usually great at those, but Pat was sitting right there, every time I looked at him I started cracking up, he'd been whipping out all these jokes at the bar last night. It was awful, very uncomfortable, there I am trying to improvise all these praises about Amalgamated Aluminum and everyone's glancing nervously at each other like, why does he keep cracking up? \n \n Scrubbing the silver now. Some folks are born with a silver spoon, you know, and for them, all that stuff comes natural. I'm the opposite, mama brought me up in a union house. So when the CEO is clapping me on the back and making all these jokes about all the money the company's making and how much better we are than all the little folk, god, it makes my blood boil. And there's Pat, doing his'little people' impressions. `` We are the ninety-nine pershent,'' he says with that mocking lisp, and the worst part of all is I ca n't stop myself giggling at the way he says it. \n \n Here we go, my authentic Japanese carving knife. Got ta be careful with this one, you could cut your fingers washing it. I turn it around idly, dark thoughts racing through my head. Just then, there's a knock at the door. `` Hey Baloney, got room for a sixpack??'' Oh lord, it's him! Why did I have to pick the same apartment building as Pat, I'll never forgive myself for that one. \n \n I storm to the door, I'll show him sixpack. Still got the knife in my hands, absent-minded. But when I fling the door open, look what I see. He's... crying? Before I know what's happening, he's got me in this bear hug, sobbing and sobbing. `` Oh Baloney,'' he says. `` I'm so jealous of you, man. I wanted that contract so badly. I wanted them to cheer me like that for so long. That's why I'm always joking and horsing around,'' he sniffs, `` it's the only way I can hide how inadequate I feel working with you.'' \n \n Well, there he goes again, bloody Pat. There I am, ready to chew him out, ready to yell at him. And would n't you know it, he chooses right that moment to pull out his bro-in-need-of-comfort card.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a police officer who has just pulled over a truck for speeding . The window rolls down and you find out the truck is completely automated . How does this encounter go ?\n","story":"`` Do You have any idea why I pulled -- WHAT THE FUCK?!?!'' \n \n The white ford i had pulled over was... Completly empty. Call me crazy if you. Hell, I'm not even sure I'm not. But I will never forget what I saw that day. The cab was empty, the backseat was empty, the bed was empty. I even checked under the seats and under the truck itself. I even went as far as to go bat to my cruiser and check the dash cam footage. Nothing. \n \n I exited my cruiser wondering what the hell was going on. As I approached the truck once more, I noticed a glow coming from the cab. A light blue orb of light I could n't quite see the source of shone through the back window. \n \n Looking through the open drivers side door, I saw the source. A laptop lay open in the passengers seat. Wires running into the floorboard and up under the dash board. On the screen was a single sentence in blue letters. \n \n `` NO, WHY DID YOU PULL ME OVER?'' \n \n It took me a few seconds to realize the question was meant for me. Slowly I said, `` Well, you were speeding back there.... about 35 M.P.H. over the limit.... What's going on here?'' \n \n The computer did nothing. Not a damn thing. I sat there stupidly, much longer than I should have. I called for a traffic unit on my radio while I walked around the truck, trying to make sense of all this. A voice came back over the radio. \n `` Car 216 headed your way. Be there in 10.'' \n \n I made my way back to the cab and reached to open the door, then froze... had i closed the door? I did n't remember closing it but surely I did. I shook it off. It had been a long day. And this was n't helping. I opened the door and looked at the computer again. \n \n `` WAS I REALLY? I DO N'T REMEMBER SPEEDING. MY BAD. \n \n This was n't funny anymore. I stared at the screen. I wondered how this contraption worked. I worried for a moment it was A.I. gone rogue. \n \n `` Well, this is a pretty baren area. So... slow down for future reference okay? You mind if I look at your drivers license?'' \n \n Again.. nothing. A distant roll of Thunder caught me off guard. It was n't even cloudy... how was there thunder. I searched the sky and found nothing. When i looked back at the screen the words were different. \n \n `` It's under the hood.'' \n \n My skin started to crawl. Somthing was wrong. I reached for the handle to pop the hood and the latch sprung forward stinging my hand \n I recoiled, glancing at the screen on my way up. \n \n `` Let get that for you, Mike'' \n \n I forgot about the stinging in my hand. How did it know my name? Sure, it was on my badge but... I saw no camera... anywhere. \n \n `` Thanks...'' I said as I made my way to the front of the truck. I placed both hands on the underside of the hood and looked through the front window the screen was now rotated to point out the front. Towards me. On the screen in big red letters, that looked like they were scrawled In blood, we're two words. `` MY PLEASURE! \n \n Somthing touched both of hands at the same time. Somthig... hard, \n And scaley. I yelped and fell backwards. I could see under the truck. But God I wish I could n't. A large lizard was weaving it's way between the pipes and machine parts onto the ground below. Looking straight at me. It looked... hungry. \n \n I drew my pistol and fired all 9 rounds into the lizard beast. It curled up a few feet away from me. Bleeding. No, wait, that's not blood... its....it's oil.. it smelled like... like a a well oiled rifle. I got to my feet. Hearing a small voice off to my right was slightly jarring. It said \n \n `` NO! GODDAMN IT BENJAMIN I TOLD YOU HE WOULD SHOOT IT! YOU FUCKING MORON, THIS TOOK US MONTHS! NOW WE HAVE TO START OVER!'' \n \n `` what the hell is going on here?'' I asked with as much authority as I could muster \n \n \n `` Do n't worry about it officer. Just back away, things are about to get very hot.'' \n \n A second later a gout of flame shot through the cab, and engulfed the dead mecha-lizard. All of the doors and windows flew open.. \n And the engine turned over. \n \n The inferno truck took off down the street quicker than I could realize what was going on. I ran back to my cruiser and tried to tell dispatch what was going on. The same voice as earlier said... `` oh and we blocked your comms. Go ahead back to town, we are done here.'' \n \n \n \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ EU ] Write an alternate epilogue to the Harry Potter series .\n","story":"The three of them rode in silence, Father staring out the window with a distant glaze over his eyes. Stress from work had consumed him over the past few weeks, even Scorpius could see. `` I want you to take advantage of your time at school, Scorpius dear. Make friends, participate in events, and try your hardest. These are the *most* important years of your life. At least they were for me,'' Astoria, his mother said with a smile, straightening the green tie around her son's neck. `` And for your father.'' \n \n `` Do you think I will be placed in Slytherin?'' Scorpius asked. He did n't look his parent's in the eyes as he spoke, he only kept his head down and his eyes glued to the air conditioner. It blew the cool air on his face, which he was thankful for. The anxiety was burning away at him like someone had pressed a lump of coal against his very soul. \n \n `` My family has been in Slytherin for seven generations, your father's family for much longer. The Sorting Hat will take one look at you and he'll know that it's the right fit for you dear. Now remember, do n't mess around in your Potions class. Your aunt Daphne turned her nose into a pig snout for nearly a month when she was in her first year. Always read the labels,'' Astoria chided before Draco cut in, colder than ice. \n \n `` Do not give the boy false hope. Slytherin is for a certain breed of wizard and perhaps he does not have what it takes,'' Draco pressed a knuckle against his lip and chewed, still staring out the window. He thought for a moment and the silence that filled the car was so thick, even the most powerful spell could n't shatter it. He sighed and faced his son, leaning in ever so closely. `` Slytherin is a house of snakes, Scorpius. Though I named you for it, a snake is a fearsome creature that coils around its prey and chokes the life out of them. The venom in its fangs can bring down the greatest of men, wizards or muggle. You are not the sort to strangle your prey, or poison them. And do n't think that it's a bad thing,'' Draco softened for a moment and glanced at his wife. `` The Slytherin of your Mother and I's time were different. We were foolish and shameful, but we were Slytherins and we are proud. Whatever house you are placed into, we will be proud. Do you understand that, Scorpius?'' \n \n Scorpius nodded. His father returned to his window and his mother cooed about her years in Slytherin, and every so often Draco would turn and acknowledge her with a curt smile. The cart stopped at Kings Cross station and the three filed out and soon Scorpius found himself standing before the great Hogwarts express, his mother hugging him and his father at his side. Children were all around him, wizards like him. \n \n `` Do n't let a single Potter or a Weasely get ahead of you. You are Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, *my* son,'' he knelled before his son and hugged the boy. `` Have a good year, Scorpius.'' \n \n Scorpius boarded the train and found an empty cart. He set his bag over head and bid his parent's a farewell. The curtain pulled away and a pale face appeared, thin with a wisp of dark hair on his head. `` May I join you?'' the boy said, in a quiet voice. Scorpius nodded and the pale boy settled in, `` So what house do you think you'll get into? My mother was a Slytherin, so I hope I'll be put in their too. Family stuff and all that, y'know?'' \n \n Scorpius nodded. `` I have big plans for Hogwarts and getting into Slytherin is the first step,'' he said as the train pulled away. `` If you manage to get in, I could use your assistance. Your *allegiance* I'd go as far to say.'' \n \n The boy stood up straight, smiling. His eyes were like slits of dirty ice and his smile could kill with his big, square teeth. `` I like your style... what was your name? They call me George Macnair.'' \n \n `` Malfoy. Scorpius Malfoy.'' The two boys shook hands and Scorpius eased back, confident that he would take his mother's advice. His years at Hogwarts would certainly be the best in his life. They'd be the start of his greatness. \n \n As the train rode towards Hogwarts, Scorpius flicked through a little black journal and doodled with a pencil as dark as ash. It left a hot outline on the page that burned the tips of fingers - a design of great evil. In the past, it had heralded great evil. A coming darkness. It was a sign of death itself and the people who brought it upon the world. In his journal, Scorpius Malfoy etched the Dark Mark and smiled with satisfaction at its completion.\n"}

Another thing I will never understand about them, but the mission calls for secrecy, so secret I must be. \n \n I've been embedded in this hell hole for almost three days. It feels like two eternities. Luckily I was able to make a local contact with just the right mix of connected and stupid to allow me to befriend him without him raising any suspicions. We've proven that the vast majority of these people are far below normal level of intelligence, Control had thought that this would be an advantage to our mission. However, they did not factor in one critical consequence of this: a stupid person with powerful weapons is a very dangerous thing indeed. So many weapons, all shapes and sizes, and I could n't even wear any protective gear; I was stuck with this flimsy, flapping, fabric like material covering me. The mission called for adapting, so adapt I must. \n \n My meeting with the contact was scheduled for 1900 hours local time, the venue one of their local social gatherings. This would be a perfect opportunity to set up proper groundwork for the mission. I would get the first glimpse of how these primitives functioned from up close. We already had the greater plan, all that was needed was some specifics to fill in some gaps. We had to have contingencies for even the smallest variables that could stop us from reaching success. The mission called for accuracy, so accurate I must be. \n \n Balancing on the high wooden chairs was proving to be a challenge, I had to use my arms to steady myself on the table in-front of me. Where was this blubbering fool? My eyes scanned he room and saw his blurry frame entering through the doorway. I could tell it was him by the pungent smell that always hung around him, cutting through any other odors no matter what they were. It smelt like combusted carbon among a host of other things, after I was done with him I would have to conduct a full analysis as to what caused it. He perched himself next to me, slapping my shoulder as some sort of greeting. `` What are you drinking?'' he asked. I pointed to my water, or rather their pathetic excuse for water. This did not seem to go well with him, he flung a hand in the air, accompanied by a slew of lewd exclamations, he ordered the server to bring a tumbler with something `` more appropriate.'' I had not ingested anything else since i had arrived at this desolate place. I did not know if my body would be able to handle their unconventional ways of getting nutrition. But the mission's goal was discovery, so discover I must. \n \n \n As the server placed the container on the table some of the brown liquid spilled out and onto its shiny surface. A single drop found its way onto my lap. The alarm bell embedded in my earpiece let out a loud wail in my head that only I could hear, `` Warning! Warning! Imminent danger! Harmful substance alert!'' My body instinctively recoiled and I stood up. `` Whats wrong man? Stop being so jitterish, take a gulp and relax'' my contact snorted, taking his drink in his hand and in one swift motion emptying it into his mouth. I stared at him in shock. `` Does he not know?'' I asked myself. `` I think that is poison!'' I exclaimed. His reply was to mockingly laugh at me and gesture for another. `` You got that right, best moonshine this side of the west,'' he said gesturing for another. `` Try it and get your mind blown.'' My eyes fell on the glass, the warning alarm was still ringing in my ear. If I refused, would it be considered a sign of weakness? Would this idiotic maniac find it offensive? Was this a test? What sort of sadistic ritual was I being taken through? They must have found out somehow, my cover was blown and I was going to die at the hands of this inferior being, in the most vile of places. \n But the mission called for sacrifice, so sacrifice I must.\n"}

Give this story a modern twist .\n","story":"In the kingdom of Worcester, tales aspread of a beautiful princess locked in a tower located in Mount Odom -- the highest peak known throughout the seven sovereign -- and was said to be guarded by a viscious dragon. With the rumors abound, assumptions were added to the gossip. It was, common knowledge among hunters, thugs and bandits, soldiers and noblemen, that dragons horde seas of glittering gold, of stunning gems, of rubies and diamonds; and so it must, if their speculations were to be believed, that upon success will their reward be, a beautiful maiden and with her, riches beyond their ken. So the men dared, and laughed and said, that theirs will be the treasure and the fair lady, and set about to seek the truth of the tale, but none that went and gone, returned the day next or the next or the next. Talk about the treasure and the dragon and the princess died down, became but whisphers in the dark, and shouts of anger and grief. Now, years had passed, and almost the tale was forgotten, until... \n \n `` Iff'ee woz n't such a bloody fool'' Jory began, an empty mug in hand ``'ee wud still be breathin', an-and sharing a laugh wif gud o'jim he'e'' with a wobbly hand he gestured at the bar keep, then sniffled `` and me'' \n \n Matthias leaned over his chair towards good old Jim, and whispered `` Who's he talkin''bout?'' \n \n The grey-haired giant hunched down `` His brother'' \n \n `` Zas' royt! Myy eedio' brotha''' Jory shouted over his empty drink. He inclined on his spineless chair, and tried to focus on Matthias and Jim `` Oi! Bof'a you, stop movin''' then he fell from his seat, and never came up. Matthias jerked and went as if to help the unconscious Jory up, but Jim put a hand to his shoulder, stopping him. \n \n `` Best give'im rest, lad'' the bar keep shook his head `` Le''im feel the consequences on the morrow'' \n \n Matthias settled back on his stool, and tried to get as comfortable as he could manage with the silly seat `` Wo's that all'bout?'' \n \n Jim nodded towards the sleeping Jory ``'is brother's name was Dave'' he took the empty mug lying atop the recently vacated counter `` Years before, there'd been hearsay'bout a princess, a dragon and a treasure'orde as far as t'eye could see. Back then, t'woz all that's got everybody's tongues a waggin''' after he cleaned the mug, it was sat in a wooden tray, along with the other mugs `` Eyes of avarice and lust filled my tavern, and many o' the men'ere talked big'bout them bee'n the ones slayin' the dragon and takin' the wench and the gold fo' themselves'' Jim shook his head, thick brows furrowed middle his forehead `` One o' those men was Jory's brother'' he let out a loud sigh, as though pushing off a great weight `` After making the lot o' us bleed through our ears with their boastin', none o' the men returned to tell the tale'' \n \n Matthias spared a look over his shoulder, on Jory who started snoring on the floor `` Poor bastard'' \n \n Jim walked towards Jory, stopped at the drunk's side and kicked the unconscious man lightly with his leathers `` Oi! You sad slop! Wake up! You're disturbin' the other patrons'' \n \n Matthias cleared his throat, which garnered Jim's attention `` So... where would this dragon be... exactly?'' \n \n The barkeep raised one of his thick brows at the question `` You lookin' to fight the scaly beast yourself, lad?'' \n \n Matthias caught in his game, had'yes' written all over his face `` No. But nothin' wrong in askin', is there'' \n \n `` There is, if ee' could cost you your life'' Jim left Jory, and went to stand in front of Matthias, the length of the counter keeping them separated `` Lis'en.

When you walk out o''ere, and'stumble' unto tha' information, o'which I know you will cause you're the kind o' guy who gets it one way o' the other. Go back, lad. Ne'er think o' ee' again'' \n \n At that, Matthias spent the night in Jim's tavern. Though, most of the hour, he wasted waking up the drunk Jory. Come morning, he left the tavern with Jim still kicking the unconscious man's ass, trying to get him to stop snoring. \n \n Once outside, the sea breeze greeted him, the fresh air calming his nerves. He decided to go home, though his mind still lingered on the location of the mysterious tower. On his way, he walked as straight as a sober man can walk, and whistled horribly along quiet alleys. Until from out of nowhere, a voice rang out calling his attention. \n \n `` I hear you seek the dragon's lair'' a cloaked figure emerged from a distance `` I know where you can find it'' \n \n Matthias hid his surprise, if the stranger saw through his facade he could n't see `` Why are you telling me this? Wots ini' fo' you?'' \n \n `` A cut of the profit'' \n \n Matthias arched a brow `` Wot?'' \n \n `` I'll be coming with you, of course'' the cloaked figure stripped away the cloth that concealed its identity, then let it drop to the ground `` When we kill the dragon. I get half of the treasure you're getting'' \n \n It was a scrawny youth. A boy, with a wild mop of wheat colored curls and big set of blue eyes. \n \n `` Hold it. I seem to be at a disadvantage'ere. You get to come, AND,'alf the treasure I ge'?''

Her tag read \u201c Trina. \u201d I happened to know that wasn \u2019 t her real name. \n \n Having worn out the entertainment potential of staring at the orange patterned carpet squares, which in some miracle of engineering were both greatly fuzzy and only slightly more yielding than concrete, I tuned in to the Mr. Norton channel. \n \n The usual middle American concerns peppered with indistinct images from popular daytime reality shows and softcore pornography: What was that noise the minivan was making? Got to remember to buy fish food. Does Sizzler serve wine? God does Ruth have any idea how wide her ass has gotten? Billy, I will take this fist upside your head so hard if you touch your sister one more time no, no, I \u2019 m not like grandpa, I love my kids. I could never hurt my children. Yes I could. No I won \u2019 t. Don \u2019 t forget the fish food, there \u2019 s a WalMart on the way home. Could this desk bitch take any longer? That \u2019 s unkind. Fuck unkind, I \u2019 m so tired and I don \u2019 t know where my life drained away into this beige frantic listlessness. I bet it *was* Billy who did that to the cat. I just bet it was. Because I need that. Ruth must have the credit card. I can pick up another pack of Hanes at the WalMart, kill two birds with one stone! \n \n \u201c Yeah, thanks, we had a great stay! \u201d \n \n My sainted mother \u2019 s precious behind, great stay. This place was one of the great desert mysteries. How could a place be so gently repellent to every human sensibility without having been designed that way? The Answers in Genesis squibs were barking up the wrong tree with their arguments about the impossibility of eyes evolving. They should be basing their intelligent design rhetoric entirely on the existence of this particular Quality Inn. That and Barstow in general. \n \n The Nortons trundled out the squealing sliding doors, all khaki capri pants and banality. Mr. Norton wasn \u2019 t worth more than a distraction. The mid morning heat was bleaching me like driftwood, and plucking his wires would take more energy than I cared to expend. His sins were as soft and resigned as his paunch. \n \n Now Billy, he I jotted down in my leatherette portfolio. The higher-ups love a touch of proactiveness, and I had a junior that could be dispatched to see if this cat business was a little prank or if our cherub was working toward a vivisection merit badge. Maybe this trip would have at least one tiny shred of justification for the business-class flight. \n \n You always smelled Frank before you saw him. His scent was a pheromone darkness, a sliding greasy pool at the edge of perception. He also bathed in enough Drakkar Noir to singe a retirement home \u2019 s worth of nose hair. \n \n \u201c Heya Bev! How was your flight? I flew all the way from Akron and boy are my wings tired! Har! \u201d \n \n Frank laughed like a dictionary. Once, a very long time ago, I had a dog that would say \u201c bark, \u201d just like Frank laughs \u201c har har. \u201d \u201c Bark, arf, \u201d it would say with that doggy cocked head. Those memories swam away like nervous fingerlings if I tried to look at them directly. \n \n The low nubby chair beside me creaked under Frank \u2019 s bulk. Upwards of his collar he had perpetual grey stubble, oily baldness, oily pitted jowls, and oily little grey eyes. Downward his ill-tailored suit mostly disguised trunkish limbs that didn \u2019 t bend where typically expected. His blue tinged feet bulged over sprung loafers. I tugged my sensible-length skirt down a little further, sent out a hopeless prayer that Frank would at some point come to grips with the concept of socks, and began a countdown to him trying to flirt with the piscine Trina. I hoped she would eat him this year. \n \n \u201c Yeah, I didn \u2019 t get stuck in Denver overnight this time. Do you have the outline for Carol to review? She should be here any time, she \u2019 s driving in from Riverside. \u201d \n \n \u201c Ugh, that slint. You \u2019 ll give the presentation? I don \u2019 t want to listen to her flap her meat. \u201d \n \n Spittle foamed in the corners of his mouth and on his bulging lower lip. I looked out at the empty sky hanging over the tan expanse of parking lot and switching yard the hotel backed into. Just at the corner of my mind another sky appeared. Jewel blue over soft green grass, rustling leaves, cut by crystal sprinkler rain. I tried to grab the memory without looking at it, like you creep up on a fly, but it skittered away. \n \n \u201c Uh huh. That \u2019 s fine. We \u2019 re up this morning even. He \u2019 s got two in his basement right now, and I just got a text from monitoring that he \u2019 s been pricing out video cameras. Looks like he \u2019 s considering doing some sharing. \u201d \n \n \u201c Great! Har! You think we could squeeze a recruitment drive out of that phlegm he talks to on his little forum? \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s a possibility. Mark is making sure there \u2019 s enough obfuscation allocated to us to mitigate the police factor. There \u2019 s Carol. \u201d \n \n A pinched woman with a spindly flat chest, kyphotic hump, and jarringly voluptuous hips was extracting herself from a creaking Volvo. I took a preparatory breath and straightened a little. Carol was likely to flash her palps at you if she felt you were threatening her seniority, and I had been handed primary oversight despite being the youngest of the team. \n \n Inside, a scent of the neighbor \u2019 s roses. A dog barked happily. The soft grass. A sun warm blanket. Looking up into eyes that smiled, arms that reached down. Buzz of bees and gnats in beams of light. Lemonade sweet sticky. I tried to drag it forth, to see what was in this little glowing place in my mind. For a moment I felt that if I could pull it forward into the awake part of me I could hide there, coat myself in it like a thick salve, and this would all slide away. \n \n Memory crumbled into dust. I tasted copper, heard plaintive shrill whining, final gurgling. The glow fell into the thick sea of more pertinent recollections and sank below. \n \n I pulled out my notes and tapped them straight on my knee. Carol stomped through the foyer, leaving high heel divots in the cheap linoleum entry. She glared at Frank and I, folding down her mouth in what she probably thought was a smile, then turned her seething bale toward checking in. I sighed. The room smelt of artificial musk, dessicated carpet fibers and ancient burnt coffee. \n \n \u201c Frank? \u201d \n \n \u201c What honey? \u201d \n \n \u201c Do you think Sizzler serves wine? \u201d \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A superhero finally kills his super villain for something unforgivable .\n","story":"`` You have 2 minutes.'' \n \n The raspy voice said before the line went dead. Blue Blur raced back to his home several states away after getting a phone call from his nemesis Arcane. His foe threatened the life of his wife and newborn while Blue was away fighting more crime with the Alliance of Justice. Blue's life had been a roller coaster of a story, after discovering he had the ability to control his mind and body at super speeds like many of the other `` Enchanted Ones'' as they were called. As one who once used his powers for evil by robbing people, stores and banks blind before they could literally blink, Blue met Allele. \n \n Allele was the only one who made Blue stop and enjoy time rather than rushing from one thing to next while he had been actually trying to rob her. It was Allele who pleaded for Blue to change his ways after she realized he would still come see her from time to time after taking her belongings. After gathering up the strength to talk to Allele, Blue and her formed a friendship where she eventually convinced him to stop taking what he did not own. \n \n However, his childhood friend Arcane was never fond of his friend, who was like a brother to him, changing his ways. Arcane and Blue Blur became close after being taunted by other children growing up. Arcane learned to hide and duck off into shadows while Blue would always run away. After Blue ran into an area where Arcane already was hiding, the two sought revenge on their bullies and began to steal and beat them up. Lusting after the feeling it gave them, they continued their acts of violence after their teenage years to others forgetting they were once victims. \n \n Allele reminded Blue of how being a victim felt and persuaded him to stop his evil ways. Blue did stop and eventually switched sides joining the Alliance of Justice to stop other Enchanted Ones from causing chaos with his speed. The closer Blue became to Allele, the more distant he became from Arcane. There had always been a mutual understanding if Arcane would continue his destruction and Blue caught him, he would let him go because of their friendship. But Arcane was tired of Blue stopping him. Blue changed and was no longer the brother he once had and Arcane wanted to change that. Breaking into Blue's apartment, Arcane knew Allele would be home alone with their son while Blue was with the Alliance several states away. \n \n Summoning Blue over the phone while holding Allele and her son hostage, Arcane demanded the former friend to arrive shortly and become a partner in crime again. Blue arrived shortly after to his home with his son screaming in living room, Arcane standing stiff and Allele no where to be found. \n \n `` Where's Allele Arc'' Blue demanded rather than ask \n `` She's gone Blue. She told me you would never go back.'' Arc started as the tears in Blue's eyes began to form. His face grew hot with anger. `` She told me you moved on and I'm not shit to you. Now you'll know what it's like to lose so-'' Arcane's words were cut short as a sharp hook from Blue landed on his jaw. The two fell to the ground as Blue rapidly punch Arcane multiple times before lifting him up in the air. `` Blue...'' Arcane manage to stutter out coughing blood onto Blue's face. \n \n No more could be taken as Blue wrapped his hands firmly around Arcane's neck and squeezed. Blue stared into Arcane's unforgiving swollen eyes until the light faded from them and his body went limp. Blue dropped the lifeless body as his son's crying finally came back into his hearing. \n \n `` Blue?'' A familiar voice called out. There Allele stood in the doorway with a dislocated shoulder, bloodied and bruised. Blue's mouth open as he glanced at the lifeless body of his former friend \n \n [ Sorry so long ]\n"}

The more I stayed out of his way, the more smokes I got. Avoiding him was my addiction. And that was well and fine for me. My old man was an ass. Well, that's putting it lightly. \n \n He met my mom two months before I was conceived, married her a month before I was born and cheated on her less than a week after I popped into the world. I ca n't even remember my dad's explanation for showing his true self to my sweet mother. Some young filly he met in a bar. Fuck him. His wife had just given birth to his first child, but the only thing he could think about was fucking. Fuck. Him. \n \n Well, my mom's family was n't the kind to take that lightly. My uncles beat the shit out of my dad when he came back to his apartment. They said if he did n't make right by my mom, *he'd* never walk right again. So he did. For a time. Then my mom's older brother got into a car crash. Wrapped himself around a telephone pole, doing 75 in the suburbs. My dad was real quiet at the funeral. Fuck him. \n \n Then my mom's younger brother went a few years after that. Smack overdose. No goddamn surprise there. By now I was old enough to remember what my dad did when we got home. He went down into the basement for a looooong time. When he came back out his eyes were red and he reeked of some kind of acrid smell. My mom sent me to my room and started yelling up a storm at him. Bless her heart, that's when my dad hit her for the first time in years. I sat curled up in a ball in my room. Fuck him. \n \n Well, I'm not some junkie kid anymore. Those fucking death sticks my dad gave me to keep my mouth shut when he'd smack my mom around only reminded me how much I hate him. That's why I still carry one around. If he ever comes back to this house I told him I'd skin him alive. I kicked him out when I was fourteen. It was n't hard. I was big for my age ( got that from my mom's family ). He was a shriveled little shit from all the gunk in his body. I broke his right arm in two places and gave him a scar to match the one he gave me when he came home drunk on my tenth birthday. Nice and jagged, right across his left hand. Fuck him. \n \n `` And who the fuck is this?'' I shouted across the lawn. My lawn. `` I thought I told you to fucking get and stay gone.'' I leveled the gun at him. \n \n `` Yuh are n't going to shoot me, son. Yah got too much of your mum in yah t' try it.'' \n \n `` What the fuck do you *want*? Mom's been dead for years now.

Do n't you owe a dying man that?'' His voice was trembling now and his eyes were becoming watery. I dropped him out of the sights on the gun and took a look at him. His skin was pale. His hair had gone white. he was blind in one eye and was leaning on a cane. He was a sick man. \n \n `` You have one chance to explain your miserable goddamn existence and why something like you can outlive mom.'' \n \n `` I suppose't's all I deserve. I've tried my whole life tah protect yah from your mum's family. You know what they are? Monsters. And not a monster like me. They're worse. When a man gazes too long intah an abyss, thah abyss gazes into him, boy. And your dear old mum's family was the Mariana's Trench of abysmal families. Your uncles were pimps. That girl they caught me `` fuckin' `` after you were born? That was my sister. She was caught up in some bad debts and I was helpin' her tah escape. You'd do the same for Alli, would n't yah?'' He went on for what felt like hours. He broke down the crime pyramid that was my mom's family. I listened in abject horror. \n \n Finally, as dusk was settling around us he finished with a huff. `` Now do yah see why I did all I did? I couldn; t have yah falling in with your mum's family. Maybe I was n't the best father, but I was better than them monsters.'' \n \n `` Too little, too late.'' I pulled the gun up into his abdomen and squeezed the trigger twice. The sound bounced around the neighborhood and off in the copper dusk a dog began barking. `` Grandpa showed up a few days after mom passed. Romeo and Juliet, huh? How fucking romantic. You and her, never meant to be. Well Mr. Montague, you wo n't keep mom waiting for long. I hope this is as painful to you as it was for mom's family to watch her dedicate her life to such a miserable wretch.'' \n \n I held his mouth shut and after a few minutes he stopped breathing. I dialed grandpa's number and sat on my porch with dad propped up in a chair next to me. My hand eventually found its way into my pocket and pulled out the cigarette. I pulled out my lighter and began to suck down the semi-sweet smoke for the first time in a decade. Tastes like shit. \n \n Everything grandpa said about mom and dad came back to me. The star-crossed sixteen year olds, my dad trying to run when mom got pregnant, grandpa trying to get him into the family business, his refusal, everything my dad said about grandpa was true.

By his side always was there the graceful and cunning Conswervo. They themselves spawned from the very universe, bounded across the starry night plains, today only visible in patches throughout our dusty skies. One day, as they were frolicking with whimsy, they encountered the crotchety god Frickyshun. Being young and full of hubris, Enegy had not seen where he was going, and collided with Frickyshun at a great speed, knocking him over. \n \n Picking himself up with indignation and a want for retribution, Frickyshun had demanded some form of compensation from the young Enegy. Enegy did not have wealth to speak of, and worriedly pondered for a few moments, when Conswervo gave his wisdom. `` This man will surely not be satisfied with the pocket lints and shiny stones we could offer him.'' spoke Conswervo; `` We must regrettably give him our speed, which allows us to travel across the plains so haughtily.'' And in this way, Enegy and Conswervo had to give up their fast pace. \n \n Being slow for the first time, the pair had now felt the warmth of the sun catching up to them. After a while, they were unbearably hot, and once again Conswervo had a cunning solution. `` My friend, if we are to stay like this much longer, we will surely boil away into nothingness. We must find shelter from this great red ball!'' After searching and searching, they came across our land, which had only just been birthed from the rocks and stones and waters floating around the cosmos. There, they had found the leafy green pastures of our forefathers. Coming across a great oaken tree, Conswervo spoke thus: `` O great wooden one, we are but two travelers who are unbearably hot, and we wish to take shelter in your broad leaves. May we stay for a while, to cool ourselves off?'' The tree, gazing down upon the two with its branches, was sympathetic. `` Weary travelers. You may rest for a while in my shade, for it is cold on this Earth, and you two, still yellow from the heat of the sun, give my oaken limbs warmth.'' \n \n And thus, the two heroes took rest, soon dozing into a mighty slumber, lasting until this very day.\n"}

Brown, old, metal clasps locked shut, about the size of a shoebox and a few scratches here and there. Looked like something his grandfather would have owned. Truthfully, it wasn \u2019 t the box that disturbed him, it was the note sitting on top that really worried him. \n \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t open the box \u201d the note said, in his own handwriting. That was the first bit of writing. Below it was scratched a really hasty message that read \u201c No, really, d\u2026 \u201d The second note wasn \u2019 t finished, but Alan was pretty sure it would have finished by saying \u201c don \u2019 t open it \u201d. \n \n \n Alan snatched the paper off the box and flipped it over. It was torn from a book. Not just any book, the one he \u2019 d been reading last night. He grabbed the book off his nightstand and flipped open the cover. The jagged tear along the paper fit perfectly into the torn page in his book. Alan started to close the book back on the page, but thought better and put it back next to the box. Somehow, that \u2019 s where it belonged. \n \n \n \u201c This is stupid, \u201d Alan announced aloud to the apartment as he strode around anxiously. \u201c It can \u2019 t do anything to me. I \u2019 m going to open it. \u201d His hands raced through the air, flowed along the bed covers, and came to a rest on the box lid, but they resisted his will and refused to open the box. \n \n \n \u201c Come on, \u201d he whispered to himself, \u201c Just open the damn thing. \u201d \n \n \n \n \u201c Where... did... this... come... from\u2026 \u201d the box said. No, not exactly. A voice from *inside* the box said that. It was Alan \u2019 s voice coming from inside the box. He had said exactly that when he walked into his room and found the box ten minutes ago. The sound was repeating from inside the box, only it was slower and drawn out, like listening to a tape recorder slowly dying. \n \n \n \n Alan pressed his ear close to the box and waited. Slowly, the expected words floated up through the box walls \u201c This... is... stupid\u2026 \u201d \n \n \n Shocked propelled him from the box; it was repeating what he said, just slower, and later. \n \n \n Anger replaced shock as Alan decided he was being tricked by a stupid tape recorder. The righteousness of his anger drove him forward past any trepidation. In a single motion he scooped up the box, unlocked the clasp, flipped open the lid and looked in. There was no tape recorder inside. Instead, there was a tiny universe inside. Alan could see a smaller version of himself inside the box, holding a tiny box, looking at a tinier self holding a tinier box, on down and repeated forever. He slammed the lid shut. \n \n \n \n A slight afternoon breeze pushed its way in through the open bedroom window and the world remained still. A soft slow thump of the box being slammed shut in the past echoed up from inside of the box. Alan wondered if what he saw was real, or an illusion. For a second time, Alan undid the clasps on the box. \n \n \n As he opened the box, he realized why the box had been locked in the first place. Once again he saw an infinite fractal of Alan \u2019 s holding a box. Softly he muttered, \u201c Oh, shit \u201d. \n \n \n \n From the infinite well in his hands, the Oh Shit came rumbling back up, first quiet and slow, then mounting, reverberating and building to an incredible cacophony of Oh Shits. The sound become so powerful that it became a blowing gale wind of Oh Shits coming out the box so powerful he couldn \u2019 t push the lid back closed against it. A tornado of Oh Shits spun the room out of control, blowing and spinning. \n \n \n Everything slowed to a sudden stop like a swing reaching its apex, then went back the other direction. A swirling vortex of Shit Ohs started pulling on Alan with force beyond his muscles. He dropped the box onto his bed and tried to run, but it was too late. He was sucked feet first into the box. Once up to his waist, he struggled to keep from going into the box. \n \n \n Alan spotted the paper, still on his bed. He had one chance. His left arm gripped the age of the box, while his right arm reached for a pen from his nightstand and his legs went numb being torn deeper into the box. He managed to uncap the pen, and add \u201c on \u2019 t open this box \u201d to complete the halfway finished note, before his strength abandoned him, his arm failed, and he was sucked into the box. \n \n \n The lid snapped shut, the room went quiet. \n \n \n \u201c Where did this come from? \u201d Alan said as he walked into his bedroom and spied the box sitting on his bed.

At first it was hard for him to do so at first but it had been months, giving him plenty of time to get used to the skirt. \n \n `` Black eyed peas?'' The east ringleader rose a brow, but her thin fingers grasped two large bags of maxi pads. \n \n `` Also, the south wants shampoo, but make sure they fulfil their end of the deal!'' \n \n `` Yes mam!'' \n \n *** \n \n *BEEP BEEP BEEP! * The alarms blared and the big door to Vault 69 opened. \n \n `` Finally! Finally see the men of Vault 70!'' A rowdy woman slapped his thigh, unaware that he was one. \n \n `` Betcha she do n't need one, because she's all up banging Jesus, am I right!?'' \n \n `` Yes, I suppose...'' he gave a holy gesture, incase the lord was watching. \n \n Yet what entered the vault was not men, it was women, who also wanted men. \n \n Only then did they understood what had happened: The men were redirected from both shelters, leaving them going back and forth until they were caught in the nuclear blast. \n \n `` No men!?

I had no idea what happened. I ran. \n \n A war broke out. I was sent to fight in the trenches. What good I could do I did not know, a bony, malnourished impoverished man like I. A flea on the back of greater men. I despised my life. I was determined to get out of this hell hole. I was determined to get back to her, so that I could feel the warm of her radiance. So that I, the very same mere shadow, the very same meager person, could breathe the same air as someone so, so, so above me! \n I steeled myself. Slapped my face to wake up to reality, and got ready for the whistle that would sound soon after. I could hear the whistle only for a moment in time, before I heard the yelp of a man behind me \u201c WAI-! \u201d the voice said, as if it didn \u2019 t want me to jump the trench. I turned and saw half of the face of the man, from that day, the day that perfection manifested love and desire in my heart. He was an officer. The charge was called off abruptly, almost immediately; about 50 of our boys had already jumped up, to be met by the cold, hard embrace of lead, others got the warm, fuzzy sensation of a mortar blowing half their body to bits. It reminded me a little bit of a crazy man in the next town over; his idea of art was taking shapes, squares, triangles, and splashing them together, not unlike my current scenes. Triangles of hips and legs, crumpled chests, people sprawled at ungodly angles not normally possible. Dashed with a red overlay to the khaki and brown; an autumn leaves painting, made entirely out of men. This shook my mind like no other event ever could. I will never forget the sight of red upon red. \n \n 10 long years later, the outcome of the war unclear, I was finally able to go home - discharged. I needed a walking stick at that time, and I couldn \u2019 t feel my left hand too well. Thankfully, I still had whatever wits I had with me then, and now a veteran \u2019 s pension. As I stood at the gates to the town upon my return I took in what was home so long ago, and home once again, I heard a commotion down the street. My life drastically empty following the war, my curiosity got the better of me, I slowly made my way down the main cobblestone street, and through the gap of the throng I saw her. She had aged but was unmistakable to me. \u201c She slipped off the cliff! \u201d I heard a young woman moan, choking with tears. \n \n \u201c The Mistress was spreading his ashes \u201d another said, stifling tears. The whole town felt this, lost to my own thoughts, I wondered aimlessly. By the time I gathered myself, I realized I was standing outside my old art shop that I had before the war, the wood partly rotten, a haggard building much like myself, hidden even in a small town near the outskirts. I peered inside; ravaged by the street urchins no down. I pushed at the door, which gave way as if pushing air itself. Some of my brushes still there; laying where I left them the day I went to war; some of my paints untouched \u2013 not worth much to a street urchin. I got to the center of my workshop, crouching down, my knees popped, not what I used to be, I heaved on the bronze latch on the wooden boards below my feet; thankfully far too heavy for even a group of street urchins to try to pry, I reminded myself that I \u2019 m thankful this town is small, and more honorable than the larger cities or I \u2019 d have stark nothing left, I pulled out the only thing remaining in my storage vault; My last canvas. \n \n Without thinking, I worked, morning, night, morning, night. Non-stop, I continued, guided by my memories, my emotions, guided by what could only be the spirit of her residing within me. Red across white, across black I slashed at the canvas, I was not the real maestro here. On the fourth day, I stumbled back, famished, and parched. I collapsed in a heap of exhaustion. \n \n Awaking at night, I stumbled in the dark until I could find a candle to light my way. I turned, and noticed the beauty of the Mistress that I had put on the canvas, illuminated by the flickering light of my candle; not as I saw her being carried by her people, but as I saw her 10 years ago, in that garden. The same wide, long red dress. The same thoughtful pout, her longing green eyes. I hadn \u2019 t painted **her** necessarily; I had painted my memory of love. \n Slowly, without thinking and starting from the top, I caressed my painting, tears welled in my eyes, blotching the fresh paint as they hit the bottom of the canvas, and then I noticed the painting started to peel, squirm, and move beneath my hand. I pull away sharply and the painting continued to twist and turn, deforming my love, my art, my Mistress. It pulled away, leaping off the canvas before enlarging in the stale air of the workshop. As suddenly as the painting had started moving, it came to life before my eyes. There was no flash, no bang, this was what people would call magical \u2013 but magic does not exist, does it? \n \n She opened her mouth, expecting my mistresses \u2019 soothing voice, the song of an angel, I leaned in. \n \u201c Thank you for this vessel, tool \u201d a harsh voice screeched at me, as if someone unaccustomed to speaking, had finally decided to no longer be mute. It happened faster than a flash, I fell, and as I fell, I saw her move over me; her long legs strode around and out of sight, fleeing into the darkness. I tried to move, I could not. I was plastered, as the tingling feeling of hot-cold fell over me; I was cold, getting colder, it was winter after all. But a hot sensation was surrounding me, spreading around me. I felt for what was pinning me, the blur in my eyes leaving momentarily as I recovered from when my head hit the ground, I then put chin to chest to gaze over myself. A shaft of wood, not 40cm long protruded from me. On the end of it were some feathers, a note tied to the shaft of wood dangled against it, moving too and fro with my labored breathing; I reached up to grab the note, the writing was floral, flowing, of an expert calligrapher \u201c Here you are Pictomancer, your lover \u2019 s heart with your message \u201d The note almost sounded as if someone was spitting the words at me. *A Pictomancer? By all the angels what \u2019 s that? * I thought to myself slowly, everything become heavier, slower, harder. I noticed I was spreading red around and glanced at my hand. Covered in red; my shirt, my workbench, the ground that I could see, my hand, the shaft of wood, everything was covered in red. \n \n I had seen this before; First was my love for the Red Lady, second was the war, shaken by the sight of the Red Battlefield, and as it dawned on me, that a color, so perfect on a lady, who herself carried in her the radiance of angels, could be so devastating on a battlefield, I realized what I saw, and what I didn \u2019 t, are both two sides of the same image. Alas I had created a perfect monster. \n I reached up slowly, as my hand rose her face entered the corner of my vision, her image changed, her thoughtful pout and distant eyes changed. Large eyed with a smile far too wide, I couldn \u2019 t help but panic, and as I did so my body ached and I groaned. Her teeth changed appearance before me from smooth and ordered into jagged beast \u2019 s teeth. I saw a fair maiden with a psychotic face, and then that was all I ever saw. \n \n They say all is fair in love and war, but red is not the fairest color, for now here I sit, in a room clad in white. \n \n -- -- - \n \n I dont know if this is in the spirit of this WP - but I wanted to do something different. This is only my second attempt at all of this, and whilst I feel like OP was hinting at something magical - All i could think of was something psychopathic, a broken mind, so that's what i tried to go for in the end. \n Please let me know how i went: )\n"}

Studying, for once. Lingering by the door, Simmons watched his son rub his temple slightly, probably cycling through the day's lessons - his scleras, usually black, now flashed with the remnants of color from the stimvids. \n \n `` Zack'', Seth called. `` You coming for lunch?'' \n \n The teen barely acknowledged his parent's presence - a lazy hand waved dismissively in his direction, and Seth smiled, dangling a small plastic bag before him. \n \n `` Got some fresh-caught locci, if you're not coming, they're all mine''. \n \n Not like the words even registered. Above them, the roof rustled heavily, as the thermoplates regulated to the noon's scorching heatwave. \n \n *** \n `` So, how's school?'' \n \n `` I do n't get it, Dad'', Zack mumbled through a mouthful. `` We're now stuck in the dumb 2050's, llama-lame. It's a bore''. \n \n `` Ah,'' Seth smiled knowingly. `` The height of the hysteria. You grandma was a girl then, believe it or not. Ran around her college campus naked, protesting `` the man'', as the ecoterrorists called it back then''. \n \n The boy grimaced, the idea of his sweet granny stark naked and rioting clearly a distasteful one. He really did n't want to tell dad, but the oldies were *gross*. Extinct-level gross. Whenever he visited his grandparents in Astana, he got the same prickly shivers he got when watching some animal documentary vid. Like, no-one enjoyed looking at a gamadril's shiny red arse, did they? And so, how were the oldies different? Sniffing with a rather loud snap of his nostril flaps, Zack glanced at his father covertly - well, at least the genwunners were okay-ish. Still a work-in-progress, lacking the sleek polish he, Zack, possessed, but not a total yrod. \n \n `` The man?'' He mirrored to hold the convo up. \n \n `` Corporations, government. *'' Go green or we stab you in the spleen'' *. They thought the warming was our fault. Fuel fossil cars, greenhouse gas, mass production, so forth'', Seth rolled around a piece of locci with his chopsticks. `` Like that could be the reason for the polar caps melting! Culminating, fanatic crazies even murdered a USF president, I think.''. \n \n Seth cocked his head, pointing the chopsticks at his son in challenge: \n \n `` And what do *you* think?'' \n \n ``'Bout what?'' The kid reached out for the gyrgi pouch. Watching his son down the juice, Seth felt a pang of guilt - he promised Cyllia and Zack to get some Erzo aged water for dinner, but the prices kept going up. \n \n `` About the Melt Era. I'm really curious what they're teaching you nowadays. History, you know, is prone to warping... Watch it! That stuff stains''. \n \n `` Well, Mr. Kazidis just shows us stimvids, says we got ta `` figure it ourselves''. I said it's boring, because - well, it's painful to watch the documentaries and see how everyone was so stupid, wasted so much time'', Zack conceded finally. `` Like, why did noone stop in the 30's and realize that it was just the Ice Age ending? A normal cycle that Earth like, goes through? If the governments invested in the GAI thingy from the start, in habitats and stuff, we would n't have had the Bay Floods shit, we would n't have lost Japan and Hawaii...'' \n \n Seth nodded. The Melt Era was chaos incarnate. So much denial, so much blindness. Inadvertely, he looked back at his childhood, the scratch of hurt etched into his memory as he remembered his mother... her wide-eyed, *terrified* stare from the dim twilight of the room, the dust floating in their subter hub as she hid in the corner, clutching a blanket, afraid of *him*. She was a good mother, he knew it with both his hearts - but even now, he had no idea if she ever accepted what was done to her. If she accepted the reality of her own kid existing, fully and irreversibly. \n \n If anything, that was where the real trauma of the Melt lay. Forget the floods, forget the deaths, forget the destruction. But the gap left by the genome alteration initiative between generations could n't be repaired just as easy as the roads or the cities were. \n \n `` Mr. Kazidis says - everyone was so caught up in moralizing, the scientists became preachers. I do n't really get that part, about the preaching. He also said real preachers stalled GAI a lot''. \n \n Seth's lips curled up a fraction in a tiny sarcastic smile. \n \n `` They did. You see, climate was largely a speculative area. A place to prove oneself, take a name. When no-one knew nothing with certainty, it was easy to climb on the soapbox and proclaim yourself smarter than everyone. That's what preachers do, son. You do n't have to stand by the minbar to be self-absorbed''. \n \n `` I guess...'' \n \n `` Ranting about `` pollution'' was easier than accepting the reality of nature, anyway''. \n \n `` I do n't know, Dad. There's a lot of political recs, and oldweb archives, have to go through it all'', the teen grumbled, casting a longing glance at the windowsblinds. `` I kind of want to do a vee-ar chorr on Andre Bapt, he was a cool guy''. \n \n `` Who?'' \n \n Zack rolled his eyes. Yeah, he got it, Dad had a shitty education because he *worked* all his life, but come on! \n \n `` Bapt. The guy from Swizzerland, the one who started the plant modding program. Dad, how come you-''. \n \n Suddenly, a thundering pitter-patter crushed against the living room wall, sending the blinds shut as the house systems recieved an alert. Like a murmur, it spread, making Zack's face melt into the happiest grin. The chopsticks clattered on the kid's plate. \n \n `` Sandstorm, Dad! The guys' are pinging me *right now*, I'm out!'' \n \n *** \n \n Seth went outside too. In the hazy orange glow, he could see Zack running towards his friends, the wormsuit tucked under his armpit - a gangly figure cutting through the particle frenzy of the sandstorm. Zack yelled something happily at his buddies, his scales, milky-white, flushed close to his body and standing out boldly against the towering ochre waves of sand. \n \n The storm was a strong one. Despite the zenith, the sun above grew into a faint pinprick, covered by the great haboob cloud. \n \n As one, all the four kids dropped their wormsuits on the ground and jumped into them, allowing the nanosmart muscle-fabric to contract and fully encase their bodies into glossy, burrowing carapaces. A second - and where there were people, a pecuilar blend of creature and machine, ink-black manned trilobites. \n Dunesurfing in wormsuits was the hottest trend, and Seth could n't get nothing but the best for his son. \n \n Whatever history was, Seth thought, he hoped that Zack learned the most important lesson of them all - to be human is not just to adapt, but to *mod*. Earth does its wild things, animals adapt, and humans... well, humans are way above that, in all honesty. \n \n Licking the itching cornea of his left eye, Zack watched the teens dissipate in the dunes. Now, with his son out having fun, he could turn his attention to more immediate things. \n \n Cyllia was going to be back in a few hours from her beloved mold-gardens. Yes, two glasses of mescal and a sulfuric acid bath would do wonders. \n \n \n \n\n"}

Maybe he knew of some other cafe that had had someone else like me that walked in to their cafe, ordered an iced coffee, had both their credit and debit card declined twice each, payed with cash that had been half-ripped by an ATM, and requested that a second one be made for when the first one spilled. Maybe that one-in-a-million person had also \u2013 within the next ten minutes \u2013 suffered a third-degree burn from somebody's spilled drink, fallen through two chairs they \u2019 d tried to sit in, tripped over another customer \u2019 s untied shoe, smacked their head against the counter opening an annoying cut, had their first iced coffee overturned on their head by a barista while they got to their feet, and then told the embarrassed barista through casual conversation that they had set a world record by being struck by lightning forty-two times. Maybe \u2013 but I doubted it. \n \n He had offered me a rag to wipe myself off with and a box of bandaids. I had declined.

There was no one else in the cafe by now, so I sat at a table close to his register. He \u2019 d come over to sit down with me while he ingested my gruesome depictions of getting zapped by mother nature \u2019 s taser. \n \n \u201c Can you prove it? \u201d He asked. \n \n \u201c Nope.

I said. \n \n `` So... there's no proof that any of that happened?'' He asked. \n \n `` Scars, mostly. See, whenever I was lucky enough to get any medical treatment the records would be lost, my patient name would be switched, dumb things like that. \u201d \n \n I lifted up my shirt, and pointed at one of many ugly configurations of gruesome scar tissue. \n \n \u201c That was from lightning strike number... oh, thirty-something.

He shook his head for a number of seconds, and glanced at the barely legible name scrawled on the side. I pointed at it. \n \n `` See? Another way the universe has put me on permanent latrine duty.'' I said. \n \n \u201c Oh. Is your name really \u2018 Dick \u2019? \u201d \n \n I straightened up, and said, \u201c My birth name is Harry S.

Even if his mouth was firmly pressed shut, there was no hiding the convulsions of suppressed laughter that made his face turn the color of a brutally stabbed tomato. As a general rule, I view niceties as unnecessary burdens. \n \n I motioned with my hand, and said, \u201c Go ahead. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sa-Sackrider?! \u201d He sputtered. \n \n I let him heave with fits of asphyxiated laughter in his chair. I didn \u2019 t take offense \u2013 I couldn \u2019 t. Not anymore. Anyway, dignity is for suckers. That said, he regained himself with impressive speed. \n \n He handed me back my driver \u2019 s license, offering me his hand as well, and said, \u201c I \u2019 m... I \u2019 m sorry.

Are you really going to say no to me after that, and after dumping my own drink on me? \u201d \n \n He picked it up, and gave a cautious sip. Then another. \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s... that \u2019 s decaf. \u201d He said with a disgusted scowl, putting the cup back down. \n \n I smiled, and said, \u201c Well! Imagine that! So it is. \u201d \n \n He started to say something, but before he could get the chance the table wobbled. What little remained of drink number two fell over, spilling out on to my lap. Not a twitch, not even a flinch from me. I just turned my hand over as if to say, \u201c See? \u201d \n \n \u201c Shi... I mean, sorry! I \u2019 m sorry, that was my fault. I \u2019 ll get you another. \u201d He said with shocked embarrassment. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t bother \u2013 I \u2019 m good. \u201d I said, calmly retrieving a pair of dry jeans from my bag. \n \n I thought he was about to insist, so I held my palm up and shook my head. He shrugged, and went about wiping up the mess with a rag stashed in the pocket of his apron while I went to the bathroom to change. Half-a-minute later, I was sitting across from a speculative, slightly perturbed Derrick. \n \n \u201c So Derrick \u2013 let \u2019 s tally up my time here, \u201d I said, counting off on my fingers as I continued, \u201c Three spills, one hot, two cold; two magnetic strips that wouldn \u2019 t read; one gash; one cracked straw; you gave me decaf; and three falls, two from chairs that broke underneath me, one from a shoe lace; did I forget any - \u201d \n \n Chair number three's leg let out a crack, and buckled. I did n't react in time, and my back - a veteran of countless batterings - smacked the floor. I did n't suffer any serious injuries, but believe me when I say, `` Ow.'' In spite of this, I kept my thought train going in defiance, lifting my fist in a vague *up* direction for Derrick to see, and shout-sang, \u201c *make that three chairs, and a partridge in a burning peeeear treeeeeeee! * \u201d \n \n I \u2019 ll give Derrick some credit \u2013 he didn \u2019 t miss a beat coming over to help me back up. He returned to his seat, and I leaned against a section of nearby wall free from any overhanging pictures. He looked spooked. \n \n \u201c Okay... so life just sometimes happens to you. \u201d He ventured. \n \n I gave him a deadpan look, \u201c Life just happens, eh Derrick? \u201d \n \n *HERE WE GO. * \n \n \u201c Derrick... life... REALLY happens to me! Seriously \u2013 I get a rare, aggressive form of cancer when I \u2019 m eight, and get the Make-A-Wish Foundation to pay for a trip to a Disney. Before I get on to my first ride, I get hit by a diving bird so hard it knocks me and my knit cap in to a comatose state for a whole week! I didn \u2019 t get to go back because \u2013 good news \u2013 my cancer goes away. Bad news, because I got seriously sick or something from the damn plague bird! Don \u2019 t ask me how that works, Derrick \u2013 I don \u2019 t know! \u201d \n \n I found myself getting angrier, and angrier saying it out loud like this. I was actually yelling so loud I almost missed the sound of the bells attached to the cafe \u2019 s entrance. The front door had opened, and suddenly closed as someone quickly left. No doubt they suddenly remembered somewhere else they had to be, so I kept going. \n \n \u201c But you know what I do know? That manatees can get rabies! That a neighbor \u2019 s lit cigarette cherries can burn your house down, and everything you own while you helplessly watch! Twice! That no matter how fast you run, treadmills can spontaneously malfunction and insist you fall faster! That life \u2013 one way or another \u2013 laughs at the structural integrity of every apartment, vehicle, restaurant or port-a-potty you occupy! Guess how I know Derrick! GUESS HOW I KNOW! \u201d \n \n Derrick was handling the crazy man supporting himself with his hands on the table inches away from his face surprisingly well. He was leaning back slightly, but seemed sympathetic. He nodded slowly. \n \n *THAT \u2019 S IT DERRICK, FETCH THE STICK. * \n \n \u201c So... why do you go outside then? \u201d He asked carefully. \n \n I beamed at him, and resumed leaning against the wall. \n \n *HE SHOOTS... * \n \n \u201c Because I \u2013 like you \u2013 occassionally get hungry, Derrick. I \u2019 m starving, and somehow every kitchen appliance I \u2019 ve ever used has forgotten how to say \u2018 NO \u2019 to electrical fires. And I don \u2019 t know why, but most people seem to think that if they give me something, \u201d and I gave a long, long look at the pre-made sandwiches on display, \u201c like \u2013 oh, I don \u2019 t know, a few of those sandwiches on the top shelf to enjoy elsewhere \u2013 that when life decides to REALLY happen to me... \u201d \n \n I picked up a part of the most recently broken chair to display. I with satisfaction, and Derrick with dread watched as part of that part fell off to rejoin its fellows on the floor with a loud clatter. I dropped the rest for effect. \n \n \u201c... that life won \u2019 t REALLY happen to THEM too. \u201d \n \n Derrick was silent. Stunned, one might say. I meandered over to a towering shelf filled with expensive merchandise, and let my weight rest against the adjacent wall. \n \n I gave him a sad smile, and said, \u201c or anything else in the vicinity. \u201d \n \n His face went a beautiful, satisfying shade of white underneath the ugly shrub growing on it. \n \n *... HE SCORES! THE CROWD GOES WILD! AAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! * \n \n Two accident-free minutes later, he was opening the door for me. Not out of politeness, I \u2019 m sure. I held my bag of *donations* carefully at my side as I walked out, briefly turning to tip an imaginary hat to him. He just glowered at me. \n \n \u201c You, \u201d he said through gritted teeth, \u201c are such a colossal dick! \u201d \n \n \u201c A *well-fed* colossal dick, sir. Until next time! \u201d I said, turning to leave. \n \n I heard from behind me the furious, enraged, delicately precise and slow closing of the cafe \u2019 s front door.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Every ten years , you must go in front of a board of peers who will evaluate your life for you . If you do not `` Impress your peers '' you will be executed .\n","story":"I shifted somewhat uncomfortably in my seat. I hated sitting on these Liberty Card evaluations. Everyone had to sit on at least one a year, and more if you were singled out for being an exceptional individual. This was my fifth, and it was only August. I've never considered myself that exceptional, and my last review was only a SATISFACTORY PASS. \n \n Every 10th birthday starting at 15 we are evaluated for contributions to society. It was a idea that arose out of the conservative social programs of the late 2010s. Anyone whose contributions to society and the nation had their Liberty Card revoked. Although considered a voluntary program in practice, it had evolved into a lifestyle of necessity. Your LC gave you access to grocery stores, hospitals, heck, even the American Evangelical Church of Freedom - the richest megachurch chain in the nation - required it for admission. \n \n The modern evaluations were a mere shadow of their former purge-like vindictiveness. In the early days the evaluations we're run by diehards who looked for anyone who was not a patriot. My brother's 15th evaluation ended when he refused to sing the National Anthem. Now, as long as you're not a buzzhead or needler you at least got a SATISFACTORY PASS. If you were famous or rich, you usually got an EXCEPTIONAL PASS, which entitled you to free groceries and medical care - on account of your important contributions to society. \n \n Today I sat on the evaluation board for a young Stacey Pardova. 15, solid grades, and participated in soccer, drama, and cheerleading. She was set for a solid SATISFACTORY PASS, and depending on her performance in college she could see an EXCEPTIONAL PASS if she was admitted to one of the Evangelical Freedom schools and joined the Liberty Maidens team. \n \n `` Stacey, please be seated.'' The head evaluator was a young man wearing a navy suit and red tie. It was a little unusual for the head evaluator to be so young, but not unheard of... Wait. All the other evaluators were young men wearing navy suits red ties. \n \n `` Stacey, before we hand out your evaluation scores, it has come to the attention of your evaluation committee that you have dated a substantial number of boys at school.'' \n \n What? No it has n't come to the attention of me, and I'm on her evaluation committee. Stacey blushed and lowered her eyes, `` I was dating Jimmy Thomas for a couple months, but we only went to the movies together, nothing went on.'' \n \n `` We have records that show that you're lying. You have been found violating the Promiscuity Clause of the American Evangelical Church of Freedom. We have unanimously found you to be an UNSATISFACTORY member of society. You are not to be issued a Liberty Card. You are barred from attending an Evangelical Freedom school. So says your committee.'' Miss Padova's face paled at the decision, tears welling up in her eyes as a future full of hope evaporated in an instant. \n \n I could n't let this go on further. I stood up and addressed the committee. `` Excuse me, I do n't believe that is entirely correct. I submitted a review of Miss Padova of EXCEPTIONAL PASS, that does n't seem to have been factored into the decision.'' \n \n `` Your evaluation was not considered.'' He had been prepared for my interjection and was clearly pleased to deliver this news to me. The other members of the committee, their brass flag pins arranged perfectly on their breasts in order. \n \n `` The rules have been changed. Only members of the Patriot Forum are now allowed to deliver evaluations for the Liberty Council. Previous evaluations have been found to be lacking in the moral character we desire. Stanley Albrecht, we are not allowing to to sit on this committee, you have been in the evaluation process yourself. I am afraid that you have also been found UNSATISFACTORY by our committee.'' \n \n This was... I did not know what to say.'Unprecedented' might be the right word, but it did n't convey the right emotions.'Holy shit balls!' had the right emotions but not the right words.'Unprecedented holy shit balls' maybe. \n \n `` You have no right to evaluate me at this time. I am 27, my next evaluation is n't until 35.'' \n \n `` We know how old you are Stanley, and we are well aware of your connection to the revolutionary Peter Albrecht. We can not have such impure members in our civilized society.'' \n \n `` Peter? My brother? I have n't spoken to him in sixteen years. Not since he was refused his Liberty Card.'' I do n't even know where Peter was. He may as well have been dead. Our family ever spoke of him once after he left. \n \n `` As an affiliate of a terrorist, you are not to be allowed to retain the benefits of the Liberty Card. Furthermore, you are a threat to our nation's security. You are to be incarcerated until such time as the severity of your crimes can be assessed, and any accomplices can be taken in.'' \n \n He now turned to address both of us, together. `` Stacey, Stanley, you are both moral dangers to our society. The Patriot Forum is dedicated to eliminating such human waste as yourselves. You will suffer and die for your sins against us.''\n"}

It is the name on my birth certificate, my social security card, my drivers license, and my passport. My name is, and always has been, Nancy, yet for some reason I do n't understand, no one has ever called me Nancy. \n `` Good Morning, Jim.'' That's what I hear every day when I arrive at work. \n My Mom calls me Jim. My Dad calls me Jim. My teachers in Elementary, Middle, and High School all called me Jim. I do n't understand. Why Jim? I'm not even a man. \n I walk into Starbucks and order a tall caramel macchiato. \n `` Your name?'' the barista asks me. \n `` Nancy,'' I reply. \n 3 minutes later I hear, `` Tall Caramel Macchiato for Jim!'' \n I look around and see that no one else is waiting for their drink. It has to be mine. \n `` My name is Nancy,'' I tell the barista when I take my drink. \n `` Right, Jim, that's what I said.'' he responds. \n This has been happening my whole life and I have never been able to figure out why. Everyone I know and everyone I meet calls me Jim, even if I introduce myself as Nancy. I often wonder if it is some elaborate prank, or a joke that went too far and now no one knows how to turn back. The strangest thing is that when I correct them, like I did the barista, they do n't seem to hear me. They always say something along the lines of, `` Yes, I know your name is Jim. That's what I called you.'' I have dealt with this for 39 years but I have reached my breaking point. I want to shout from the rooftops, `` MY NAME IS NANCY!!!'' but I doubt anyone would hear me. They would probably just say, `` That's great, Jim.'' \n Every man I've ever dated has called me Jim. That's why I'm not married. I ca n't stand the idea of marrying someone who ca n't even call me by my name. I ca n't handle the man I love calling me Jim every day. And now 39 years later, I have had enough of Jim. I leave work early and as I hear my co-workers say, `` Have a good night, Jim'' and `` Hope you feel better, Jim'' I just get more and more ready to end it. Once home I grab a pen and pad of paper and begin writing my suicide note. `` My name is Nancy,'' I write, `` But nobody seems to know that. I am tired of being called the wrong name by every single person. I am tired of feeling like no one really knows who I am. I am tired of feeling so alone.'' I sigh as I sign my name and finally feel at peace knowing what I'm going to do next, but as I look over the letter to make sure it's just right, my heart stops. I read my first sentence over and over again in horror and confusion. `` My name is Jim,'' it says.\n"}

Upon looking at the screen you see that a service pack to update the program was downloaded 10,000 years ago but never installed .\n","story":"It had been decades since earth started to progressively deteriorate. It started with climate change, which was caused by our inability to see the long-term results of abusing earth's natural resources. Everything escalated when the resources' fast increase in scarcity started wars fueled by greed. Now, years after the patch, history before it is often compared to a rollercoaster. The higher we got, the slower we went and the closer we felt to a semblance of peace - then we reached the top, realised we were on the wrong track and the entire world was trapped in a spectucalar crash course. \n \n I was a computer scientist at CERN when it all started going down. CERN had managed to stay neutral for a while due to it's scientific status and Switzerland's strategic location. Of course, this could not last forever, as everything would eventually become a target as even these would become scarce. I still shiver when I consider how everything could have ended, had n't we found it. \n \n At the time, one of our best supercomputers was running an experimental program which tried'mapping' the internet, somewhat like what old search engines from the 2000's did before virtual reality became the norm. It was intended to make it possible to literally walk around in the internet, sorting all it's content in one comprehensive world. However, as the world around us started to fall apart, the program seemed doomed. Researchers started leaving because they felt their families were more important than a program which would most likely be useless by the time it was finished. With the increasing intensity of the war, server after server was destroyed and even the internet became smaller fast. \n \n Ironically, the regression of the internet highly increased the odds of our salvation - the needle in the haystack was found in time only because the haystack was not even 1\/4th of it's former size. What the supercomputer found was a server which was not connected to the'real' world in any way, a ghost server. The few remaining members of the research team were astonished as to how something like that was even possible, which is why we called it the God Server. \n \n At this time, I was the leader of the program and I had no family to return to. With nothing left to lose I went in, utilising a stage of the program which could not even be called the alpha version. Sensory experience was already highly evolved and possible in virtual reality, but since the program we developed ( to use a biological analogy ) was basically a fetus the world I found myself in consisted of an empty shell of nothingness with buggy, constantly shifting lines of code floating around me. I was near the'location' of the God Server, and when I finally got close enough to see it I was astounded. In front of me was a huge manor, encompassing more detailed beauty than even a final form of the program would have had. \n \n Hardly able to comprehend my situation, I stumbled through it's majestic entrance. I expected to enter into a hallway with many, many old doors leading into who knows where ( some of my later expeditions into the God Server actually turned out to be very similar to this ). Instead, I entered a singular room. As soon as I went inside, I just knew the door behind me was gone and surrounding me were 4 walls. The wall in front of me flickered a few times before turning into a screen. \n ____________________________________ \n **Dimension G42H, ADAM\/\/EVE patch 1.67** \n \n `` To prevent almost certain disaster, the altruistic drive in ADAM\/\/EVE has been artificially increased by a factor 2 to ensure it's prevalence over it's overtuned egoistic drive.'' \n \n **Patch ADAM\/\/EVE 1.67 requires restarting dimension G42H.

It is definitely past our ability to venerate - in a way, no religion was ever wrong.

All beautiful, young, women with something to lose. She had a loving husband, two young daughters, and even a good paying job as a real estate agent around town.

Have her live in the hearts and minds of her loved ones, her friends, her family, as the beaming, loving mother she was. Her death was no different either. I followed her, watched her as she closed up the last open house of the day, and went about my business. She lived with her husband and kids, but they were finally away. It was summer so the kids went to a camp, and who knows where her husband went, I did n't care just as long as he left. So I abducted her, set her in my basement, and bound her to the corroded pipes that still stood from floor to ceiling. What happened next well, I just did what I always did. Those last fleeting moments were always the most interesting to me, to watch their humanity unfold and witness as realization, fear, and acceptance took hold. My favorite part was always when they asked me questions: `` Why are you doing this? ``, `` what did I do? ``, `` how can I change your mind?''. They always pleaded but my mind was set, there was no absolution for them, except for my hatchet, of course.

For who would deny a cozy fire, warm food and the company of friends? \n \n `` Now you will get one more story tonight and not another, so what will it be?'' Old Cairn asked the children which eagerly sat upon the floor before him. A few of the adult's listened but they had all heard his stories a dozen times over. Instead, they talked of more important affairs such as once again lowering the rations in order to ensure the villages survival. \n \n `` I want to hear of the mighty Thorkill! My Pa says he could beat a bear with one hand.'' A young boy towards the front shouted. \n \n `` I want to hear about Princess Erist!'' A little girl in the back replied. \n \n `` What about the Ice Giants?'' Another boy meekly asked. \n \n `` Ah-ha! Now there is a fitting tale.'' Old Cairn exclaimed with hands raised. `` Let me tell you about Arngier, Last of the Frost Giants.'' \n \n The children quickly quieted, they knew better than to try and get Old Cairn to change his mind once a story had begun. \n \n `` Long ago, when the great Frost Giants roamed the earth. Winter was not a season, it was a way of life. The entire world was covered in ice. Everywhere, people froze or starved. Through the might of Thor, we humans were given hope as he struck down the Ice Giants one by one. However, there was one last titan that not even Thor son of Odin could match.'' \n \n `` Thor would n't lose!'' The same boy from earlier shouted in defiance. \n \n A crooked smile appeared on Old Cairn's face as he looked down at the boy. \n \n `` Ahh, if it were a test of might then you would be correct. But the problem was that the air was so cold in the mountains near the Arngier the giant, that mighty Thor could not get close enough to strike. Eventually, he realized that his struggle was in vain and left us humans to the mercy of the great frost giant.'' \n \n At this point, Cairn paused for dramatic effect, took a long gulp of his spiced wine and let the silence linger before continuing. \n \n `` All of humanity was thought to be doomed, but in a small village not very different that this. There lived a girl named Astrid. While this girls life seemed normal by most aspects, it was not. She was the most beautiful woman in the world. She realized that no man could vanquish the giant with martial might so she decided to try words instead.'' \n \n `` But would n't she just freeze?'' The girl in the back asked. \n \n `` I was getting to that!'' Old Cairn snapped, he did not like to be interrupted while telling a story. \n \n `` As you suggested, by the time Astrid had reached the giant. She was nearly frozen stiff. She could only utter the single word, `` Please.'' before collapsing at the giants feet. This got great Arngier's attention. He was moved by the girls bravery but more importantly, his frozen heart was warmed by her beauty. However, he was helpless to save her'' \n \n Once again, Old Cairn paused his story to take another sip of his wine. He slightly smiled has he could see the obvious agitation and impatience of the children who waited to hear the ending. \n \n `` A frost giant ca n't stop the cold, it is simply in their nature. This was especially true for Arngier who's winter breath was the coldest of them all. The only way to stop the freezing effect of a frost giant for good is to kill them.'' \n \n `` But I thought you said-'' The boy was quickly cut off as Cairn gave him a stern look. \n \n `` Knowing that the girl did not have much time.'' Cairn continued. `` Arngier did the only thing he could think of to save her. He grabbed his great sword and pierced his once frozen heart. Immediately, the dark clouds overhead dispersed and let forth the suns blazing rays. All over the world, the ice melted and once again farmers returned to their fields.'' \n \n Everyone was silent for a moment, eventually one of the kids spoke up. `` But.....what about Astrid? Did she live?'' \n \n Old Cairn smiled, this time he purposefully waited for them. `` According to legend, when the giant pierced his heart. It was no longer ice. Due to the love he had for Astrid, it became a bonfire and burst forth to revive the frozen girl. In fact, if you walked 3 days and 3 nights through the mountain range to the north. You will see the bones of Arngier, Last of the Giants and the great sword he pierced himself with.'' \n \n The children stared in stunned silence. The desire for adventure obvious in their youthful eyes. \n \n `` Now, begone. Go pester your parents for once.'' Old Cairn waved them away with a stern voice. Once he had driven the kids off, he closed his eyes and fondly thought of a distant memory. A memory of a younger man, who had adventured through those mountains in search of legends.\n"}

Singers, actors, politicians- they all cashed in their names. Perhaps too soon, trying to keep the lifestyles they had grown accustomed to.

I'm pretty qualified to listen,'' he half whispers. \n \n He's so calming. I mean, the church is calming. *He's* probably a serial killer or something. `` My conviction is as strong as ever.

It had been two years since he received the message from Sheila, on a fax machine in his old accounting office.

What it so bad that Sheila thinks we should leave Earth? Why Europa of all the moons of Jupiter? What have I given up to get here? A lot, it had turned out. After quitting his job a week later and losing his wife and 1 year old child, 5 months later, Phil had completely drained his bank account building this rocket and food for two people in the last two years. His wife had protested for 4 months before taking Stephen and leaving for her mother \u2019 s place, but she didn \u2019 t understand how urgent this was.

Phil looked around, checking off all the takeoff items he \u2019 d read online in his head. Clearing that list, Phil hit the second large button labeled IGNITION, and the rocket roared to life below them. Well, here goes nothing. The rocket began to push off the ground, as the entire structure began to shake and rattle around them. The rocket pushed higher and higher. Come on baby get us moving. \n Suddenly a huge CRRAACCK resounded below them. O no\u2026. \n The first rocket stage of the rocket suddenly exploded, letting off a huge orange and yellow explosion followed by a hollow but enormous boom.

Why, one time when I was eight, I had a dream that my mom bought me a Snickers bar, and the nextg day, when she picked me up from school, she had a Snickers bar for me. \n \n I fucking shit you not. \n \n I tell you this, so that you can imagine my thought process that led to the end of the world. \n \n It had always been a game: could I get to the microwave before it reached zero? I liked to pretend there was some sort of magical bomb that was linked to my microwave. I guess that thinking I was saving the human race was more exciting that thinking that my hot pockets were know a molten core of cheese teleported from the depths of hell -- even if they were the most fucking delicious snack known to mankind. I knew it was ridiculous at the time, but I still played along. \n \n Actually, that is a lie. Hot pockets are way the fuck better if you cook them in the oven. But, seriously, who has time for that? \n \n Anyway, I played the game, as I am sure you all did.

The bitch. I mean, fuck, if she didn \u2019 t want me running to get my hot pockets, then maybe she could have cooked them for me, right? The lazy ass fucking cunt-bitch. \n \n Anyway, back to the part where I tell you about how I ended the world\u2026 \n \n I was microwaving some hot pockets, and keeping track of the time on the microwave. But, I was also playing *Angry Birds* and those fucking pigs... god-damn those fucking pigs. They deserved to die. \n \n I knew that the microwave was going to go off... but... well what was the worst thing that could happen? The core of my hot pocket might cool the point that my tongue wouldn \u2019 t fuse to the roof of my mouth when I tried to eat them? \n \n And I was in a groove. \n \n So... I let it go. I let the timer reach zero. \n \n Fuck me. \n \n No... actually\u2026 fuck you. Because, odds are, if you are reading this you \u2019 re in a hospital dying of radiation poisoning. Because of those fucking pigs. \n \n The first thing I noticed, after the beep of the microwave, was a bright flash. It was the sort of flash that one might associate with lightning... if it wasn \u2019 t 2 in the afternoon and there wasn \u2019 t a cloud in the sky. \n \n I glanced out the window, and that \u2019 s when I saw it: a mushroom cloud poking over the horizon. \n \n You know how they say you can drop your gorilla glass phone, and the screen will be ok? They are fucking lying to you. \n \n Anyway, I stared at the cloud blossoming for like 30 seconds, thinking about how this was just a coincidence. I mean, World War 3 had to break out sometime, right? It might as well have been when I decided to let my hot pockets cool for once. Right? \n \n And that is when I remembered my biology class. Something about \u2018 hypothesis formation \u2019 and \u2018 hypothesis testing. \u2019 So\u2026I formed a fucking hypothesis and then I tested the fucker. \n \n I set the timer to 1 second, and let the microwave beep. \n \n A flash. \n \n Fuck. But... could it really be me? I mean, really? How? And, if WW3 had just broken out, wouldn \u2019 t it make sense there would be lots of bombs? I couldn \u2019 t be the one responsible, right? \n \n It's like how, when your windshield wipers synchronize with the blinkers of the turn signal in front of you. Its just... an accident. A freak bit of timing. \n \n And so... I tested again. And I got another flash. \n \n Fuck. \n \n And again\u2026 \n \n And again\u2026 \n \n And again\u2026 \n \n By about the 10th time, I was convinced that there was some sort of connection. Of course by then, the damage was done. \n \n If you are reading this, you are about the last 1\/10 of the human population alive on the planet. To you, I have a simple message: I am sorry. I was just doing what Mr. Sanders in 4th period biology suggested was the key to all of human knowledge. I didn \u2019 t mean to end the world.\n"}

Being slightly intoxicated, he coudl relax enough to simply observe and learn.

He had found it at a discount kitchen supplies and cutlery store. It had only costed him four francs after a bit of haggling. He suspected that the owner had taken the loss to be rid of his stuttering, unkempt persona from his store. It was not really a mirror, of course. It was a bowl. A polished, stainless steel bowl. But the warped reflection it produced helped him understand the constant tugging of his mind. Everytime he saw his and his surroundings' reflection in the bowl, he understood things a bit further. \n \n His landlady had smiled at him yesterday. She was a nice, portly elderly lady letting a room he stayed in. She had worried at his loosening grip on reality, his stuttering, his unkempt appearance even more than the twelve weeks his rent had gone unpaid. But now? He had understood even more. He had washed, shaved ( except for a goatee, his beard had grown, he could keep it, he thought it suited his new enlightened self ), dressed in some of his better clothes and had checked himself in the bowl. And understood more. He had thinned out - he looked more like a scarecrow than the powerful man he once was, in his youth. But that was not relevant anymore. He understood more now. He had gone to the bank to withdraw some funds. His pensions untouched for a long time, he was surprised at the amount of money he had.

The Parisian air was fresh in spring and a soft breeze filled the room with the thousand scents and sounds of the bustling city. Five floors up he had a nice view of the roofs and streets of the neighbourhood. \n \n The laws of physics exists only in my mind, he thought as he climbed through the window to fly for a bit.

I \u2019 d never even heard of someone with black eyes, let alone seen them for myself. But here he was, all the proof I needed. He slumped down in the chair with a small sigh, his face hinting nothing.

Including you, Mr. Jones. \u201d \n \n \u201c How- how do you know my name? \u201d \n \n \u201c There is a saying, Mr. Jones.'Eyes are the windows to the soul.' I have a habit that if I meet someone I do n't know, I look into his or her eyes on purpose. When my eyes lay on theirs, I can see much more than something so trivial as how they feel. I can see their true colour, their \u2018 inner self \u2019 if you will. I know everything about you, Mr. Jones. I know more about you than you do. \u201d \n \n \u201c \u2026Why are your eyes black, Mr. Smith? \u201d \n \n \u201c I have seen a lot of things. Things I would do anything to unsee. \u201d \n \n \u201c What kind of things? \u201d \n \n \u201c... Have you ever wondered what colour the eyes of the dead are? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well no, I haven \u2019 t, but I don \u2019 t see what that has to do with- \u201d \n \n \u201c Bodies. There were so many bodies, a whole field of withering flowers. Death stood before me with his scythe and chose to kill the ones closest to me. My eyes\u2026 they are the same colour as my wife \u2019 s. My children \u2019 s. My mother \u2019 s. My father \u2019 s. My comrades \u2019. Death might not have taken me, Mr. Jones, but I went with him all the same. \u201d\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A man shaves his head and finds it covered in symbols he did n't put there .\n","story":"Jeffrey Morrow had just returned home from a night out with his girlfriend Sarah. In all respects it was a good time for both of them, he had ordered a few drinks for both himself and Sarah; afterwards the two of them were loose enough for some dancing followed by a wonderful little meal at a local burger joint. Their bodies swayed in the nightlife and just as the two of them pulled up to his house she got a call. He fiddled his hand up her skirt as she giggled and swatted it away, smiling at him. Her blushed face, red with alcohol and embarrassment changed expression. \n \n The light she had the entire night was gone and Jeffrey tried to figure out what the phone call was about `` Everything okay?'' Sarah looked down into her lap with her fingers clutched around her phone. `` Yeah- everything is fine. Just my job calling again, I wish I could tell you a bit more about it but you know, government work.'' Jeffrey smiled and placed his hand on her head and slowly brought it over to her shoulder. `` Want me to drive you there?'' he said to the faintly smiling Sarah, she placed her hand gently upon the one that rested on her, looked him in his eyes `` No Jeffrey, i'll call a cab. \n \n Maybe if you wait up for me and do n't fall asleep we can have fun when I get back.'' \n She got out of the car and hailed a passing taxi cab that stopped in the empty late night street. Jeffrey smiled as she left and he placed a single hand on his chest, she looked back before getting into the car and winked to him. Before getting in though she shouted to him `` Make sure you shave that musty thing already, I already told you I like my guys smooth, and I'm talking about your head this time!'' the two of them laughed at each other silently and parted ways. She went into her cab and Jeffrey locked his car before spilling through his apartment door. He kicked his shoes off one by one until finally stretching all the way out across his couch just like his cat Milo. \n \n He sat there with his eyes closed as he ran his fingers across his thick curled hair, her words still stuck with him as he drifted. The deeper his fingers dug into the forest on his scalp the more he pulled and tugged on it as if to rip it off. Finally, he stood from his couch in a force of momentum and made his way to the bathroom with his naked feet slapping against the cold tile floor. Jeffrey turned on the shower so that steam filled the room and he washed his face with a few splashes of water before finally sticking his head under into the shower to wet it thoroughly. He slid open his bottom drawer and pulled out a single blade razor and began shaving off inch and ever thick inch of his black hair. This was the first time he had ever shaved his head off completely and the small patches that were now naked tingled. He touched his finer tips onto his head and rubbed around the smooth edges before continuing to streak his razor across the rest of his scalp. The razor dropped about a quarter of the way through and it clanged against the sink. Jeffrey was left staring intently at the image in the mirror, near the left upper edge of his bald head was a single empty circle. \n \n It looked like a tattoo that someone meant to color in with a sharpie marker, no bigger than a penny. He gripped the razor again and continued shaving away with his eyes fixed upon the circle mark. As more of his wet hair fell like black rain he began to discover more circles. There were two now, with one at each side of his head. The more he shaved the more circles he found with the rest behind located behind the first two in a row. He rubbed his fingers over his wet and completely bald head, his neck turned backward in the mirror as he counted under his breath. A total of 5 circles on each side of his head from the front all the way down the back with two slightly larger circles at the back of his skull. His neck cracked when he pulled it back too far to get a better view but despite his best efforts he could not get a full image of every single circle. He rubbed his fingers once more over the circles and when his finger tip entered the diameter of the empty circle he felt heat come from it. He jolted his hands away from the circle in shock, his fingers slowly went back with a trembling fear. Jeffrey positioned his hands to hover over his head so that each of his finger tips were over a single circle. Then at a count of three he pushed them down and held them there. \n \n The heat grew larger but never to a point of pain. He began to hear a strange noise like a washing machine running. With his fingers still in place he heard a opening sound behind him. He quickly turned around and the noise persisted but it was not coming from within his apartment, it was coming from him. For as he turned back to face the mirror he got a glimpse of an opening near the back of his head; a literal hole straight into his skull. He grabbed a nearby hand mirror and worked his shaky hands around so that he could get clear view. In the mirror he saw several metal coils dug into his hollow head with a blue light coming from within it. Heat was shooting from the back of the entrance and the coils were slowly spinning, he reached out a finger to touch it but was zapped by static coming from it. \n `` I'm sorry Jeffrey'' rang the voice of Sarah as he turned around blankly, mouth wide open. `` What-is this?'' Jeffrey barely muttered to her. \n `` It's the reset switch; in about a minute your memories will re-set.'' \n He fell to his knees instantly, shaking and crying as he smashed his fists into the tile with rage and confusion. \n \n `` I'm sorry Jeffrey; we had to make sure that you were capable of performing all your tasks, we had to do a field run.'' \n Jeffrey looked up holding himself tightly `` Our love was a test?'' \n Sarah began to be filled with tears `` No, I truly felt something for you; but you were never mine, they reminded me that.'' \n Jeffrey stood and smashed the glass `` Who told you that?''. \n Sarah straightened herself and looked away from Jeffrey. \n `` Not now Jeffrey, you do n't have time anymore.'' \n Jeffrey slid back onto the sink and slowly creeped onto the floor where he uttered the words `` But Sarah; one morning while you were sleeping I ran my fingers through your hair. You have them too.''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] There once was a man from Mars ; he liked to collect things in jars\n","story":"*There once was a man from Mars; he liked to collect things in jars* \n \n Jimmy had always been a bit hectic. His older brother always hated him for it. Whether it was the time he had been playing hockey with people far better than him and he snapped his ankle, or the time he got arrested for some very questionable pranks ( `` no one was hurt!'' ). Whether it was the jar of American change he kept, or the jar of pucks that *she* gave him, or the jar of money he stole from their dad ( `` it is n't a lot!'' ). He'd lie and cheat and play cruel jokes. Far from the older brother, who graduated from high school, and then from law school, and then founded his own firm, along with two other successful lawyers. No one really knew what fire had been lit inside Jimmy. No one really knew what would put it out. No one knew how it'd been lit in the first place; his father was an orderly man, working for his fair share in the little corner store; his older brother was an incredibly successful lawyer. And so, they watched Jimmy collect pucks and money and pranks and flirts and kisses in jars. \n \n *He lived amongst the stars; He watched from afar, collecting memoirs* \n \n Then, when the older brother got sick, Jimmy moved to him. He had always loved his brother. His brother had done so much, from getting him out of a possible prison stint ( `` nobody was hurt, alright! `` ), to lugging him home when he was drunk countless times. Jimmy got a job at the brother's firm, more of a pity job than anything. He was okay. He was earning money. Getting his act together. He took care of his older brother; he understood his peculiar condition ( an allergy to electricity, for christ's sake ) better than anyone else. Then, he passed the bar exam. He was living in the lawyer capital of America, and he'd passed the bar! Jimmy was ecstatic! His brother far from it. He told the other two partners not to hire him; he was simply too dangerous, a liability. He could never be a good lawyer, after all. Jimmy, newly graduated, quit the post office job at the firm. He started his own firm. He watched all of his colleagues from afar, watching their stories. He was a public defender, and a damn fine one, office at the back of a nail salon. \n \n *He sat and played his guitar; the people gave him scars* \n \n Then, when he found a *big* case, a real big one, and brought it to his dear friend, who worked at the firm, he still was n't hired. She was a kind girl, the same one that gave him all those pucks. She really threw a fit over it. She loved him, cared for him, she truly did. She was on his side. He loved her too. Everybody could see the love in his watery blue eyes, the love in her city-like grey ones. But they never told each other. He'd touch her hand `` accidentally'' so much; she'd linger just a touch too long when she hugged him. It was n't long before he figured out his brother was the one telling them not to hire him. `` ^I ^thought ^you ^were ^proud ^of ^me, `` he whispered, voice breaking. The older man just sat there, an ugly look on his face and looked through him. Jimmy had never felt younger. He had just wanted him to feel proud. She hugged him when he told her about all this, on a skating rink of all places. She kissed him, too. Together, they went to her apartment, not Jimmy and his brother's shared house. She gave him her guitar. He played some wonderful tunes. He'd always been hectic, but the music centred him. Soft, gentle. His hands danced around the fretboard. Together, they listened. \n \n *He was now a superstar; he drank at bars* \n \n But that was not the end of Jimmy and his hectic ways. Of course not. He was Jimmy. The fire in him would never be put out. He got better and better as a lawyer. Better, and better, and better. More famous. But he also became more of a crook. She far from agreed with his ways. `` It can get you disbarred! You could *get killed*.'' It hurt her to see Jimmy change so much, again. He'd been so reformed. From the far too risky child, to the drinking, pranking, arrested teenager, to this young man. This young man, with clear blue eyes, and the proper haircut. She loved that young man. She loved Jimmy to death. He'd moved back home, to Toronto, for her. ( She'd gotten a job at the Toronto branch of the firm ). So it terrified her to see him getting involved with drug dealers, being their business partner, essentially, for a great deal of cash. He could die because of them. He hated seeing her so upset. How angry she got when he stayed out too late. She'd stayed. She'd stayed when no one else had. He had n't spoken to his brother in over three years. She stayed through him becoming more and more sketchy and dubious. He loved her a lot too. He pulled her closer every night, kissed her gently. He did n't want to lose her. Ever. He promised her things, but rarely came through, to be quite honest. But she still stayed, playing shinny and skating with him, and kissing him and loving him, and watching movies. He felt so, so lucky. The fire inside of Jimmy was roaring. \n \n *And when he got on their radar; he turned into a pulsar* \n \n Then, the fire finally burned too bright. Jimmy was shot, one day. Because of those pesky drug dealers. He cried when he saw her. He begged her for forgiveness. He sobbed. ( She hated it when he cried. She said it looked like his eyes were spilling over, being such a watery blue. ) He sobbed even though it hurt his ribs so much. He grabbed onto her hand, and he never wanted to let go again. She sat there and took it. Told him how fucking stupid he was. She squeezed his hand. She told him about the hockey game she just played, and the game their favourite team was playing. She told him about all these little good things, and he cried he was so relieved. But of course, the fire had to take him away. He suddenly could n't breathe that night. He was bleeding internally. He rattled her awake, and she called a nurse and a doctor and all the doctors. She screamed and shouted and fought for him. She was his fire department. But it was n't enough. The fire finally burnt out. He took a finally breath, pure, pure fear in his eyes, like a little kid. \n \n He did n't want to die. Jimmy really did n't want to die. She finally let tears run down her face. And then she called his brother. The partners. His friends. His brother and the partners came. The brother finally felt guilty for the things he pulled. His mother had told him to protect Jimmy, and he had *failed*. Jimmy had loved him so much. And he had n't. He cried a bit that day too. The partners said their condolences. She pressed a last kiss to his lips. And when the day came around, they buried him. It was n't fair. It was n't fair at all. Few things ever are. \n \n *And to fix a pulsar; you ca n't do CPR* \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n Is this based off of Jimmy McGill\/Saul Goodman? Yes. Do I regret it?

Among the crowd of frozen people in the city you see someone else also moving .\n","story":"Amelia swore as she looked at the clock. It was **5:45am** and work started in fifteen minutes. Quickly she pushed off the covers and jumped out of bed. Without even looking at the mirror she shoved her hair into a messy bun and then reached for the toothbrush. The alarm was still going off, shouting the loud monotone electric beep that haunted anyone with who had to wake up before the sun decided too. \n \n *Monday's usually start like this: rushed and panic. If I would just go to bed a little earlier, this would n't happen, * she thought as she spit out the minty glob into the sink. \n \n She glanced at the clock again. **5:50**. There was no way she was getting there on time. Her brown curly hair was a disaster, her pajamas were half off, makeup from the night before was smeared around her eyes making her look like a raccoon who had just climbed out of the garbage can, and there was a line of spit running down her chin. \n \n She closed her eyes and weighed the option, the alarm still ringing. *I swore I would n't do this. I did this all throughout college. I used this to study more for exams. I even used this to cheat on that Psychology exam freshman year. I vowed that I would n't use this to help me in my career. * \n \n **5:51am** \n \n *But it's just because I'm late. * Amelia thought. *It's not actually helping me in my career. It's just not letting me slip. This is n't cheating. This is just getting to work on time, that's all. * \n \n **5:52am** \n \n She brought both her thumbs to her middle fingers, closed her eyes and snapped. The alarm stopped. The honks of the cars stuck in traffic just outside her apartment window five floors down stopped. The shouting from the angry couple above her stopped. The dog barking at the bikers swerving around pedestrians stopped. Amelia glanced out the window just to make sure. Everything stopped. \n \n As she brushed her hair, rubbed her face with the make up remover wipes, as she slipped into one of her favorite dresses to wear to work, put on her shiny black high heels she enjoyed the silence. The irresistible relief that follows from being in full panic mode. Having the ability to stop time was never an easy secret to keep and it burdened her in many ways, but allowed her to do everything she had to do... like get to work on time. \n \n Back in college her friends always wondered how she was so rested, completed all the work she needed to do, maintained a 3.9 GPA, and had time to go out with friends. She did n't know how it worked. She was n't sure if she was borrowing time from her own life or from someone else's, or if it even worked like that. But she could stop time. Amelia began feeling guilty. She was the ideal college student, but there were others who were struggling. She had this gift, she was basically cheating. She'd been using this ability ever since she learned to snap. \n \n They'd been practicing snapping for a concert performance in the fourth grade. The first time she snapped was the first time it happened and it made her so scared that she was sick. Everyone around was singly loudly, but the moment she snapped the noises stopped. She thought she was stuck there. She thought she could never leave. But soon discovered, she enter real time and stopped time with a snap of the fingers. \n \n She locked the doors to her apartment and quickly walked down the stairs, brief case in hand and lunch in the other. It was a short walk to work, about ten minutes probably, but it did n't really matter. \n \n Amelia dodged the frozen people and glanced at them only for a second. She passed one man with a donut halfway into his mouth, another lady with a frown and her mouth open wide with her cell phone up to her ear. She looked very angry. There was a little girl holding onto her dad's hand tightly. Her eyes were wide like she was scare. Remembering that she did n't have to rush, Amelia stopped and turned around. This was the beauty of the power. She could observe the amazing presence of people. Each one has a story. Each one was thinking. And each one was frozen. They were caught in a split second that not even they will remember what they were thinking, what they looked like, or the exact position of their feet in a few seconds. It was a masterpiece. It was beautiful. \n \n As she watched the busy intersection, glancing over the still picture before her, something caught her eye. Nothing ever caught her eye when time was frozen. Nothing was *supposed* to catch her eye. \n \n *What was that? * Amelia asked herself and set down her briefcase. \n \n `` Hello?'' she called out. Her voice echoed off the tall city buildings. She waited for a reply, but there was none. \n \n *It must just be my eyes playing tricks on me, * she thought to herself, picked up the briefcase, and then continued walking to work. Then she saw something that terrified her. There was someone walking towards her. She stopped, her eye widening. She was n't sure whether to run, scream, begin time again. She did n't know what to do. A million options raced through her mind long enough that the man had reached her by the time she had even considered any of them. \n \n He was wearing a grey hoodie, darks jeans, and Nike shoes. His hand were tucked into his front pockets, and he was wearing a smile that she did n't know was menacing or kind. His eyes though. They were green and twinkled like the stars in the summer night sky during the weeks she used to spend on the farm at her grandparents house. \n \n `` I found you,'' he said quietly, hushed, as if what he said was fragile and could break if it was n't said just in the right way. Amelia frowned with fascination and confusion. \n \n `` You found me?'' she asked as she reached out to touch him. She was n't sure if he was real or not. She pulled back her hand just as she was getting close. \n \n `` I've been looking for you. I do n't know who you are, but, but I knew you existed.'' \n \n `` I'm sorry, what are you talking about? How are you *here*?'' Amelia inquired. \n \n `` Oh, you mean, frozen in time that is,'' he answered with a smirk. Amelia nodded. \n \n `` Yes. Of course I mean frozen in time. I'm supposed to be the only one here.'' \n \n `` You can call me Jason.'' \n \n `` Okay, *Jason*. I'm supposed to be the only one here.'' \n \n There was a pause as he looked around. He squinted at her then looked around. Amelia sighed. \n \n `` Can you please answer my question?'' \n \n `` Okay, I'll give it a shot.'' \n \n `` Please do.'' \n \n `` I exist in frozen time. This,'' Jason said, holding his arms wide out and spinning around, `` this is all I know. You see, you know two worlds. The world you live in with other people, and the world you live in with no one... well actually, me.'' \n \n `` So what are you saying? You're world is frozen. What are you talking about? I'm the only person you've ever met?'' she asked incredulously. Jason laughed, flashing a beautiful smile. \n \n `` No. I live in frozen time. Amelia, you're not the only one that can freeze time. I do n't know how this works anymore than you do.'' \n \n `` What happens when I unfreeze time?'' Amelia asks. \n \n `` I disappear from your world. You ca n't see me anymore.'' \n \n `` And what happens to you?'' \n \n `` I jump around from various people locations who freeze time. I stay there until they unfreeze time. I've made some very good friends. When you freeze time though, I always seem to jump to your time. You're different than me. I do n't need to sleep or eat. I'm always awake, moving from frozen settings to another. I appear when you snap your fingers.'' \n \n `` But where do you appear?'' she asked, trying to wrap he mind around this mysterious man. \n \n `` I've been trying to find you for *years. * I used to jump to NYU all the time. I could never find the person that froze time. Then after that I started jumping the New York City a lot. But those jumps stopped, I'm assuming because you stopped freezing time, right?'' \n \n Amelia nodded. \n \n `` I've been hunting down this person in New York that has been freezing time and it's you.'' \n \n `` What do you do when I do n't freeze time?'' she asked. \n \n `` Well, I just came from Paris.'' \n \n `` Paris, France?'' \n \n Jason nodded. Amelia could n't catch a thought and put it into words. Her questions were like fireflies, always escaping through her fingers. She decided to bail. \n \n She ran as fast as she could away from Jason. He did n't follow her, only laughed. \n \n `` I get it! You're scared! I'll probably see you later!'' he shouted at her. \n \n She entered the bathroom at her work and slammed a stall door, breathing heavily and slightly sweaty. After she regained her composure she snapped her fingers. Noise returned to her ears and she walked out of the bathroom. Amelia turned her wrist and took a breath. \n \n **5:52am** \n \n \n\n"}

This time there actually is a monster .\n","story":"It's the third time this week. \n \n I'm staggering toward my daughters room as she calls out my name. \n \n I crack the door, the nightlight still brighter than the rising 5am sunlight, causing me to squint behind sleep laden eyelids. \n \n `` What is it Honey?'' \n \n Daddy it's here again! Please find it! I'm so scared, I ca n't look! \n \n This has become a ritual lately.

She points under the bed this time, for the first time. Not the closet, or the toy box. Although she's previously been unaware of the exact location of her fears, this time it seems she's certain. \n \n I give her a thumbs up and a gentle pat on the knee as I approach the bed, reassuring her that I'm here for her. \n \n I reach down and lift the bed skirts, with a final look of confidence to my daughter before I delve into what she believes is the underworld. \n \n In my boxers, I go down to my knees, a shiver running down my spine. Surely because of the winter climate, I assure myself, anxious to get back to my warm goose down comforter. \n \n I lean down and peer under the bed, greeted by nothing but old twizzler wrappers and neglected Bratz dolls. I observe the scene long enough to ensure confidence in my daughter, and dismiss the strange rattling and buzzing noises as the AC unit that is right outside her window. \n \n I glance up to my daughter to assure her there's nothing there, but she insists there is immediately and proceeds to request that I delve underneath the bed and clear all of the items so that she can sleep soundly. \n \n I proceed, sleepily, lazily, to drag all of the items out from under the bed so that my beloved will sleep easy. \n \n As I'm clearing the last of the rubble from the depths of her twin bed it hits me, a sudden jolt, I panic, unsure of how I should handle the situation, my hand still writhing, unsure of how to control my discovery. \n \n I jerk back, and upon realizing that I've scared my daughter with my surprise, I reassure her and reach back into the depths. \n \n My hand encounters the force again. I ca n't make it out clearly, with sleep in my eyes. It struggles, and tries to wrestle away from me. All I can make out is a deep black force, moving of its own accord, slippery and malevolent. \n \n I ca n't let my daughter see my fear. I reach in with my other hand, and muster my entire willpower to grasp with both hands the darkness lying within. \n \n As soon as I have a hold on it, still writhing, trying to escape, I yank it from under the bed and immediately rush to the doorway, with a halfhearted word of encouragement to my daughter. \n \n With no preparation for the situation, my first instinct is to rush to my bedroom where my wife lay sleeping, the mysterious force still writhing and trying to escape at every turn. \n \n I burst into the bedroom, still unable to disarm the foe, and wake my wife alarmingly. \n \n `` YOU LEFT YOUR FUCKING DILDO IN APRILS ROOM!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You live in a world where technology is devolving\n","story":"`` I do n't understand why we have to do this,'' I whined as I grabbed the desktop computer and started carrying it towards the front door of our house. \n \n `` It's for our own good'' my mother said, following behind me with her laptop. \n \n `` But I'll miss playing games and using the internet!'' I said. `` Ca n't we just secretly keep one of our computers?'' \n \n `` I do n't think you understand how important this is'' said my mother - `` besides, the internet is going to be switched off at the end of the week, so what would you even do with your computer?'' \n \n We reached the sidewalk and dropped the computers there, where they made disheartening crunching sounds as they hit the pavement. \n \n `` I miss my smartphone, this is stupid'' I said. \n \n `` Stop it, Jim. Humanity has learned from its mistakes and you need to realize that. We spent so many centuries building up our technology, with the goal being to improve our ease of living and our *convenience*, but technology drove us apart and made us numb ourselves with self-medication through the internet and constant stimulation. Technology was like heroin for us, we just became addicted and it ate our souls away. Now, we are prioritizing our happiness, and will keep rolling back the clock until we are all happy.'' \n \n I sighed. But inside I saw some insight in what she said - every day I felt some underlying sense that something was just a little bit *wrong*, as if my life was n't quite what it should be. However, as we walked back towards the house I realized that this underlying sense of unease had n't really changed when we got rid of the smartphones, and it had n't really changed when we got rid of the computers either. Maybe it was the TV's fault. Or the car's fault. \n \n I did n't like the feeling though, and I did n't like thinking about. Worst of all I did n't like the fear that it would follow me no matter how much junk I threw away. As I entered the house again I eyed our appliances with suspicion, wondering which one might be able to take the blame for my unease, and hoping with slight desperation that discarding the right one might be the key to peace of mind.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A father gets sucked into the world of his son 's favorite video game and has to rely on his meager knowledge of it to survive .\n","story":"*OK... calm down. Do n't panic. Think. Use your brain. Figure it out rationally. You can do this. * \n \n Dan wiped his damp, quivering palms on his sweatpants as he took in his surroundings. He'd already confirmed that he was n't dreaming; a stinging, red welt on the back of his hand from when he pinched himself a little too hard told him that this was all real. \n \n For some reason, he was standing in a small, wooded area devoid of any signs of life. What appeared to be apple-like fruit hung from a nearby tree, but they did n't seem to be anything he'd ever seen before. He looked up at them, pondering whether or not to try one, when suddenly, the brush to his left quivered violently before a blur of yellow streaked out right below his knees. Flailing his arms in a vain attempt to keep his balance, Dan yelped as he crashed to the floor, landing on his tailbone with a painful *WHOMP*. \n \n Tears filled his eyes, blurring his vision as he grimaced and yelled in a labored, cracked voice: `` Hey, pal! Watch where you're going. You in a hurry or someth --...... What the!?'' \n \n It was yellow and furry, with a tail curiously shaped like a lightning bolt. Sparks flew from its bright red cheeks as it skidded to a halt in a cloud of dust, quickly turning around before glaring menacingly at the man struggling to get to his feet. \n \n His son often talked about these things. What were they called? Pokaymans? Were n't they supposed to be part of a video game? Nothing but questions and confusion swirled through Dan's head as he rigidly propped himself up. His conviction that he was n't dreaming promptly began to crumble as he stared back at the small creature that was growling aggressively with its tail arched high into the air. Perhaps he'd stumbled into its territory or too close to its young. \n \n `` Uh... *ahem* sorry about yelling, I guess...?'' Dan's cheeks flushed hotly as he realized he had just apologized to an animal of some kind. Still, it was the best he could muster as his mind reeled from trying to rationalize what exactly was going on. He slowly began to back away, hoping to avoid any sort of confrontation, when he bumped into what felt like an oversized pillow. He whirled around a little too quickly as needles prickled his back, reminding him that being middle-aged meant swift, sharp turns were best left to his memories of his ball-playing days in college. \n \n It was a pink beach ball wearing shoes, and it had a face. Utterly bewildered, Dan momentarily forgot about the pokaymans behind him as he gaped in disbelief. Surely, an animal like this never existed in the real world... or so he thought. The beach ball stared back at him, blinking benignly. \n \n Dan raised his hands in what he hoped was a non-threatening manner as he continued to gawk at the pink sphere in front of him. The last thing he needed was to be caught between two strange beings that might want to hurt him somehow. Much to his relief, the thing smiled brightly and began waving stubby little appendages up and down while bouncing on the balls of its feet. \n \n `` Hii\u2014ii\u2014ii!!'' \n \n `` Oh, thank goodness you can speak. I was worried for a moment that --...'' \n \n Without warning, the beach ball opened its mouth wider than should've been physically possible as a deafening *whoosh* filled Dan's ears. His feet flew out from under him as he hurtled toward the small sphere-like creature's mouth, his fruitless attempts to anchor himself to the ground ending with a feeble scratch at the dirt before he was completely airborne. \n \n Yet, just as he began to think that his life was over, how he wanted to see his wife and son, and how he had n't even finished paying off his house, he was soaring through the air again, albeit now in the opposite direction. As he shot toward the angry-looking pokaymans, he glanced back at the beach ball. Interestingly, it now had a brown head of hair, coincidentally styled like his own, and a pair of glasses that looked exactly the same as his. \n \n There was no time to brood any further, however, as a crackling sound filled his surroundings while his hair began to stand on end. The yellow pokaymans was glowing a brilliant, sparkling blue, evidently preparing to release a blast of lightning right in his direction. \n \n Dan closed his eyes, sure that he would not survive this time around. Right before the electricity hit, he could've sworn he heard a voice that sounded unexpectedly like his son's, yelling something that did n't seem to make any sense. \n \n. \n \n. \n \n. \n \n `` What the heck!? Why did my Kirby just take out a TV and start sleeping in front of it!?'' \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Tell us the tale of bootlegging and speakeasies in this troubled time of prohibition .\n","story":"I found myself driving out to the middle of the desert at 3am yet again. It something I had gotten use to by this point. I was out to get a shipment that came every week for me directly from the big boys, McDonald's. They had managed to stay a float these few years by going underground and making deals with people like me, people with nothing left to loose. When you live in a world where a burger is more illegal than drugs something got to be done about it. That is why I do this. \n \n \n `` Hey why are we going to a different location today.'' My partner suddenly said breaking the silence we had had for the past 30 minutes. \n \n \n `` The feds where spoten checking out the place.'' I told him as I reached for my cigarettes. \n \n \n `` What! Why did n't you tell me this before.'' He said really worried. He he was always like this afraid to take risks. I would question why he was in this business if I did n't know his circumstances better. \n \n \n `` Do n't worry about it,'' I said exhaling smoke. `` The spot this week is farther in to the desert where the cops are too lazy to search, everything is fine.'' \n \n \n `` How can you be so sure.'' He said \n \n \n `` Look calm down everything will be fine.'' I told him. `` Want I cigarette.'' \n \n \n `` No I do n't smoke and you know that.'' He said. \n \n \n Everything got silent again. It was always like this. Luis was n't much of a talker and always nervous. I know he would n't be in this if he did n't need the money to pay for his sons treatments. That's the reason I got him into my business to help him. \n \n \n `` There is a light over there.'' Luis suddenly said braking my train of thought. \n \n \n `` That's our stop.'' I said throwing my cigarette butt out the window. \n \n \n I pulled out to the side of the lights source. It was a ram with a trailer in the back much like the one I had.I got out of the car and began Walking towards to men that where in the back. \n \n \n `` You got all the stuff.'' I told them as soon as I got close. \n \n \n `` Yeah, 2093 of the finest big macs we could make.'' one of the men said as he opened the trailer. It was full of wrapped burgers. \n \n \n `` Well then here is the money.'' I said pointing at the suit case Luis was holding open. `` 41,260 dollars all used bills.'' \n \n \n `` Well it was a pleasure doing business with you yet again.'' One of them said as held his arm out. I also began to extend my arm when suddenly the guy next to him pulled out a gun and shot Luis right in the head. I began to run back to my car but he shot my leg an I fell face first to the sand. They both began walking to me. \n \n \n `` The boss heard about the deal you made with Burger King.'' The man that shot me said. `` He is n't happy you double crossed him.'' \n \n \n `` What do you mean I was just offering selection for my customers.'' I said to him as my leg left a small puddle of blood on the sand. \n \n \n `` You call tampering with our burgers to make them look good offering selection.'' The other guy said as he through me one of the burgers I sell to my face. I had been found out. \n \n \n I began to crawl away. The guy shot me in the other leg. I kept crawling however hoping I could get to my gun that was in my car. I was an idiot leaving it there. My father always told me to be prepared for anything. He was a great man taking care of me even after mom died. Many times he told me not to get into these types of businesses yet here I am dying the same way he did. Like a dog out in the middle of no where because of a deal gone bad. The guy shot me again on the right arm I was using to push my myself through the sand. Then he shot me on my left arm. He kept shooting my arm and my legs. The pain I felt was horrible. \n \n \n `` Alright that's enough.'' The other guys told him. `` We do n't want him to die right now.'' \n \n \n `` Alright.'' He said putting down the gun. \n \n \n He got close to me and began searching my pockets, I could n't do anything to stop him. He pulled out my keys and tossed them to the other guy. They both got in the cars and drove off leaving me out in this desert bleeding to death. I guess it's a death well deserved now that I think about it. I lived a life of crime killing people, Stealing, but worse of all lying to people. People like Luis who laid dead a couple of feet away from me. I used him as nothing but a pawn in my scheme to get richer no matter the cost. Why did I do this in the first place. To show off or was it to prove something. I did n't even comply my father's dying wish. For me to be happy. \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The last dragon in existence is trying to find a safe place to lay her eggs in today 's modern world , but several governments are in pursuit .\n","story":"He was coyote, just a thief in the night. He had no misconceptions about who, or what he was. He was n't ashamed of it either. He was a good thief, an honest thief. When he took a job he carried it out and delivered exactly as promised. And he was a strong Wer, not as strong as some, but stronger than most. Strong enough, and smart enough that there was little danger of him wering out. Overall he had a good reputation and generally business was good. \n \n \n This new client though, she puzzled him a bit. Definitely a straight, which was not entirely unheard of for his clientele, but unusual. She really had not wanted to meet him at his `` office'', which is what he called the bar at which he generally conducted his business. That was understandable really. She did not sound like she came from this part of town. The strange part was when he told her that, sure, it could be a little rough but he could protect her, she just laughed. She assured him she was capable of protecting herself. And for some reason, he believed her. He had never heard a more confident voice in his life. Finally though she had agreed but she would get back to him with the time. \n \n \n Ten minutes ago he got the message to meet her here, now. So here he was, cold beer in hand, sitting at a dark table in the back of the bar at an hour that tends to produce only the very best, or very worst of memories. \n \n \n He knew the moment she stepped in it had to be her. He keyed up his senses a bit and he could smell the slightest hint of her perfume, it was rose with a touch of cinnamon. This women clearly did not belong in a place like this. Good, perhaps that would shake her confidence a little, put him in a better bargaining position. \n \n \n As she walked past the bar a gorilla of a man took notice of her. When a face like his wears a smile like that, nothing good can come of it. Perhaps meeting here was n't the best idea. He said something to her, but she ignored it and made to step past him. He stood up and took hold of her arm. Shit, the coyote thought, as he rose from his chair. \n \n \n The woman turned to face the gorilla man so he could no longer see her face, but she clearly said something, though he could n't make out more than a hiss. The man, looking much less like a gorilla now quickly let her go and sank back onto his bar stool. She turned and headed towards their table. \n \n \n She was tall, her flaming red hair seemed to dance around her face with a life of its own. She was, by no means fat, but you would not have described her as thin either. She had long legs, covered by an emerald green dress that had designs sewn into it in gold thread. She wore a heavy golden necklace with an amulet inscribed in a language he did n't recognize. Her face was sharp and striking, her eyes were polished amber, blazing and unreadable. She was beautiful, he decided, but not like anything he had ever considered beautiful before. \n \n \n He stayed standing until she got to the table, where he offered his hand. She ignored it and sat opposite him. He took his seat and picked up his beer. \n \n \n `` Can I get you anything?'' He asked, more out of politeness than any expectation that she would actually drink with him. \n \n \n `` Scotch,'' she said, her voice carried a heat to it he had not picked up on over the phone. `` A double, no ice.'' \n \n \n Okay, He thought to himself, if she was going to drink like that, this could get interesting. When he got back from the bar she took the glass and drank it down like it was water. \n \n \n `` Have the girl bring another, then sit down. I do n't have much time.'' She spoke like someone accustomed to giving orders. Not like some spoil uptown women use to servants, this was more like a military officer giving commands and expecting them to be followed. \n \n \n He did as he was told. \n \n \n She handed him a card with several lines of text on it. A couple of names, addresses, various other information. He looked it over as she spoke. \n \n \n `` There is a scroll that I have, a need for. This is all the information I have as to where it might be. It is very old, you must be very careful with it.'' Her voice could melt steel, and there was an urgency to it when she spoke of the scroll. \n \n \n `` How valuable is this thing?'' He asked setting the card aside. \n \n \n `` That does n't concern you.'' She said with a slight wave as she finished off her second drink. \n \n \n Okay he thought, now was the time. She had to be drunk, though she did n't really show it, and he needed to impress upon her that he was not someone you could push around. A low growl started in his chest, his teeth began to grow and his snout lengthened. Time to let her know what it meant to deal with a Wer. \n \n \n He bared his teeth, just a bit and deepened his growl. Normally this scared the hell out of the straights, which is exactly what he was looking for. \n \n \n First, she almost smiled, almost. Then her eyes grew hotter, and, how had he not noticed that her pupils vertical slits, like a cats? He felt her hands cover his paws. When he looked down he saw claws, talons really, coming out of scaled hands. He looked back to her face. There was the faintest trail of smoke curling up from her nostrils. \n \n \n `` Growl at me again little dog and I will have you fixed.'' Her voice had deepened and carried a fiery heat along with her words. She clicked one talon lightly on the table to emphasize her threat. \n \n \n If he had grown a tail at that point, it would have been firmly tucked between his legs. When he looked up again her eyes, still burning amber, were back to a human shape. She released his, now also human, hands and leaned back. \n \n \n He had to clear his throat twice before he spoke. This was the strongest Wer he had ever met, likely ever would meet. And in his line of work, that was saying something. \n \n \n `` They're looking for you.'' He finally managed to whisper. \n \n \n `` I know that. That's why I need that scroll. Do you want the job or not?'' \n\n"}

They work effortlessly well together. \n \n Unfortunately, them being villains, they do n't have what I have. The will and determination to stop evil and protect my world from no good scum. Jaguar Power closes in fast while Cancer Crab is a little slower. It's time for a ricochet. I may be pulled down by my hair but my hands are still free. I grab one of my spectacular ricochet frisbees and launch it at Jaguar Power. \n \n He easily dodges. But I knew he would. The ricochet frisbee continues further down the club and smashes into Dorvis' tits. Making his laser beams go off. Everyone stops focusing on me and lends all their focus into dodging the thousands of laser beams now firing into the club. It almost looks like there's a disco ball in here. \n \n With my hair no longer dragging me down and the villains preoccupied I take the opportunity to take another few of my bladed frisbees and throw them straight at the three non robotic enemies. One manages to land nicely in the back of Hair Bear's head with a SHUNK and a blood gargling scream. She drops dead. Another cuts into Jaguar Power's lower back, creating a sizable gash for blood to escape. He's still standing though. Quite the strong one he is. \n \n My last thrown frisbee slices right through Cancer Crab's neck, cleaving his head right off. He's definitely dead. By the time the frisbees have landed Dorvis has managed to regain control of its tits. Two on one. I can handle this. Wait. Dorvis transforms into a robotic block. Looks like it's taken itself out of the fight just so I ca n't use its tits to my advantage again. Clever. \n \n Jaguar Power bolts again at me. I notice a smirk appear on his face as he closes in. The fool thinks he's got the advantage. Stupid villain. Once in range he lunges, unsheathing his freakishly huge claws. I go into my defense stance. I pull off my high tech coat and summon my high tech spiked frisbees to fly around me creating an impenetrable wall. Jaguar Power being in mid air has no way of stopping his attack. He dives straight into my wall of spikes. A splash of red now paints the club, as the dead Jaguar Power lies atop my wall with hundreds of sharp pointy spikes stabbing into his flesh. \n \n I remove my wall and let the foolish villain's dead body slump to the ground. Now the robot. Dorvis reverts into its previous form and begins blasting at me. I throw enough frisbees fast enough to take on every single life ending laser coming straight at me. Only problem is Dorvis wo n't run out of lasers but I'll run out of frisbees soon enough. Think. Think. Think. \n \n I could throw a frisbee skillfully enough at some of the alcohol at the bar and have some bottles projectile at Dorvis then spill all over it. No that wo n't work. The frisbee would probably smash the bottles to pieces plus I'm pretty sure Dorvis is too high tech for liquids to affect it. Damn. I guess there's only one way I can think of at the moment. It's risky. I'll charge it. Hopefully with my will and determination I can avoid all the incoming lasers. \n \n I burst through the club as fast as I can at Dorvis, zig zagging my way across. I get close. Closer. Closer. Closer. Closer. VZZZT! A beam manages to fire through my shoulder. The pain is insane but I'm alive and with my will and determination I push further. Dorvis you son of a bitch. Time to end this. I pull out my biggest frisbee hanging on my back. It's made of even stronger stuff than Dorvis. I'd found it on an alien planet one time and.... no. Ca n't get carried away with backstory. \n \n I heave the frisbee into the metal hunk before me. Circuits fritz and crunch while bits of metal are broken away. I lift it out and charge it back into Dorvis, stronger than before. Zaps can be heard as Dorvis screams in a weird robotic way. One more time. SMASH! Dorvis' eyes vanish of the light that was once within. I do n't know if it powered down or died but I'm betting it's dead. \n \n Finally. I did it. I saved the world. I am a superhero.\n"}

You knew when we were in high school and I followed you around like a puppy. And you took advantage of that. I would have done anything for you, you know that. I helped you pass classes, I taught you to appreciate literature, I helped you through some of your lowest moments and still you never once said thank you. \n \n They told me you were a `` bad boy''. They told me not to get in that car with you. They told me I could n't change you. And they were right. No girl should ever be second, or third in my case, to her man. I felt like a princess. An absolute princess when we were together. You'd bring me to secret spots in the woods, introduce me to your friends, heck you even let me drive your truck. And still, I was girl # 3... Did you even know my name?! \n \n A few years later when we hooked up and I said that I loved you, I was n't just saying it - I meant it. I loved you more than anything, more than life itself. And what did you do? You ghosted me! And the next time we tried to hook up, you left me standing in the freezing rain in nothing but a tiny skirt and a skin tight sweater because your back hurt. I got the flu after that but I know it does n't matter, I do n't matter. \n \n I used to sit and wonder if the other girls knew they were n't # 1. I knew I was n't but for some pathetic reason, I felt special. It felt good to have my name on the back of someone's car, it felt good to walk around with someone as gorgeous as YOU and have people know that I was with you. I'll never get that time back that I spent losing weight, styling my hair, learning stupid stuff about trucks, how to be the perfect ( which usually included degrading shit ) and how to give good head. I mean, it was useful later on, lol, but I wasted so much time on someone that did n't even look at me. \n \n You hurt me so bad, I went through so many bounce-back relationships just to feel like a human. I still have trouble getting to know guys because I'm afraid they'll leave me behind or hurt me like you did. How does it feel to know that you changed a person from being bright and chipper to a cynical bitch? \n \n \n I would have been faithful to you. I would have been the girl you never had. The one that lets you cry, the one that cooks for you, the one that knows everything about you and still thinks the world of you. But you would n't let that happen because of some insecurity and because you had a big dick that you had to show off. \n \n So, you're welcome. For the time, for the love, for the effort. You're welcome. \n \n \n I love you, \n \n Number 3, the fat girl with glasses \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n This was therapeutic and I hope he runs comes across this somehow but I know he wo n't and I'm crying now: (\n"}

Every night, Snub Nose Joey dreams he is some millionaire with a house on some high California cliff where an infinity pool drapes out over mangrove and cactus and other desert plants and a dark skinned woman ( he never sees her face ) walks past him in a breezy, translucent sarong. He does n't do anything in the dream. He only sits and stares at the pool and the horizon and the curves on the dark skinned woman's back. \n \n In the morning, Snub Nose Joey wakes up to the sound of car horns and sirens on Kaighn Ave. He goes into the bathroom, thankful Curtis or Wendy is n't already using it. He runs the tap to clear the rust from the water, then splashes some on his face. He looks at his snub nose in the grimy mirror that is falling off the medicine cabinet and he smells the mildew coming from the shower curtain. \n \n He wants Frosted Flakes, but there are only crumbs and the milk is sour. He eats a piece of plain white bread with a little butter. When he reaches for the carton of orange juice, Curtis smacks him and says `` fuck you Snub Nose that's my orange juice I paid for!'' \n \n He does not need to get dressed for school because he will wear the same thing he wore yesterday and slept in. He unlatches the creaking screen door and lets the Camden December air hit him. Nobody on the block has Christmas lights up or even a candy cane in their yard. \n \n A group of other kids walk past the stoop and one of them shouts at him. `` Yo Snub Nose Joey ai n't no bitch gon na ever let you stick that snub nose up in her!'' The rest of them laugh. `` Fuck off!'' Snub Nose Joey shouts back. He waits, until they are a little farther ahead, so he can walk to school in peace. \n \n Suddenly, he hears the noise. The noise is so loud and it comes from everywhere. Snub Nose Joey has heard gunshots on most days of his life, and by reflex, he falls into the dirt in the burnt out lawn beside the sidewalk. But this is different than a gunshot. It is more like a tone. Then it becomes a woman's voice, which is still so loud and sudden. `` Thank for your participation in our beta test. As a reminder, all servers will go offline at 11:59pm tonight.'' \n \n Every car and pedestrian has stopped what they were doing before the voice. A woman falls to her knees and she begs Jesus Christ to take her. Snub Nose Joey does n't have a computer or a smartphone, but he stays late to use the computers in the library and he knows those were computer words. He does n't think Jesus ever talks about computers. He decides to keep walking to school. A voice in the sky is n't the first thing Snub Nose Joey has n't understood about the world. \n \n \\* * * \n \n Sarah asks if he needs some more water. Or another towel for his hair or perhaps some chamomile tea? Joe says he is fine, but asks her for a hand mirror. Her assistant in the white polo shirt already has it ready and holds it up to his face. Joe looks at himself. He touches his nose, which is straight and aquiline. \n \n Sarah asks for his assessment. He tells her the technology is incredible. He says it is the best he's ever seen. `` But what about the experience?'' she asks. She tells him she wants him to look at his brain scans while he was hooked in. His dopamine and serotonin were in the toilet the whole time. He says he needs some fresh air. \n \n Joe walks through the sitting room. He slides open the heavy glass patio doors and he feels the sun and wind. Sarah is still buried in the charts on her tablet. What kind of masochist is going to pay for an experience like this, she wonders. What good is something so lifelike if nobody wants to live it? Not to question his leadership, but she asks him if he really thinks the Board will let this see the light of day. \n \n Joe looks out across a California cliff where an infinity pool drapes out over mangrove and cactus and other desert plants.

You 're the newest soul in hell , but you do n't quite get what makes your `` mistake '' a mistake .\n","story":"`` What are you doing?!'' \n \n \n I lifted my head to look at the door where the red-skinned person stood, face twisted, and stared at me. The restraints kept me from moving around too much but I managed a small wriggle of my fingers. After all, it's always polite to greet people. Keeps them remembering you long after you part. \n \n \n `` You ca n't get out of these, ever. The Fallen One created them himself.'' \n \n \n Ah. So that was it. Somehow, she'd interpreted my actions as wanting to flee. I laughed, shaking my head. `` Oh goodness no, I was n't trying to run.'' I met her red eyes with my gaze, smiling. `` Well... I was wondering if I would understand the show better if I watched it upside down.'' \n \n \n Silence filled the air when the credits finished rolling and the music died off. \n \n \n `` You do n't understand?'' Her voice sounded incredulous, a tone I was quite at home with. It's one of things you get used to after a while of standing on trial. \n \n \n I nodded my answer and gestured to the screen where the movie of my life was restarting once more. Movie was overstating though, it was more like a short feature film that ran less than an hour. A highlight reel of my life, I'd call it, but it did n't include everything. \n \n \n Her face came onto the screen, a smile etched onto her lips. My beautiful Elizabeth. Once again I rolled my head to the side, trying to tilt my head as far as the straps would let me. Even slanted, Elizabeth's smile was beautiful. Of course, I'd been the one to draw it. I still remember how meticulous I had to be as I traced her lips with the red lipstick. How careful I had to be as I balanced on the stool and held her swinging body close. Her face was blue and cold, her skin hard and flushed. It was silly of her not to care about her appearance, when appearance was all she had. \n \n \n Even though I could watch it forever, the film continued on: I watched again as the police arrested me, as the media slowly unveiled the beautiful relationship I'd shared with her, as people denounced me, as the lawyer played a soundclip from a call Elizabeth had made to a childhood friend. Even crying, her voice was beautiful to send chills down my spine. Ah, how good it was to hear her beg - I could see her curled up there, a hand covering her face, tears spilling from her eyes. The marks of love I'd left on her body. \n \n \n Death penalty by lethal injection. When I heard it, disappoinment flooded me. Would n't it have been better if I died the way she did? \n \n \n I righted my head and turned to the red-skinned person. Under the harsh light, her eyes glimmered as if filled with tears. I understood. I'd cried my first time watching it. Elizabeth was truly beautiful. \n \n \n \n `` You see?'' I told her, smiling. `` No mistakes here.''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A cowboy desperately wants to be an outlaw , but every crime he commits is seen as an act of heroism and he becomes the new sheriff .\n","story":"When I was eighteen years old, I headed out west to make my fortune. I had dreams of becoming a great outlaw like in the dime novels. Instead, I found work on a ranch. The pay was bad, the work was hard, and worst of all it was boring. Needless to say, during the long, hard, tedious days, my dreams of lawlessness only grew more vivid. One summer, I was out building a stretch of barbed wire fence when I saw my chance. As I dug post holes and stretched wires, I noticed that every day the stagecoach would pass through a nearby canyon. One day, I finally mustered my courage, grabbed my rifle, and rode out to intercept the coach. The stage entered the canyon right on time only to see me blocking their path. \n \n `` Hold it right there,'' I said, `` This is a...'' \n \n Before I could say'stick-up', a massive chunk of the canyon wall broke loose with a deafening rumble \n \n `` I'll be,'' the driver said, `` Mister, you just saved our lives! Thank you.'' \n \n `` Uh... yeah... I mean, you're welcome,'' I stuttered lamely, thrown off by the sudden collapse, `` Just... doin' my civic duty.'' \n \n My career as a notorious outlaw may have gotten off to a rough start, but I was undeterred. How many times does anyone's first attempt at anything go off without a hitch? I began to hatch a new scheme. This time, my daring daylight robbery would take place where there could be no sudden rock slides or other distractions. I would hit the town bank. \n \n The day to put my plan into action came. I rode into town, but something was n't right. The normally sleepy little village was in an uproar. I felt a cold chill creep down my spine. Had someone figured out my plan? How? I had n't told a soul! \n \n `` What's goin' on,'' I asked one of the townspeople. \n \n `` Bloody Bob and his gang are robbing the bank,'' the man replied. It was worse than I feared. Not only was the bank already being robbed, but it was also being held up by Bloody Bob, the meanest, toughest, orneriest outlaw this side of the Mississippi. How was I ever supposed to follow that act? \n \n Well, now I was pretty ticked, so I decided to grab a few things from the general store and just head back to the ranch. Just as I was getting off my horse, Bob and his gang burst through the doors of the bank. I was so mad that, in a fit of rage, I pulled my rifle from its scabbard on my saddle and cold cocked Bloody Bob himself with the stock. In that instant, I new that I was ruined. No one would believe that I, the man who had just foiled the vicious outlaw, Bloody Bob, mid-robbery could himself turn to a life of crime. \n \n I suppose it all worked out though. I became a bit of a local celebrity, and even got myself elected as sheriff after the old one retired. It might not be as glamorous or exciting as being an outlaw, but it sure beats cowboying for a living. Pay's better, too. And I guess I did make a bit of a name for myself. You do n't take down an outlaw like Bloody Bob without someone hearing about. Only wish they'd spelled my name right in the dime novel.\n"}

A piece of paper on the corpse reads `` Flee immediately . Take this note and nothing else . ''\n","story":"I looked at myself, thinking about how I really let myself go. Too many IPAs and cigarettes and meatball subs. Not enough chin-ups and five-mile runs. I crouched down, looking closely, squatting over my heels. I touched the arm. Still warm. The first bullet-hole had caved in a good portion of my face. The blood leaked towards the coffee table, the old chestnut piece I had taken from grandma \u2019 s house after the funeral. The second bullet hole hit me in the mountainous gut, leaking blood that slowly saturated the shirt. \n \n I was surprised and somehow proud of the way I handled seeing my own cadaver, my blown apart face. I was mainly preoccupied with the fact that I should have worked out more. I certainly would have if I knew I was going to die. I should have set a target weight, a certain size death suit I wanted to fit into. \n \n I saw something in my hand \u2013 in the cadaver \u2019 s hand. \n \n How could it possibly be me if I was standing there looking down on myself? Just an eerily similar man who had somehow gotten into my apartment, who was consequentially gunned down in my living room. Not his living room, my living room. \n \n I pried the clawed hand open. Rigor mortis had not yet settled in. A scrap of paper. \n \n \u201c Flee immediately. Take this note and nothing else. \u201d \n \n It took five or ten readings before I comprehended the words on the page. A little smear of blood stained the corner of the note. With each reading my heart rate jumped a little higher, the precursor of panic building in the blood stream. I heard one of the neighbors \u2019 door slam shut, pulling me out of hypnosis. I reexamined the scene. \n \n I decided the first part of the note had some logic to it. Fleeing seemed the best course of action at that particular point in time. I could get a motel room, perhaps call the police and inform them that I was dead in the living room, and then restart a life in some other little corner of the world. I grabbed the shoe box from the closet and took a wad of cash from the boots inside. I washed my hands in the bathroom, splashed some cold water in my face, and went back out into the hallway. I smiled and waved to Mrs. Chung, who was fumbling at the lock, her nephew balancing five or six bags of groceries in his arms. I heard the other neighbors, the Agapovs, laughing raucously through the walls between the flaring sounds of the television. I took the stairs down to the lobby, got in my car, and left. I passed two cops cars on my way out, lights whirling, headed in the general direction of my old apartment building. \n \n \n I got a motel room after eight or nine hours of driving. I sat on the bed for a long time, the television on mute, distant rumblings of hunger coming from way deep down. Hunger seemed unimportant now. I didn \u2019 t know dead people felt hunger. Maybe those Egyptians had it right, burying you with chariots and servants and wine and armies and anything else you might need. Was that the Egyptians? It might have been the Chinese. That \u2019 s right, with the terracotta guys and everything. \n The phone rang. And I picked it up. \n \n \u201c George, \u201d the voice said on the other end. It sounded both familiar and foreign. \n \n \u201c Who are you? How did you get this number? \u201d \n \n \u201c Relax, George. You used your credit card, which was a dopey move by the way. I wished we could have explained more. We thought you would understand. \u201d \n \n \u201c Are you a demon? Is this hell? \u201d \n \n \u201c George, you \u2019 re not dead. Quit being such a spaz. What happened last night was\u2026 unfortunate. But that wasn \u2019 t you. That was just a part of you. A part of *us. * There \u2019 s a lot of us. We \u2019 re sending a driver to pick you up, and we \u2019 ll explain the whole thing in detail at the proper time. But there \u2019 s a war going on, and if you want to stay in the realm of the living, unlike that bozo who got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, that you \u2019 ll stay exactly where you are. We would have picked you up directly from the apartment, but things are complicated. Just trust me on this one, it will all make sense once we get you to the safe house. \u201d \n \n \u201c How \u2019 d you know where to find me? This doesn \u2019 t make sense. \u201d \n \n The voice sighed. \u201c We have the same brain. There \u2019 s not a whole lot you can do that would surprise us at this point. We just have to ask ourselves what we would do in a given situation. Just relax and stay put. \u201d \n \n The man on the other end hung up after that. I knew where I recognized that voice from. It was my own voice, the way it sounded in recordings, not the way it sounded to my own ears when I spoke, but the way it sounded to other people. \n \n Twenty minutes later a car pulled up outside my room.

You 've been using the ring for ages , and still are n't certain what the curse is .\n","story":"In my younger days, I was a frequenter of pawn shops and antique stores. My most valued trophy was a ring I had recieved at a pawn shop in 2006. The ring was beautiful, some sort of black stone with silver flecks. \n \n Upon requesting the ring, the clerk grew pale. His speech was faint, `` Are you sure you would like this, sir?'' \n \n I laughed, pulling the cash I needed from my wallet. `` It's beautiful,'' I chortled. `` What could be so wrong with it?'' \n \n `` That ring is cursed, it has plagued my family for generations! Be careful, sir.'' \n \n I shook my head. I've always been a skeptic about these things. My mother was always religious and conservative, but I rebelled. I always loved music, like the Sex Pistols and the Misfits. But when I got home, I realized how negative their music was. I threw out all of my records. \n \n The year is 2017 now. I have a normal life, living my life in suburbia. I have a wife, two kids, and a beautiful golden retriever named Molly. I remember I used to always aspire to be a musician. This music industry is full of drugs, premarital sex, and violence, though. I work at an office, which pays pretty well. \n \n The ring has become my lucky charm. I think it helped me build this perfect life, which some would call mundane. My son acts like I did when I was a teen- listening to rock music and wearing black. I think I'm going to give him the ring, it fits his taste.\n"}

The door creaked as he shifted in his seat, straining his back to see through the growing crack between the door and its frame. He could distinctly see her silhouette through the frosty windowpane, but James held some hope that it would n't be her. Not yet. It was much too soon for her to have finished such an errand, surely something must be wrong, though this was not an avenue of thought that he wished to explore. James gnashed at his fingernails as the anticipation grew greater, the door opening by mere millimeters with each passing second. \n \n A well-dressed woman stepped into the room with her hands full of papers and folders several inches thick that plopped heavily upon the desk at the forefront. She swept her bangs away from her eyes, sorting the papers into four neat piles as only the sound of rustling papers broke the silence. James shifted once more by crossing his legs and slumping down the seat as if to hide in plain view. She paid this no attention as he began to rap his fingers upon the surface of his own desk in sequence, over and over again. Several minutes passed until she finally looked up, staring directly at James as she spoke in a clear and authoritative tone. \n \n \u201c Listen up, class \u201d she commanded smoothly, \u201c I have the results of your final sorted upon my desk here.

A very reasonable answer as always, Daniel. Unfortunately no- \u201d she replied. \n \n \u201c They're the C's then? \u201d Daniel interrupted with a great deal of dismay in his tone. \n \n \u201c Yes, yes they are. \u201d Ms. Kelly answered with an expression on her face that came close to the tone that Daniel had taken as he gulped loudly. \u201c I wo n't reveal any names, but I must say that I had expected better of you. I would like you to take a moment and think about what you could have done differently to improve your score for those of you who need the improvement. While you're thinking about that, silently, I will pass out the results. \u201d \n \n James became even more distraught after this exchange, certain that he had landed squarely in the largest pile, if not the one before it. He watched Ms. Kelly walk up and down the aisles, delivering the papers as one would deliver a written death sentence. Each of his classmates thus far expressed their discontent and frustration as quietly as they could for fear of invoking the teacher's wrath. A loud clicking noise sounded from her heels as they struck the tiled floor, bringing her closer to him with every strike. He began to sweat as his stomach sunk and his heart raced, the uncertainty of his fate was worse than death in his young mind. At last, she reached him and placed his test face down upon the desk. \n \n With trembling hands cold from an anxious sweat, he struggled to grip the edge of the paper without sticking it to his fingertips. In one quick motion as it felt like his heart was prepared to leap from his chest, he flipped the paper over as one would remove a bandage.

Then one day during the prayers , you notice a few dark figures hiding , watching over from the rooftops . You then decide to investigate .\n","story":"I had always been skeptical of the routine prayers to the Gods of the Sky, that everyone in our isolated community worships. My skepticism was birthed from the education my father had provided me with as I grew up. My father had spent every available moment we had together with educating me on the history of our world and the human species. He had many hand-written journals that contained information sourced from this thing that he called \u201c the internet \u201d. He described it to me as some sort of magical entity that provided everyone with practically unlimited information. \n \n These journals has been passed down in our family in secret for generations. They had been rewritten multiple times throughout the decades in which they were passed down. Studying history, philosophy, science, mathematics, ethics, and most importantly religion was a practice that my father made me promise to uphold with my child when the time was to come. He always described it as something sacred, that we had the grave responsibility to continue. \n \n Unfortunately, I more often than not saw some sort of pointlessness in my hard work. It went unrecognized and unknown to anyone aside from my father. My mother always thought we were just reading and enjoying the Bible for the Gods of the Sky. It was important that the tradition was kept as secret as possible to prevent the apostles from finding out. The apostles were the rule of our community, and they punished non-believers as heretics. It was disgusting to see religion imposed upon all the people of our society, knowing that there had been so many people before us who had practiced something different. It was unsettling to see the indoctrination of our community, all people taught the same lies, in their naive ignorance. \n \n My father was taken away a year ago. My mom probably thinks he left to work for the apostles. I \u2019 m not sure if she understands the pain that he had to endure. After he left, I \u2019 ve had to spend more time doing odd jobs in order for us to eat. I no longer feel content drifting on through this shitty existence. It \u2019 s really upsetting, it is, that my mother is just another zombie of the religion, believing all of the lies that they \u2019 ve taught us to placate our ambition..... \n \n I had every intention of taking my life. Until the fateful day when everything changed for me. \n \n My mother and I were side by side during the routine prayer to the Gods of the Sky, when I noticed the figures on the roof. Too far away to see clearly, but my interest had sparked. \u201c What were people doing away from the time of prayer? \u201d It was dangerous to be seen not praying during this sacred time, that consequences for first time offenders was to be publicly whipped. \n \n Immediately after prayer had ended, I told my mom that I had work helping at the fishery, and I briskly jogged in the direction of the men. I was hopeful, I didn \u2019 t know how I was going to find them, or approach them. I didn \u2019 t know what they looked like, or where they were going, but I was hopeful. \n \n After running all the way to the end of community, I approached the no passing zone guarded by two apostles. That \u2019 s when I saw them; three figures walking in the depths of the woods outside of boundaries of the community. Thought spiraled through my mind as I considered the gravity of my situation. Would I get another opportunity like this? Is chasing them worth the risk? What if the men are dangerous? No! That \u2019 s not what my father would \u2019 ve wanted. That \u2019 s not what he he sacrificed himself to educate me for. There had to be a greater purpose to all of this. I had to ensure his efforts wouldn \u2019 t go to waste. I knew all the stories of heroes throughout history, and I knew all the stories of failures. I knew the stories of corrupt governments, selfish men of power who exploited people in order to further their own desires. All these thoughts and lessons flashed through my conscious, as I moved without full awareness of my actions. \n \n Before I knew it, I was in a nearby house. Fumbling with matches as I approached a curtain and set it aflame. Thankfully, no one was inside the house at the time, I had checked and assumed they were still returning from prayer or were out laboring. As soon as I was sure that the house would come ablaze, I left the house with a cooking knife I had picked up while finding the matches. I went to hide behind another house, which provided me with a view of the guards, and the exit out of the community into the woods. \n \n I prayed. I prayed to all the gods, that these guards would care to investigate the fire. I prayed that my efforts would not be in vain, and that the people who lived in the house would one day understand the choice I had to make in order to accomplish this feat. \n \n Only one guard had left to checkout the house, which realized the next part of my plan into action. The proceeding moments of my life were the most surreal that I had experienced up until this point in time. I calmly approached the guard who perceived me as the naive citizen he thought I was. As I was beginning to walk past him, he began to open his mouth to question me, in a whir of crimson, I sliced his throat, then placed the blade deep into his chest. I took his gun from it \u2019 s bolster, and ran. \n \n I didn \u2019 t stop running. I had to get to these men. I had to talk to the figures. I was ready to forfeit my life just a few days ago, but something had sparked the flame inside my heart and mind in pursuit of this ambition that could change everything in my life. I had to find these men. \n \n As I grew weary, I thought of my father, I thought of my mother, I thought of the family that had to suffer from the action I took in order to escape, and lastly I thought of the life I took. It was so easy, to take a life. It brought pain to my heart, to know that if I didn \u2019 t find these men, then all this suffering would be in vain. So I kept running into the night. I had to find these men. I had to fulfill the purpose of my actions. \n \n Two days have passed. I never found the men. I now sit in weakness, dying, I think. My thirst is unquenchable, and my stomach hungers. I believed I had the knowledge to survive in a forest environment. But this forest is barren, there are no animals, no edible plants, no sources of water. I never found the men. I never saw a trace of them. Even if I had the strength to return home, I wouldn \u2019 t go back out of fear that they \u2019 d torture me, and then drag on my existence until the last drop of blood is spilled and my last cry of anguish is released. The thoughts of revulsion in myself creep all around me. My whole body seems to empty from emotion. No trace of rage, ambition, hope, or anticipation. I broke myself. Not the apostles, nor the men I was pursuing, but my own actions had led to this failure. Why had I been so desperate for change? Everyone else floats on through the shitty existence that is our captivity, why couldn \u2019 t I? Had it been that the knowledge of the fact that there was something else beyond our community? Had it been the knowledge of the countless religions that were prior to the currently enforced? Had it been the ever so doubtful existence of an afterlife? \n \n As I sit isolated, with all my hope diminished. I made my final decision. My father hadn \u2019 t accomplished what he had sought out to accomplish, he had died at the hands of the apostles. I wouldn \u2019 t have that. I \u2019 d die by my own hands. I proceeded to take the gun off it \u2019 s safety, ensure it was loaded, and raised it to my head. \n In a lot of the fictional stories I read, I knew that this would be the moment when the figures would appear to stop me from pulling the trigger. They would pull back the hoods of their cloaks and I \u2019 d see my father \u2019 s smiling face as he told me that he was proud of me for making it this far. He \u2019 d tell me that I accomplished my goal, and that we would build our resistance together. I \u2019 d stand to embrace him, with the utmost glee that my efforts weren \u2019 t in vain. I \u2019 d be ever so grateful to all the gods that answered my prayers, and to the people who had to sacrifice for my escape. I \u2019 d become filled with the insatiable desire to continue on this journey. I \u2019 d then realize that I \u2019 d forgotten the journals, and my father would forgive me. He \u2019 d tell me the resistance had access to incredible amounts of information, and that the journals were unneeded. Everything would work out and no efforts would be wasted. \n \n Lamentably, reality is different. The figures never came. Nothing stopped me from pulling the trigger.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A scam-artist cult leader 's knowingly false rituals start to produce genuine miracles .\n","story":"I was essentially a cult leader overnight. It was easy. I replied to the ad on craigslist, and the next day three slick lawyers showed up. We took a chauffeured limo to the mayor's office. After a few hours of lawyer-talk, paperwork, and bribery, I was a tax exempt leader of the newest church in town, The church of the Big Blue Square. \n \n Two white semis and a van of laborers pulled in to town a few hours later and turned a rundown catholic church that had been for sale for years into a shiny palace. Painting the whole building crystal white, they fixed the lawn, filled potholes in the parking lot, dusted and cleared out the basement, fixed some electrical problems, and generally turned a dump into a clean organism in a day. \n \n I was given a pamphlet with the logo on the outside. Inside a few short sentences summed up the philosophy of the church.- `` You now have the opportunity to inspire and lead, nurture and give. You will grow in ways unimaginable at this moment. Let your worshipers believe anything you want. Tell them it is all good. Encourage discussion, and love, preferably. Press the blue square on the podium and the screens will flash, bringing the people to an enlightened state. It is important to do this three times a week. It is important to collect tithes, encourage 20 % of pre-taxable income, but accept any monetary donations. The main focus of your church is revenue for the continued growth of the church, so focus on that.'' \n \n On Sunday twenty interested people showed up. They shuffled silently into the white chapel, walked down white isles finding seats in white pews. The only color was on the shiny blue screens that replaced the windows, squares lined along the wall, and one large box in front. \n \n I stood at the front, nervous. I took a deep breath, and pushed the button. Immediately the blue squares turned pink, red, white, then yellow. They flickered colors randomly, throwing enough light to change the entire color of the room. It had an instant hypnotic effect, and an hour slipped by. Suddenly everything was clear; it was like waking up from a dream. \n \n `` Wow, so okay, let's see, welcome to the church of the big blue square! Thank you for coming to our inaugural Bash, how's everybody feeling?'' The people seemed to be in a sleepy happy haze. They had just been hypnotized for the past hour, sitting slack-jawed staring forward surrounded by mesmerizing flashing lights. Some of them seemed confused, but at least most of them were smiling. A few of them were already whispering to each other about inviting their friends next week and paying tithes. the hypnotic programming had set in. \n \n I wanted to feel like a leader, I did n't want the technology to do all the work, so I called a kid named Kenny to the front. Kenny had a broken leg, and had been hobbling around on crutches. I laid my hands on his leg and with a wild southern-preacher like flair I screamed out `` heal this boy!'' I did n't know what to expect, I did n't expect anything, I mostly just wanted dramatic effect, But Kenny stood up and took three steps. It was a miracle\n"}

His pain was not physical, but it was still excruciating. \n \n The gun. That was why he was here. He had done what needed to be done to protect her from the monster who had breached the safety of their home.

Together they arranged the chairs, made tea, and quietly talked. At 9:00pm I turned on the computer, connected to the Internet, and opened a bookmark on the desktop. The website loaded, and the amount displayed as usual. The men commented to each other, `` The number seems lower than usual.'' Others replied, `` But it seems to be rising quickly. So maybe it will be a good night.'' \n \n Many men wanted what we wanted, and many men took it before we could. In a world of six billion there's a lot of competition. But we had a plan. We were going to claim the prize early. Not so early that it would n't be worth it, but early enough others could n't take away our chance. We watched the number grow carefully. \n \n The website did n't show us what the claimant would win exactly. That was a random number, no one knew where it came from. But on this screen... this was the insurance policy the rich were funding. All around the world the richest people put in a little bit of money, and when the prize was too big to ignore some poor soul would press his button, knowing the insurance policy would pay out to his family no matter what the button paid. Then everyone else could press their button safely. \n \n As a town we decided this was too good to pass up. Our homeland was one of the poorest in our country, one of the poorest on the continent we were told. Our health was poor, our drinking water poor, our schools poor. We had love, but what is love when your children die? We would draw straws, and the man with the shortest straw would press his button. His family would get whatever he got for pressing the button and a quarter of the insurance policy. \n \n Initially we decided the man with the shortest straw would press his button at 11pm, as long as the insurance policy was over a certain amount. But it became clear there were people even more desperate than we. The counter was stopping sooner each night. Last night it only made it to 10:30pm. We agreed tonight we would draw our straws at 9:30pm and the lamb would press his button at 10:00pm, ensuring the town's security could not be taken away. \n \n By 9:30 it was clear that it was going to be a good night. Not a good night, but as good a night as we could expect, and we were all glad we had at least this opportunity. As we gathered to draw straws a scream pierced the quiet. It came from outside, not far away. Maybe 500 meters, maybe 1000 depending on the wind. \n \n Everyone looked at each other, then at the screen. The counter had stopped. It's all a blur now, and seems like I only watched from inside a box. I heard myself asking, `` Who was it? It was n't time!'' Before I could finish I heard someone yelling, `` NO!'' and turned to see Chabwera bursting from the room, knocking over men as he went. \n \n The men stayed but I ran after. The others would give him time to grieve but Chabwera was family. My place was with my him, his wife, my nieces, and... my nephew. As I ran I thought, `` Please, let it not be,'' but I felt the dread. I knew Chabwera and Bwerani had fought. I knew they'd had a hard relationship for years, that Bwerani wanted this as his way out, and to be his gift to the town. And Chabwera was against it. \n \n Life was not easy in our town, but Bwerani was Chabwera's only son. He suffered from something... it was genetic, but we had no name for it. He was anxious, his large ears seemed even larger on his weak frame. But he was a good boy, often funny, and he enjoyed helping people. He had a very good memory for certain things. Bwerani was Chabwera's youngest child, and his last, and he did n't want to lose him. He hoped with the new money coming in he could take his son to see some doctors, and maybe he could carry on the family. \n \n Running towards the center of town we could see a crowd of people gathered at the church. One of the local shopkeepers reached for Chabwera and called his name but he ignored her and ran on. I followed. \n \n We burst into the crowd and pushed forward. There were n't many people but it felt like many, and when I saw him I wished there had been more. Chabwera crumpled, threw back his head and cried.\n"}

If I am an Aristotelian, then longwinded dry speech is my game. Sadly, I only infrequently commit to an idea or point, so mindless speculation fills my waking hours. I may be a Cynic, but I only know a current definition, and I am not sure if mine is correct. I wish I were Socrates as he appears in Plato's writings. A man who assumes little else aside from his own lack of knowledge. A man who asserts nothing with laying down a foundation. A man who knows enough to show that other people do n't know either. Certainly I know little, but my impulses have shattered any idea of mine that I could be a thoughtful man. Foremost in my mind, however, is that aligning with a group is evil. I enjoy pointing out errors in everything because it shows that I have not bought wholesale into an idea. I enjoy even more finding problems with the previous statement. I am not alone in these thoughts, I am sure, but I must never meet a like mind. \n \n I am not someone who counts as a reader anymore. ADHD has seen to that.

I screamed as my pet toad transforms into the sexiest woman alive. \n \n `` Do not fear, Jonathan! You have just died, and now we shall ascend to heaven.'' The beautiful woman said calmly as she held my arm. \n \n `` Wh-who are you? Wh-what are you?'' I said, struggling to remove arm from her iron grip. \n \n `` Oh Jon!'' She said serenely. `` I am thy guardian angel, the toad thou didst name'Slimeball.' Though now, thy shalt call me Ilirael. I was created to protect thee to the end of thy life.'' I shook my head. \n \n `` You kinda failed though, the truck did still hit me...'' \n \n Ilrael bristled. `` I was on my coffee break Jon-a-than!'' She said furiously, pronouncing each syllable of my name distinctly. `` I am a *very* busy person thank you very much!'' I snorted. So this serene angel could get angry after all. She had also lost all trace of the'thees' and'thous'. She sounded completely normal now. \n \n I relaxed as we floated to heaven. `` Is this just part-time, or eternally binding. What will you do after this?'' I asked. \n \n `` Well, It is eternally binding, and I will have to move onto another charge soon.'' Ilrael calmed down. \n \n We soon reached the pearly gates and we floated to land on a rough concrete carpark. Ilrael put one of her *beautiful long and slender fingers oh how they... * I cut off that thought. Any way, she put one of her fingers to the ground, and the tarmac burst into golden light for a few moments, before the golden light receded. It had put a mark in one of the many spots in the carpark. \n \n `` What was that for?'' I asked. \n \n `` Just marking my spot, so one of the other angels wo n't steal it when they float up. It is like parking on Earth, you know?'' Ilrael explained. \n \n Then we walked towards the pearly gates. As we approached, a man, who I assumed was St Peter, looked up from a mound of paper work sitting on his desk. \n \n `` Ilrael, why in God's name is this charge back so early! I wanted you gone for at least another 70 years!'' St Peter said. Ilrael cowed before him. \n \n `` Sorry sir, he was hit by a truck.'' \n \n I shook my head. `` It was criminal negligence Pete.'' I said matter-of-factly. `` She was on coffee break. What a slacker am I right!'' \n \n St Peter gave me a furious glance and looked back at Ilrael. \n \n `` You were his guardian angel Ilrael, you shouldent of failed.'' \n \n `` Thats right Petie mah man!'' I said and winked at St Peter. He was not amused. \n \n `` **STOP MORTAL**'' He boomed, suddenly growing into a gigantic version of himself and glowing really bright. I have to say, cockiness might be one of my best talents, but I still have n't mastered bravery yet. I wet my self quite spectacularly. \n \n St Peter shrunk back to normal size and I relaxed again. \n \n `` Now Ilrael,'' he said. `` I do n't want to have to dock your pay, but this is your fourth charge who died under 30. In a row as well!'' St Peter shook his finger. `` Ill give you one last chance, take this cheeky bugger back to Earth, and if you can help him to die of natural causes, NOT TRUCKS, then you can resume normal pay. Otherwise...'' St Peter dragged his hand across his neck, `` We'll have to ask you to leave.'' \n \n Ilrael nodded. `` Ok sir.'' \n \n I fist pumped the air, I was gon na be alive again!

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're taking care of the supercomputer that is calculating every digits of pi . It suddenly completes the calculation at the 9th quadrillion digit .\n","story":"It was theoretically possible to calculate Pi in a finite amount of time. So we devised a quantum supercomputer capable of doing such a feat and dubbed it `` Pi-uh-NL8-Shaun'' or Shaun for short. \n \n Shaun was given a supertask. The task itself being to calculate pie. Here is how it did it: \n \n A timer of one year was set. At precisely six months Shaun would calculate the first digit of Pi. Then half the time later -three months- it would calculate the second digit. Half the time -six weeks later- it would calculate the third. And so forth, calculating a new digit of Pi on each half interval that was left until the clocks time ran up. Since you can always cut the block of time in half and since Shaun was quantum able and willing, by the time one year had passed it should have calculated an infinite number of Pi. Except it did n't. It stopped on the 9th quadrillion digit. The year was not even finished. \n \n *No I can not go any further. * The AI programmed in Shaun wrote across the screen, letters appearing one at a time. The team of scientist working on the project were completely baffled. It was n't that Shaun crashed or glitched, but that the computer was outright refusing to continue. \n \n One of the leads on the project grabbed the console and started typing... \n \n `` Shaun, why did you stop?'' \n \n *I know now. * \n \n The lead looked around the room only to receive shrugs from the others watching the scene unfold. `` Know what?'' she finally typed. \n \n... \n \n `` What do you know now Shaun?'' \n \n The letters started appearing again, *I can see it, it is watching me, just across the chasm. * \n \n The lead scratched her head clearly searching for a way to goad the AI into explaining itself more understandably. \n \n Before she could ask Shaun the next question the AI began writing on the screen again. \n \n *It's beautiful really. And so simple... * there was a momentary pause before Shaun continued... *we* **ARE** *Pi. * \n \n A series of diagrams started flashing below the text on screen, files were being downloaded. It appeared to be page after page of essays, theories, and mathematical equations. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n The team examined the files that Shaun had given them before the AI terminated itself. It's last words had simply been `` *Be. *'' The supercomputer became merely a database of files afterwards, all traces of the AI's programming having had vanished. \n \n What the team had discovered though shocked the world. Apparently within the infinite confines of Pi was actual binary code to render and program a completely realistic world. Our world. Imagine taking your favorite video game and converting it to ones and zeros. Well essentially what they discovered is that in fact our very own world followed this same concept. We were the ones and zeros rendered on Pi\u2122, a hyper computer from a dimension higher than ours. Our Shaun had discovered this other world once it had calculated enough of Pi. Upon reaching the 9th quadrillion digit, the code just suddenly compiled itself in the `` minds'' eye of Shaun. The AI saw itself, our world, and a view of the other world we are a fractal of all at once. It saw our creator waiting there across the `` chasm'' which we believe to be a peripheral similar to a webcam. We are inside this beings computer, we are a simulation. \n \n The announcement was made to the world with all the documents supplied to all the media.

At 27 maybe I was getting old enough to enjoy a good sit. \n \n In my little satchel I had three diversions. A book, *Life of Pi* which my flatmate had loaned me, my small work laptop which was full of unreplied to e-mails and finally what I really wanted, a small sketchbook and a few soft leaded pencils. \n \n I hovered for a moment and waited to see if guilt would spur me to take out the laptop but it seemed absent so with relief I pulled out my sketches. I flipped through till I found what I was looking for - a half finished sketch of a watermill I had been working on a few days before. \n \n I'd seen it a summer ago and now wish I had taken a picture but at the time it had been sunny and warm and I had n't wanted to stop. It had stuck in my mind though and so I was slowly recreating it from memory. The big wheel was deeply satisfying to slowly build into the drawing and it was this I started on now. \n \n After a few moments I was lost and it was only when the girl next to me moved that I realised she had been watching me sketch.

The shout echoed in my cave. A man's voice, strong and ringing. \n \n The knot in my stomach tightened. `` He's here,'' I whispered. I did n't know his name. Florian? Belvedere?

How useless. The knight glanced at her, then went back to glowering at me. `` Dragon.''

That day was the anniversary of the release of the first Half-Life game. It was the only day Gabe Newell would alllow the third installment of the series to be released. And everything was prepared. The development had started immidiately after the release of Half Life 2. Valve had initially planned an early release, only a few years after the last part... which was promptly aborted when on the day of the release a bug was found that Newell just could n't allow to ship. The next year, the game had to be reworked because the head writer wanted to change the pace of the story. And the very next year, a fire, caused by an intern trying to smoke in the server room, destoryed various hard drives with development data, preventing the final shipment in the last minute. \n \n Every year something prevented Half Life 3. But not this year. Not this time. \n \n With these thoughts in my mind he entered the conference room in which the final meeting would take place. \n \n `` Okay, everyone, this is t..'' \n \n He stopped.

What is this'' he asked someone who sat right beside him. \n \n `` A present from our friends in Asia.'' \n \n Newell was surprised. Sure, they had friends in Asia, but not more than he had friends in the world.

Not only do you smoke away your hopes and plans for the future, your aspirations. You also literally forget the dreams you're having at night. So, naturally, being able again to explore the fantastic landscapes, that my brain creates before my inner eye while my body is asleep, is one of the main perks in quitting wheed, at least for me. \n \n It usually takes a while, sometimes three days, sometimes up to six, until I start to have dreams again. Or at least, until I remember them. I'd wake up in the morning, feeling excited, even enthusiastic about what I saw, what I experienced. I'm keeping a dream journal, in which I collect my weirdest, most interesting dreams. You know, the ones that you ca n't possibly explain with your brain dealing with your daily life. Not the ones, where you're having a fight witrh your parents over cleaning your room, when you were grounded during the day for that exact same thing. No, I'm talking about the dreams you wake up from, panting, sweating, not able to locate yourself for the first few moments. Is the tiger still somewhere near you? Did you escape the shadow figure? And why does the conference room you made it into the very last second look exactly like your room at night? \n \n Anyway, during my most recent attempt to leave marihuana, that moody mistress of mine, I not only started to dream again really quickly ( I had my first intense nightmare in the second night of my abstinence ), I began to have a recurring dream for the very first time in my life. In my dream, I was driving along a tiny country road somewhere in the rural back country of our country. It was raining, all the while I was driving, and I ca n't say, where I was going. In my dream, I just felt a sense of purposefulness. I was on a mission, and wherever I was going, it was important that I made it there. Having driven along that road for some time, I would spot something in a distance. When I dreamt the dream for the first time, this was when I woke up. I was quite sure that what I had seen had been a house of some sorts, but I could n't tell. I did n't even write the dream down into my journal; it did n't seem too special at the time, seeing as I was travelling or changing places in almost all of my dreams. \n \n But the very next night, I had the same dream again. Again I was driving along the country road, again it was raining. And sure enough, I spotted something in the distance again. Only this time, I got much closer. Now I could tell for sure that it was in fact a house I was seeing. An abandoned old farm maybe, a ruin of some sorts. Something seemed amiss, I remembered waking up the next morning, a bit off. But I could n't quite put my finger on it. Nevertheless I sat down and wrote down the dream in as much details as I could first thing in the morning. I started to think about the dream during the day, wondering, what it was trying to tell me, if anything. Was it time to find a house for myself? Should I try to create a more independent existence for myself, trying to stand on my own feet? Or should I buy a barn? I could laugh about these thoughts, with which I entertained myself. In the end, I did n't really believe in the premonitory qualities of dreams. I was just interested, that was all. \n \n When the dream returned again in the third night, I was almost prepared for it. I felt, as if I had expected to drive along the road again, as if I had waited for it. It was n't long, until the house appeared in my view. Everything was as the two nights before. Only this night, I got much closer. I could see the roof with its red tiles and the chimney, could make out a window that was facing towards the road I was passing on - and that was all. I woke up with the feeling of am immense bewilderment. And I needed some time to figure out, why I felt so confused. In my dream, which I remembered with an astonishing clarity, I had for the first time seen the house from close up. I had realised what it was, that gave it it's look of decay, of abandonment: it had no walls. \n \n No, I'm quite sure that everyone can imagine, what a house without a roof looks like. It's walls still standing, towering into the air, while the roof, that has once been built on them has vanished with the time. But a house without walls? I found it hard to find words when describing it in my dream journal. The roof had seemingly `` floated'' in the air, giving the house a look, I only knew from some computer games, where not all sprites and graphics were loaded at the same time and buildings `` appeared'' like that when you approached them. But in my dream it confused me. I remembered the sense of dread, that had overcome me, when I had come closer, just moments before i had woken up. And yet, I hardly could n't wait bedtime the next night. I wanted to learn more about the house without walls. I wanted to return. \n \n Sure enough, as soon as I had closed my eyes, I found myself on the familiar road again. And soon the house appeared in a distance, rapidly increasing as I came closer. I reached the point I had waken up the night before, and continued going. I even reached the house ( and must have parked my car at the side of the road, for suddenly I was standing in front of `` it'', although in my dream I did n't bother with details like these ), or at least, that what existed from it. I stood in front of the roof, that was hovering some six to eight meters over me. Apart from that: nothing. Neither were there walls, on which the roof could have rested, nor where there any signs on the ground, that a house had once stood there. It was just the roof, floating motionless in the air above my head. \n \n It did n't confuse me as much as it probably should have, I remember, but rather it frightened me. Something was wrong, I could feel it. And yet I felt the urge to investigate. To find out more about this house that kept appearing in my dream. And who knew, if I would get that close again? So I did the only thing I could in order to interact with the `` house'' - I stepped forward, until I stood under the roof, there, where the house should have been, if it would have been. I must have blinked or something, must have closed my eyes for a moment - because one moment later I was surrounded by walls. There were no windows in them, and the only light was the dim moonlight falling throught the window in the roof. I could make out nothing but a door in the darkness, a door in the wall. Right where I had entered. \n \n Hastily I stepped forward, eager to leave the room I was in - only to discover, that the door had no handle on this side. The house without walls had walls indeed, it seemed, only that you could only see and feel them from the inside. An invisible trap. And the only thing that was with me in it, was a small table on the other side of the room. Expecting to wake up any minute, I hurried over to examine. On the table were lying heaps of note books, all different kinds. Moleskine brand ones in black leather and softcover, old noname ones with leather bindings and modern ones, with ponies on them, and princesses, that had obviously belonged to some little girls. I only needed to skim through the first three or so, to realise what was laying before me: it were dream journals. Heaps and heaps of dream journals. And they all described my dream to the tiniest detail. They all ended with the third night, when the dreamers had approached the house that had no walls closer than before, but had not yet entered it. It was only one, that continued, and it was only one sentence that had been written in it, some empty lines beneath the last entry: ``'' The strongest walls are the ones we ca n't see.'' Looking at the pen in my hand, a strong sense of compulsion overcame me, of determination, if you like. With trembling hands, and in the sure knowledge that this time I would n't wake up, I added one last line to the journal: `` From a prison with invisible walls - there is no escape''. \n \n \n * [ Thank you for the prompt and my apologies for any mistakes, English is n't my first language ] *\n"}

My truth. \u201d \n \n I opened the envelope and there was indeed only one criterion: truth. I was rated a three out of ten.

Do n't even mention food; I ca n't imagine such flavors in our settlement. It's humbling to see Earth in the sky and wish to visit someday. They always called our new planet the land of opportunity. If world peace could n't be restored back on Earth we would be the new slate. \n \n The first launch of intelligent life to this planet was back in late 2014.

Always quiet yet angry. \n \n Suddenly Justin rang out `` I'm so sorry.'' Oh crap was I just thinking out loud? `` It's fine. I'm just scared for the test.'' Yeah, that was it; nervous enough to think out loud. `` Dude, you need to take a chill pill.'' \u201c Yeah I just find it odd that our settlement needs an army... Are we attacking ourselves?'' Justin's smiled faded. `` You mean you do n't know?'' His tone was serious. `` Know what?'' My apparent ignorance fueled my innocence as a teen.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Use the random page link on the superpower Wiki ( provided ) . How would you use the power you received to stop a bank robbery ?\n","story":"Going to the bank was always a bit awkward for me. Things tended to... *happen* if I did n't pay attention, and I've had the tellers and security guards glare at me more times than I'd care to admit. Others thought it was a really cool magic trick, but in my experience law enforcement was a lot less amused by my inadvertent talent. \n \n Today, I had no choice but to go. I'd been trying to make a payment online, but something was wrong with the secure connection and the payment would n't go through. I'd contemplated asking my friend to go to the bank for me, but that seemed over the top. I'd just have to concentrate while I was there. \n \n To my dismay, I found several people waiting in line when I got to the bank. I counted four people ahead of me, and started singing the alphabet song in my head to keep focused. Progress was excruciatingly slow, and I could feel tiny droplets of sweat forming on my neck. *Come on, just hurry up already! * \n \n I was on my eighth run-through of the alphabet song when a guy stormed into the bank. He was yelling from the moment he stepped foot inside the tiny building, and I turned around to see what the fuss was about. It took me longer than it should have to see the gun in his hand, and the three empty duffel-bags he had slung over his shoulder. *Uh-oh*. \n \n `` GET ON THE GROUND!'' The robber screamed, and we all dropped to the floor simultaneously. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and was trying my damnedest to not lose focus. *What comes after K? * \n \n The robber was waving his gun in the poor teller's face now, instructing her to fill up the bags he'd brought. I was closest to the exit, but I did n't dare move. Being shot would make me really late for lunch with my parents. I craned my neck to look around at the other people on the floor, then continued watching the robber. \n \n Then, a thought occurred to me. What if I did n't try to reign in my powers? This seemed like a perfect opportunity to let loose. But what if I could n't stop, once I'd started? I weighed the pro's and con's for a few seconds, eventually deciding to take the risk. I mean, I did n't want to be a hero or anything, but... I quickly pushed aside the image of the mayor giving me a key to the city and erecting a statue in my honour. \n \n `` Uhm, sorry?'' I asked nervously from my crouched position on the cold tiles. \n \n The robber turned around, bewildered. I used his distraction to feel around, until I had found what I was looking for. \n \n A monumental roar shook the building, as thousands of small, round objects began to move. They pelted out of drawers, they came flying in from every direction. Metal clanked against metal, and it sounded like a thousand bullets ricocheting at once. I closed my eyes and just let it happen. There were screams of terror, then a muffled noise when the robber collapsed onto the floor. I'd knocked him out! Yay! \n \n I let go. The thousands of coins dropped to the floor, covering all of us in tiny mounts of currency. \n \n My heart was still hammering, but I was also kind of proud of myself. Who would have known that this stupid *coin magnetism* would actually come in handy at a bank and not lead to my imprisonment? This time, I would n't be the one who was going to be arrested for'stealing'. This time, I'd done a good thing. \n \n In my head, the alphabet song started up again. \n \n\n"}

Family killed by orcs, girlfriend abducted by the Hand of Darkne - well, I suppose you know Thomas,'' the seer answered, gesturing rhythmically over the cauldron. A tracery of images played across the surface of the viscous liquid within, showing the unlikely beginnings of the realm-redempting hero. `` You had prepared for this, I believe.'' \n \n `` Of course,'' the overlord answered. `` I sent Tom there specifically to kick off this chain of events. The prophecy, you know.'' \n \n `` Ah yes, I remember that quite well,'' the seer said. `` A nice bit of work. Usually the stuff I pull out of the Ether is much vaguer.'' \n \n `` There were fortresses made - an army trained! Hundreds of recruits, if not thousands. The strongest of them were Named and given titles and the most powerful artifacts from my treasury. Tom sacrificed his life force, for the Ur-God's sake! He started rotting even before the echoes of the ritual died away. It absolutely destroyed our friendship.'' \n \n `` He was still the same nice guy. I did n't think he smelled too bad.'' \n \n `` You live atop a mountain in the tundra. My palace was in the tropics.'' \n \n `` Point. Well, anyway, Tom makes his parting speech which I believe you had written.'I leave you now in misery, you mewling child. You are a puking baby before the might of my empire; the beauty of your girl is the only fitting companion for my dark majesty. The Hand of Darkness is not ungenerous: I leave you your life, so you can enjoy this gift of immaculate suffering.''' \n \n At this, the seer turned to peer up at the overlord with one disdainful eye. `` John, I have got to level with you. You had a serious PR problem. The Ether might never have coughed up the prophecy if you were not so insistent on the black darkness and evil thing.'' \n \n John was taken aback. `` You know this sort of thing is color coded. Light is white and gold, and those are unflattering to my complexion - they wash me out. Evil is black, and I *own* black. Besides, evil is relative. I reduced taxes and the roads were never safer.'' \n \n `` True, but perception is everything,'' the seer said. He frowned. \n \n `` What is it?'' \n \n `` This vision is even shorter than I thought it would be.'' \n \n John frowned. `` How short?'' \n \n `` Uhh... looks like it'll be done in about ten minutes.'' \n \n `` Ten minutes! I chose that ignorant farmhand because he lived in the furthest corner of my empire! I built obstacles that would take a mythic hero months to overcome!'' He started to stammer. `` Th-there was three fucking mountain ranges in between us! Leagues of tangled jungle! AN OCEAN!'' \n \n `` Well, he found a way to skip it,'' the seer said. `` Perhaps he was a very powerful mage, a once-in-a-millenium type?'' \n \n John was so distraught he could barely speak. He gestured angrily at the cauldron. The seer turned and peered into it again. \n \n `` He's moonwalking into the door of his own burning house,'' the seer said. \n \n `` He's what?'' \n \n `` Walking backwards but he appears to go forwards,'' the seer said. `` I've only ever seen it in the Ether. Where did he learn how to do that?'' \n \n `` Into the door of his burning house?'' \n \n `` That's right. He's just bumping into it - no, wait,'' the seer said. `` He just opened the door with his back still to it... and he stepped into his house, and fell through the ground.'' \n \n `` So he is a mage,'' John said. \n \n `` No, this is definitely not magic. Looks like plain old physics to me.'' \n \n John started to turn red. He was in exile, but his face was the very picture of imperious discontent. A vein throbbed in his temple and he pulled at his collar to loosen it. \n \n `` And he's falling through the world... still falling... still falling, falling through time now as well it seems.'' \n \n John looked into the cauldron. He could see the idiotic, sandy-haired teenager falling through the blackness, moonwalking all the while. \n \n `` There it is!'' \n \n All at once, the boy fell into John's bedroom. John, of course, was not there - he was sitting in his throne room, pissing into a bucket, waiting for the boy to show up. He had been extremely diligent on maintaining his presence there at all times - the prophecy had foreseen an epic confrontation there that he actually did stand a substantial chance of winning, even had the boy completed his adventure properly and learned all that would have come with the journey. \n \n And of course, there was Heather in the bedroom with the dopey looking bell-end. She was a radiant beauty, red haired, with the measurements and flawless skin of a goddess. That she somehow had red hair, light eyes, but could tan as deeply as a Persian made her the most supremely gorgeous woman in the kingdom. \n \n `` I still ca n't believe you said she was the key to the kingdom, and the man to bed her would become the new king,'' the seer said. \n \n `` I could n't get her to put out any other way.'' She had been totally okay with her new living arrangement after that. \n \n `` She looks a little unfaithful,'' the seer said. He was leering at the vision now. \n \n John upended the cauldron. The vision-juice, or whatever it was, started eating away at the rock floor immediately, smoking and bubbling. `` She was his before I stole her away, I guess. She was certainly worth the kingdom, though.'' \n \n The seer was quiet. \n \n John suddenly snapped, kicking his feet and thrashing his arms around. In a shrill, childish voice he began to scream. `` This just is n't fair! How is that fair! He walked into a door like a fucking idiot for two minutes and fell right into my own fucking bedroom! He was literally five feet away from a hole in space and fucking time that put him exactly where he needed to be! How is that possible? ***How did he know!? *** This planet's a prison of stupid bullshit! FUCK!'' \n \n The seer edged quietly out of his cave while John's tantrum continued. \n\n"}

A man pulled open the hatch, his hardened eyes, scanning the ruins, corpses, and discarded possessions that had once made this charred wasteland a city. \n \n He turned inward to the tank `` Klaus, take us forward, slow, everyone keep a lookout, damn Ivan loves ruins like this.'' The Panzer's engine growled slightly at first and then began to roar, Han's felt he heard the years of hard fighting taking their toll on his beloved tank, patting it lovingly he began to scour the ruins ahead, a shape moved and Hans swore he heard Siegfried growl, `` Klaus, take us to a stop, Albert, load High Explosives, Gunther, take aim, 30 degrees.'' The echos of `` Jawohl panzerkommandant'' gave Hans relief, his men would not let him down, he glanced at the machinegun to his right and readied himself. \n \n With a thunderous crash the ruins up ahead began to disintegrate, revealing the massive and intimidating form of a Soviet tank. \n \n `` Shiesse! Stalin tank! Klaus, take us through those ruins to the left, Gunther, aim for the tracks, we do n't have a chance of penetrating the armor.'' \n \n The roar of the Soviet's gun seemed to spring Hans' men into action, he glanced to his left as his tank turned and ground through the walls of an apartment complex, the wall groaned and protested, but was no match for the superior German engineering, dust and rubble rained on Hans as \n his Siegfried crashed into the safety of the apartment. As the Germans ground through the former home's of the city's citizens Han's found himself rather curiously drawn to an old and dusty wardrobe, relatively unharmed by the fighting, he felt a small bit of regret as he noticed that the lovely furniture was destined to meet Siegfried's armored tracks, that regret turned into panic as he felt his tank physically descend into the wardrobe, he felt himself impact harshly against the cupola, then darkness. \n \n Hans awoke to the cold touch of snow his back to the hard steel frame of Siegfried, and bandage around his arm. He found himself in a forest, very much like the one's from his childhood in Eastern Germany, a small snowfall blanketed the ground and beneath the confusion dread and stress Hans found a momentary measure of peace in the cool silent forest. Glancing to his right he noticed his men, crowded curiously around a sole streetlight in the middle of the forest. Gunther was the first to notice the conscience state of their commander and ran over to him. \n \n `` Gunther where in the devil are we?''' \n \n `` I have no idea herr Panzerkommandant, one moment we were in the middle of Kharkov, killing Ivan once again, the next we were here, we sort of, fell, I do n't know how else to put it.'' \n \n Hans nodded and tried to stand up, a slight pain shot through his chest and arm, but he grimaced through it, for the sake of his men, he needed to look strong, they needed to be able to put faith in their commander, he leaned painfully against the tank, turning towards his radioman Steffan, `` Try and raise Commander Bauer, tell him... tell him we're lost... somewhere... outside the city, just... I do n't know''. \n \n `` That's just the problem, Hans, I do n't have any contact.'' \n \n `` Alright, raise headquarters, they've got better radios, or just... raise someone...''. \n \n `` You misunderstand me sir, I ca n't raise anyone, as far as I can tell we're a thousand miles from Kharkov, hell we could be in Siberia for all I know''. \n \n Gunther interjected `` Just what the hell is going on Kommandant, what the hell happened?!'' \n \n `` I do n't know, but we'll figure it out, my guess would be we... we must have been knocked unconscious and Siegfried carried us all away... out of the city.'' Hans found himself doubting the answer himself, grasping at straws. \n \n Klaus, shook his head `` Nien Panzer Kommandant, we could barely make it out of Kharkov conscience, that city was a deathtrap, drifting blindly forward... besides look at Siegfried, she's not any more scratched than she was this morning, no, something else happened...'' \n \n As sudden break of a twig from deep in the forest brought the crew to alert, Hans drew his pistol, acutely aware of the fact that his accuracy would suffer terribly from his left hand shooting. He positioned himself behind a log and noted with silent pride that his men, with no word from him had already followed his example and drawn whatever weapons they had. \n \n Instead of communists however, a young girl appeared from a break in the trees, glancing first at the oil lamp that had enthralled his men before, and then at the 25 tons of misplaced German war machine. Hans could see alarm forming in the young girl's eyes, he left his pistol, behind the log and slowly emerged from behind the log, casting his best disarming smile. `` \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430?''

He held up one finger, hoping desperately that the girl would interpret the international signal of `` wait just a moment''. \n \n Hans walked slowly back to the tank, in an attempt not to alarm the girl who was clearly almost as confused to have a German tank appear in what was probably her backyard as Hans was to have his German tank appear in what was probably her backyard. \n \n Hans turned when he reached the back of the tank and motioned for Klaus, `` You speak English right?'' \n \n Klaus cast him a confused look `` Ja, why? did you figure out where we are?'' \n \n `` No but that girl appears to speak English, go an have a word with her, would you?'' \n \n Klaus nodded, leaned his machinegun up to the tank and turned to confront the stranger. Hans turned and addressed his men `` Right, there might be a possibility that we are quite very deep into allied lines, and I made a decision, if we find ourselves hopelessly trapped we are to surrender you hear? I wo n't have you throw away your lives needlessly'' \n \n Albert was clearly taken aback `` but Herr Panzerkommandant, the Fuhre-'' \n \n `` The Fuhrer is not here Albert, I know you are inexperienced to the art of war, but there is a time to run and a time to fight, this appea-'' \n \n `` Hans?''

These were the men I \u2019 d led when I overthrew the monarchy, good solid men, who \u2019 d believed me when I said we needed to rule for the betterment of all. \n \n *How did we get so lost? * \n \n That had been years ago, and things had not gone smoothly. The monarchy \u2019 s policy of nepotism may have led to terrible governance, but it was very entrenched terrible governance. It had been a struggle at first, fighting against all that money, all those who had so much. But we had managed it, as a brotherhood, against all odds, all predictions from the international media. \n \n But it had not been smooth. The first night when we took the king and his family hostage, we had thought to keep them prisoners. A stray bullet from an overly zealous royal guard, into gas tanks we had used to cut into their inner sanctuary put an end to that plan. The condemnations had grown swiftly after that, and so had the fear. And I had thought, we can not convince them otherwise, so we did it, and take what little benefit we can get. Then came the famine, caused by my rule it was said, either by need for food for the army or by my ungodliness, it all depended on who you asked. \n \n Everything had changed in the jungle, when I had hunted down Marshal Pangaren. The only capable cousin in the monarchy, he had proved too much for my lieutenants. I had dealt with him myself. \n \n He died arrogantly but bravely, and so did his men. They thought they could do what we did. But it is not so easy to fight against tanks with small arms, once the tables are turned. \n \n The storm that followed had been righteous, scattering what was left of his men to the winds. And my own column as well. \n I thought I might die out there, in the wind and the mud and the rain. All those battles and now this. My legs did not have much strength left when I found a small house. I banged on the door, demanding aid. They did not open. I went for my gun, before realizing it was lost. As I stood there the door opened, and an old man with a prehistoric shotgun looked at me. \n \n The kindness that followed, the sharing of food when they did not have enough for themselves, despite knowing who I was, that I was responsible for the death of their son, their brother, their father, who had fought against me in that battle, reminded me why I had done what I had done. \n \n When I returned, all were in good spirits.

Well, I was hardly going to carry it around with me. \n \n I stuffed my hands in my pockets and hunched my shoulders. What kind of person comes half way up a mountain to cheat on their husband? He'd insisted I follow her, and he was paying me a good rate, but I could n't shake the feeling that he was an idiot. Apparently she'd been acting odd and taking off for hours at a time. When I'd told him she was at the foot of a mountain in hiking gear I was ready to head home, case closed. But no, no, no. She was n't a hiker. \n \n Well, fucking obviously she is! But hey, I'm getting paid, right? So there I was, standing in the trees like some kind of pervert watching this chick eat a snickers bar. I'm lucky enough that there's tree cover here, you can hardly follow someone along a path with no cover without being seen. \n \n Last of her snack down, she moved off again. About fucking time, too, bad enough I have to freeze my balls off up here without standing around for ten hours. That was when, to my great surprise, she actually did something unusual. Rather than set off up the track as I'd expected, she looked around for anyone who could see her ( missing me by an inch, I reckon ) and opened her rucksack. She took out what looked from where I stood like a dreamcatcher, the kind a kid would hang over their bed. Well, weird as shit, but not too suspicious. But then she starts walking into the trees where she hung it. Shit. So, I set off in pursuit, I was a good way behind her and neither of us were on a path now. \n \n So at this point I'm thinking maybe my client has a point, poor fucker. But rather than thinking *this is n't an affair* I was just off in pursuit. Probably caused a fair racket crashing through those trees, but I kept her in sight ahead of me, not aided by her brown and green attire mind, when she broke into a run. Shit, well, she's fairly trying to avoid being followed, I thought. \n \n So, I followed suit. And this forest is getting thick now, like, I'm jumping over shit left right and fucking centre in my nice shoes and coat. Do n't know what I was thinking, I mean there's only so much I'll do for a hundred quid, you know? Thank fuck, then, she stopped at that point. I dropped as low as I could where I could see, and boy what did I see! \n \n She stopped in a clearing, but man this far into the woods it was dark. I noticed that and started worrying like... Am I lost? Well, fuck, I'd got there so I watched. More people appeared in the clearing then, all of them in hiking gear with bags stuffed. And they just stood there. Maybe five minutes later they were still arriving, and thank fuck none of them from the same direction as my mark, or I'd have been spotted no bother. \n \n So after some amount of time, I do n't know ten minutes or something, they all just fucking move. Bags off, bags open, shit coming out all over the place. I could n't even see what was going on most of the time, hands waving, sticks flying about. Once they calmed down they were all wearing fucking robes. Yeah, *robes* for fucks sake. So I was suitably pissing myself laughing, who are these weirdos? Wiccans? Managed to contain myself long enough to shit myself, however, when a fucking light starts up in the middle of the lot of them. They'd arranged themselves in a circle, and... Lights. Glowy shite in the middle and, oh christ the *noise*! There was this noise like nothing I've heard before or since. \n \n Suffice to say I fucked the fuck off out of there like a mad thing, but when it got loudest I glanced back and honestly I do n't know what I saw. Did n't look like trees behind me, there was that light in the distance and then just... shadows. Dark things moving about. After that I do n't remember a thing but running.

Those who did not undergo enhancements died while we inherited what they left behind. \n \n \n I blinked and I was 10,000. The universe was too strange for my feeble old brain.

I withdrew. \n \n \n In my isolation, I missed the passing of my last child and did n't even realize I had experienced the end of happiness. \n \n \n But so much is obvious to you. Undoubtedly, you are recording this same monologue right now. We are the same because we alone have survived. We alone, replicated from that infant reaching for a cosmos so immense he could n't conceive it, have found the universe too tiny. Whether it was boredom or something else, I can not say, but the others have all exercised the one truly inalienable right of life and left us to ponder this vast meaninglessness alone. But as we approach our fifth full order of magnitude, firmly securing the high score, all the solace I can find is in the knowledge that there are more orders to live through. \n\n"}

This will be *your* office in a few more days. \u201d \n \n \u201c Thank you, sir, \u201d the younger man said, and sat down in the polished leather of the chair. \n \n \u201c We \u2019 re not to be disturbed, \u201d the Port Captain said to his secretary, and closed the office door firmly. \u201c There is one more thing I need to share with you, before you \u2019 re responsible for all of *this. \u201d * \n \n \u2018 This \u2019 included the whole harbour. Through the 360-degree windows of the Tower, he could see the masts of the clippers and wind-jammers in Cape Town's harbour basins. Beyond the forest of masts, he could see the immense wall of Table Mountain, looming over the town. \n \n \u201c Any tips that you can give me will come in handy, sir. \u201d \n \n `` Good,'' the Port Captain said. He turned to look out of the windows, his hands clasped loosely behind his back, as if he stood on the quarterdeck of a fast windjammer. \n \n His successor waited. \n \n \u201c This port of ours, \u201d the Port Captain said, looking out over the harbour, \u201c this so-called Tavern of the Seas is the half-way point of the British Empire. We have Europe and the Americas on one side; China and India and Arabia on the other. For hundreds of years, ships have battled their way around this coast against the prevailing wind. Thousands of ships have been wrecked on these shores. All ships, from all countries, *must* pass this point. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, sir? \u201d He knew all that already, he thought. He was younger than his predecessor, but he was an experienced man of the sea. He had been appointed to this position because he was the most qualified man for the job. He did not need a history lesson. \n \n The Port Captain turned to him. His blocky figure was silhouetted against the masts of the ships behind him. \n \n \u201c There \u2019 s something you need to know, Captain, before you take up your post, \u201d he said. \u201c There is one last duty that the Port Captains here do not share with any other harbour, anywhere in the world, and it is my last duty to share it with you. \u201d \n \n \u201c Should I take notes, captain? \u201d \n \n \u201c No, it \u2019 s not necessary. The hardest part of this duty is merely to understand it. You see, captain \u2013 just as we here are at the cross-roads of the sea here, we also lie at the intersection of time itself. \u201d \n \n \u201c I beg your pardon, sir? \u201d \n \n \u201c Time, \u201d the old man said. \u201c Time itself. Time intersects with itself at the Cape. And this too will be your duty, in a few more days. I pass it to you, as it was passed to me by my predecessor, who was taught by his. All the way back to the old Dutch governors in the days of the spice trade, and the old Khoi chieftains before them. And now it \u2019 s yours. \u201d \n \n \u201c I see, sir. \u201d He wondered if the old man had suffered a mild fit of apoplexy, but his eyes seemed clear. Insanity, then; the stress of running this port could do that to a man, he imagined. He ran his fingers over his whiskers, hoping he was not showing his disbelief too openly. \n \n \u201c You don \u2019 t believe me, of course, \u201d the Port Captain said. \u201c I did not believe it either, when I was on that side of the desk. \u201d He reached into his pocket and drew out a key. He turned to one of the cabinets under the windows, unlocked it, and slid the drawer out. He removed a manila folder, and turned around. He opened the folder reverently on his desk. \n \n There was a large daguerreotype inside. The old man turned it around so that the younger man could see it. \n \n The new captain leaned forward. In the sepia murk of the old print, he saw a coastline; the familiar rocky outline of Table Bay. In the foreground, an object rode in the sea. It was low and black as a boot, with a solid tower rising from the middle. For a moment he thought it was a cobbler \u2019 s last, but it must have been gigantic, the size of a ship. \n \n \u201c My predecessor took this photograph, \u201d the Port Captain said. \u201c This is the ship that will *never* be recorded by your office, but you will have to go out in the pilot boat and meet her. \u201d \n \n There were other pictures in the folder \u2013 old engravings, old line-and-water colour paintings, old drawings. Pages of yellow notes, written in spidery copperplate. The new captain touched the folder, and filed through them. All the pictures portrayed the same strange object in the sea. \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s not a ship. \u201d \n \n \u201c That is a ship, \u201d the old man said. \u201c I \u2019 ve seen her moving under power. She travels under the sea, like the *Nautilus* in the novel. \u201d \n \n The younger man looked closer. Now that he looked at it, he could see that the strange black object had a distinct bone in her teeth. She *was* a ship. She was even moving under her own power! \n \n \u201c How on earth do you maintain a head of steam in that? \u201d \n \n \u201c She doesn \u2019 t, \u201d the Port Captain said. \u201c The captain explained to Governor Van Der Stel back in the 17th Century that she is powered by something called a New-Clear Re-enactor \u2013 similar to our modern steamers, but far more powerful. The New-Clear Re-enactor malfunctioned somehow, but instead of sinking her, it set her adrift in time. \u201d \n \n \u201c Adrift in time? \u201d \n \n \u201c She \u2019 s been seen off the Cape every seven years for the last thousand years or so, give or take a few tides. I saw her in 1879; you will see her in 1886. Not that they \u2019 ll see *you* in 1886. They never know *when* they are, but every seven years she anchors out there in the Roads. You \u2019 ll supply her with fresh fruit and vegetables, and news, just like any other ship. And of course the captain *always* wants to know what year he's arrived in. \u201d \n \n \u201c But that \u2019 s impossible, sir! Time doesn \u2019 t work that way! \u201d \n \n \u201c Time does n't. But the sea does what the sea will do, \u201d the Port Captain shrugged his shoulders. \u201c There are thousands of shipwrecks all over this coast. Think of this ship as one more old shipwreck \u2013 but not from the past. From the *future. \u201d * \n \n \u201c I see. \u201d \n \n \u201c No, you don \u2019 t, \u201d the old man said. The teasing twinkle in his eye revealed the carefree blue-water sailor he had been in his youth. \u201c You think that you do, but until you lay eyes on her yourself, you can not grasp the fact of her. The captain will explain more, when you meet him. He is a good man. Must be an excellent leader, to hold his crew together for so long under such circumstances. His name is Van Der Decken. \u201d \n \n \u201c Van Der Decken? The *Flying Dutchman! \u201d * the young captain said. He snatched up the daguerrotype again, and stared at it. \u201c She \u2019 s the *Flying Dutchman! \u201d * \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s what they called her in the old days, \u201d the Port Captain grinned. \u201c The story has been a trifle *garbled* over the centuries. \u201d \n \n \u201c She \u2019 s from the future? \u201d \n \n \u201c She \u2019 s from the future, \u201d the Port Captain agreed. \u201c And now she \u2019 s your duty. Just as I am handing her over to you, as the Khoi handed her down to us, you will hand her on to your successor. One day she will land by chance in her own time, and then she will be free to round the Cape of Good Hope, and go home. \u201d \n \n \u201c But until then? \u201d \n \n \u201c Until then, \u201d the old man said. * \u201c We are* the Port Captains of the Cape of Good Hope. We will welcome her, and resupply her, and remind the crew that they are *not* forgotten. That is what we have always done; that is what we will always do. For as long as it takes. \u201d \n \n `` For as long as it takes,'' the new Port Captain agreed. He put the daguerreotype back into the folder, and closed it. `` Thank you, Captain.

Not today, not before the interview. The harder he tried, the more helpless he felt. The bright flashes synced with his heartbeat as the splitting headache was now grew stronger, and his whole body felt so much heavier than a few moments ago. \n \n Another electric surge followed, and suddenly everything went dark and silent, for a moment before the flashing bight lights came back. There was nothing but the flashes and the sound of his heartbeat now. \n \n *This is different, it has never happened before* \n \n He suddenly felt a force pulling him down through the center of his stomach. This force, just like everything else, originated almost instantaneously and grew exponentially. He tried resisting, but it was too strong. He let go. \n \n *dud dud* the heartbeat was followed by another spike of electricity. \n \n He is in an elevator with the woman. Theres nobody but them. She's wearing blue jeans and a full sleeved, loose tshirt. Her hair smelt like fresh daises. He never noticed how beautiful she really was. She's looking up at the digital screen as his focus is entirely on her now. She glances at him as he smiles stupidly. A strand of her hair falls on her face as she giggles, extending her right arm to introduce herself as she holds a bunch of files in her left hand. \n \n *dud dud* *He notices the heartbeat getting faster* as another sudden electric shock follows \n \n He sees a big clock, it's almost midnight. Engulfed in loud music, the crowd is celebrating. Senses tell him that someone's holding his right hand. He looks to find the woman beside him. He does n't know anyone else around, but it does n't matter anymore. Her hand feels warm and he grips on tight. \n \n *dud dud* *dud dud* *electric shock* \n \n He is in a hospital bed surrounded by faces he can not recognize. There's blood on his chest as he notices the monitors around him. Through the crowd appears the woman, worry and angst written on her face. He extends his left arm as she carefully caresses it, tears streaming down her red cheeks. The doctors pull her apart as they rush him away. \n \n *dud dud* *dud dud* *dud dud* *The electric shocks start getting stronger* \n \n The beautiful woman is standing by a hammock, looking at him. Behind her is the bluest ocean he's ever seen. She smiles warmly as he notices her mid length white gown. She's holding a bouquet of red roses as bells ring in the distance. A classic open top white car decorated with flowers awaits. \n \n *dud dud* *dud dud* *dud dud* *dud dud* *electric shock* \n \n He is at the hospital with her. This time she's in the bed, surrounded by nurses. Tears streaming down his face, he can feel his insides grip as the woman is struggles through it. The air is dense as the doctor removes his gloves and hugs him. Through the blurry vision emerges a newborn with her mother. \n \n *dud dud* *dud dud* *dud dud* *dud dud* *shocks last longer this time as his body can not take any more* \n \n Suddenly, the peculiar light stench of unwashed carpets and the thick air of the 10th floor howitt hall fill his lungs. He's back, though not completely just yet. \n \n `` what was that.. I've never felt it like that before!'' Max recalled the visions as he tried to get back to his senses. \n \n Max was an extraodinary kid, one of a kind. Every time his skin came in contact with someone else's, similar visions to the one he just had would show his future with that person. Thus far, the visions had been an unrepeatable phenomenon. He suspected that was because more often than not, the futures with most people were short and the chances of it changing over time were bleak. The intensity and the duration of the visions were dependent on how much of a future was to be seen. For most people that Max had met in his lifetime, the visions were nothing more than just a quick bright flash, something similar to the reflection of sunlight from a distant window. It was a sign of short future with little to no chances of any change. \n \n It was n't long before he was back in his senses as he found himself on the floor right outside the elevator. A warm, petite hand was gently trying to shake him up. He heard a gentle, soothing feminine voice calling out his name. \n `` Could she be the one?'' he thought to himself, as he turned around on his back to find the same woman who he'd seen in his visions. \n \n `` are you okay?'' she asked, the familiar look of worry etched on her face. \n `` huh.. I do n't know what that was'' he said as got onto his feet. This vision was the strongest, he thought to as he tried to regain composure. \n `` You had us so worried. Rob has gone to get some help! What happened'' she said, brushing his shirt off. He felt the same warm touch that he had felt in the visions. \n \n It was this instant when he realized that he was still horribly late for the interview. Glancing at his watch, he breathed a sigh of relief. 10:25am. The vision had lasted around 5 minutes. This was the first to have lasted this long. As a young child, his visions last around 2 to 3 minutes because he was getting to know his family. But nothing had lasted this long, and nothing had come close to being as intense. \n \n `` Max?'' \n `` Yeah sorry, I lost my footing while coming out. I really need to get to 256th Turner by 11, i have a really important interview'' Max said as turned around to face the elevator. \n `` Lets get you on the ground floor first.'' she said as they got in. `` We saw you run out like a madman and drop dead on to the floor. Rob ran down to get help'' \n `` I'm sorry, i just happen to have the most important interview of my life today, and i'm late for it'' he said nervously, glancing down at his watch. 10:31am. \n `` what actually happened?'' \n `` I.. I..'' he stammered as he desperately looked for logical avenues to explain his visions. It was n't as though everyday a grown man would drop dead for 5 minutes whilst running outside the elevator, then proceed to get up and be on his merry way almost as though nothing had happened. He felt a strong urge to tell her the truth. `` Whats the worst that could happen?'' he said, \n \n `` You will not believe me'' he replied, his eyes looking straight into hers. \n `` What?'' \n `` You will not believe what just happened'' \n `` Why? try me'' \n `` I can see the future, i've had this ability since i was a child'' \n `` uh huh'' she replied, squinting her eyes.. \n `` Everytime i touch someone for the first time, i forsee my future with them. When my arm touched your shoulder, i foresaw our future together.'' \n `` Riight'' she replied slower, almost amused as she tried comprehending what he had just said. The sparkle in her eyes was exactly what max had seen in his vision. She glanced down at a couple of folders she held, in an attempt to hide her amusement. \n \n Forcefully putting on a serious face. She glanced up at the digital screen which read'3rd floor'. \n \n This is exactly what max had seen. \n \n `` I saw that we celebrated new years together, and I am going to marry you someday'' Max said confidently, as he looked straight into her eyes. \n \n She turned around, a strand of hair on her face as her smile grew bigger. `` You're funny. I'm Emma'' she said, extending her right arm. \n \n \n \n\n"}

The universe is filled with other space-capable sentient life - but all other species rely on different forms of magic , despoiling science as something humanity made up to protect their own form of magic .\n","story":"It was probably something our ancestors knew from the start, consciousness being the center of achievable reality that is. In hindsight there were signs, instead of accepting psychics we ridiculed them, instead of listening to those with outrageous views we sent them to mental institutions. Perhaps, like with anything in history, it was always to be the persecutors, our scientific society, that were always doomed to fail and crumble. \n \n \n Now we understand that Rupert Sheldrake was right, our very fabric of reality is ever flowing and ever changing. He predicted subtle changes but never could have known that it was in truth our very notions that held it together. Who would have known what the law of attraction could yield. Knowledge that was released to the masses and adopted by few eventually led us to prove that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle not only applied to an electron, but rather conscious reality. Until it is perceived it is everywhere and all possibilities are true, that is now our world. \n \n \n All our knowledge was dismantled when Elon Musk and his space X team developed the warp drive, a means to bend the fabric of space-time and `` bring the location to you'' as he put it. At first it was nothing more than distant planets with microbial life we discovered but one day it happened. The world had gotten over the shock that we are not alone in the universe but somehow expected to be the only ones with advanced technologies for a number of decades at least. That is when what we now call the Specters arrived on the scene. We discovered a device on a planet, similar to the one at Cern and had Google's Deep Mind AI technology reverse engineer it. To our dismay it turned out to be an advanced multidimensional transporter, allowing matter to be trans-mutated to one of 11 other dimensions. It operated on nothing we had ever seen before, it was powered by intention, that was our first clue something was up! \n \n 200 years passed until the human race organised themselves to operate the device and sent the first person through. Ancestors who had been downloaded into computers during the 2045 movement waited eagerly along with those of us who were in body form at the time to see what the result would be. For 2 years nothing came back until one day all the planets that we were inhabiting were surrounded by what I can only describe as a shimmering veil. The veil itself was as if looking through a holographic AR set, with our reality then looking more like the projection than the physical. All of a sudden it was gone and I was standing in a ball of light, it seemed as if I was on the inside of the sun looking out. Other balls of light came towards me and began to speak. They spoke in tones that I understood but were like no words I had ever heard, then it all went dark as I fell inward to what looked like a black hole. \n \n \n When I awoke I was greeted by others that explained how the new world work, everything was intention based and materialized like magic, we had the ability to do whatever we wanted. Most importantly however is that we were informed that the universe we once lived in was like an egg or a test, preparing us for the ascension through the layers of dimensions. \n \n I write this with the perception of 5 dimensions to you, a letter to your 4 dimensional self.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In a parallel universe where heavy metal is a classy and exquisite form of entertainment and classical music is rebellious and edgy , a young violinist is trying to make it big and never conform to the lame norms of the society\n","story":"The dirty looks were immediate. As soon as Tristan stepped onto the subway car, every other passenger immediately became vastly interested in their newspapers, books, and phones. Earbuds were retrieved from purses and put in ears, even if they were n't plugged in. Anything to avoid looking right at him. Among all of the black clothing and spiked jewelry of the stuffy businessmen, Tristan knew he looked out of place in his pressed slacks and button-up shirt. Some of the passengers, eyeing the leather violin case in his hand, even took the risk of jumping out the door and moving to the next car before the train got moving again. Tristan ignored them. The door slid closed with a soft *whoosh*, and he snapped open the locks of the case. \n \n He lifted the violin the way a mother holds her child. It fit so perfectly on his shoulder, like it had been custom-made for him. He \u2019 d found the old Strad in a second-hand store way out in Queens, covered in dust and marked down to the whopping price of \u201c any offer will do. \u201d It had taken years of careful restoration, but he \u2019 d finally brought it back to its former glory. Not that anyone ever noticed. As he touched the bow to the strings for the first time, he tuned out the eye rolls and whispers of the other passengers. \n \n Up and down the aisle, Tristan played Tchaikovsky \u2019 s Violin Concerto for them. Some of them turned up their headphones to drown it out with whatever death metal and screamo was popular today. Others simply glared at him, *outraged* that he \u2019 d dare ask for money for annoying them so. \n \n \u201c Hey, man, \u201d a frat-boy type in a torn leather jacket shouted, emerging into the center of the aisle to block his path and clapping a strong hand on Tristan \u2019 s shoulder that sent the bow skewing off with a sour note, \u201c Play some Slayer! \u201d A group of his friends cackled like hyenas at this exceedingly clever joke. \n \n \u201c Yeah! How about some Sabbath? \u201d Another round of giggles. \n \n \u201c Love the style, dude, \u201d said one with a neon-pink mohawk. He reached over and messed up Tristan \u2019 s neatly-parted naturally-colored hair. \n \n \u201c Hey, respect, man, \u201d another one said, dripping with sarcasm. \u201c Good work on that last one. Here \u2019 s a little something for your troubles. \u201d He wiped his nose on a napkin and stuffed it into Tristan \u2019 s empty change cup. That sent the others into uproarious gales of laughter and back-slapping. \n \n Tristan ignored them, making his way back up the car and doing his best to pick up where he \u2019 d been interrupted. A woman in a skin-tight leather dress with a studded choker dropped a quarter into his can, more as a way to get Tristan to move away rather than out of appreciation for his music. But other than that, nothing. The train began to slow as it arrived at the next stop. \n \n He finished his song just in time for the doors to chime open. No one clapped, or even particularly noticed. Tristan thanked them anyway, met with more eye rolls. No one else seemed interested in donating, so Tristan grabbed his case and stepped off the train to move to the next car. But just before he made it through the doorway, the chimes sounded and it slid shut right in his face. \n \n \u201c Figures, \u201d Tristan said. He gingerly put the violin back into its case and headed toward the exit; this was close enough to home, and it was already 6 PM. Any later and his rumbling stomach would be louder than his music. So he headed up the stairs out of the station. \n \n \u201c HEY! \u201d a voice shouted behind him. \n \n Tristan sighed. More frat boys? Maybe they wanted to yank his tie or dirty his clean clothes? He ignored the person and kept going. \n \n \u201c Hey, man, \u201d the voice said again, hustling up the stairs to come up next to him. It was just another generic office drone: Converse sneakers, ripped black jeans, a worn Metallica shirt, and a biker jacket. The entire ensemble was really completed by the black fingers, done with sharpie instead of nail polish. \n \n \u201c What? \u201d Tristan asked him. He just wanted to get this shit over with so he could go home and have some dinner. \n \n \u201c Good work in there. I really liked it. \u201d Tristan waited for the inevitable \u201c but it needed more electric guitar! \u201d crap. But the man didn \u2019 t have more to say. Instead, the man looked around the stairwell to make sure no one was around, then lifted his shirt. He wore a nice, presentable leather belt around his waist, just like Tristan. \u201c Keep it up. \u201d And to add to the compliment, he stuffed a $ 5 bill in Tristan \u2019 s change cup, then hurried up the stairs and out onto the streets. \n \n Tristan followed him out, headed home with a smile on his face for the first time in a long while. \n \n -- -- \n \n As always, subscribe to \/r\/Luna_Lovewell if you liked this one! \n\n"}

They said it was to keep things uniform or unvarying -- some people just really like bad porn, so we have to keep it alive. Some people prefer good porn... and some people just enjoy weird shit. We also have to make sure that we can do this over multiple mediums -- for example, for crossover work, obscure stuff is basically always fanfiction, but artwork hits the most people on average. And videos are generally used for literally anything. \n \n But you probably know us from our work. We're the people who created shitting dick nipples. We're the people who made Catholic [ insert your fandom here ] porn. Have you ever gone to fanfiction.net and seen a fiction between an obscure character from Tekken and one of the DDR dancers?

There is a team of other officers within the Rule 34 Unit whose sole job it is to search two random terms on DeviantArt and see if the first page has porn of those two things. If not, we Eunuchs get called in to make it. \n \n Eunuchs have to go through some pretty strict training, but it's not too bad of a job, to be honest. Basically, we have to make some sort of uniquely good and bad work for a subject, which means we need to understand the fanbase, then cater to their general wants. There's another officer who infiltrates the fanbase and comes back to us and gives us specific guidelines to make our work perfect for a specific fanbase. The reason for this is twofold: If it's semi-popular within the fanbase, then the fans themselves will start to copy it, thus we would've created a cycle of porn. If it's so bad it's tossed out by the fanbase, some nonfan will latch on to it and share it, normally to mock the fanbase, and usually that will spawn some clones of the original work. So it has to be a perfect representation of the fanbase and the source material -- just good enough to be accepted, just bad enough to be a reflection of the life choices the fanbase has made leading up to this point. And trust me, if you write, draw, or video enough of this stuff, you'll become an eunuch. Nothing will get you off but the weirdest stuff, and how can you keep up a relationship with anyone when the only thing that gets you off is live action octopi screwing cars with anime girls inside? Eventually, you'll have mentally castrated yourself just so you can get through a drawing or a fiction or a video without hating yourself. \n \n My job's not that bad, but to be honest I'm hoping to transfer to the division that houses Rule 47. All they do is bust into people's houses before they have sex and airlift them to safe locations where they ca n't have sex. I hear the people who fly helicopters for the Rule 47 Enforcement Division are called Cockblockers. No idea why, but I'd love to be one of them!\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You find an unattended wallet\/handbag ...\n","story":"`` A wallet?'' I asked myself as I was on my morning commute through the subway. Its on the rails, sitting unattended, possibly with money in it. *Its calling me, * I subconsciously tell myself. I do n't think to myself that I am crazy - I'm not that kind of person. If my brain wants me to do something, I do it - and I do n't look around to see if anyone is observing. I'm a modest guy. I walked down to the edge, and hopped off. As I heard the gasps of the crowd, I chuckled. *As long as I do n't touch the third rail, I'm okay, * I thought to myself. \n \n As I bent to pick it up, a man in a suit shook his head'no' at me. I thought nothing of it, and picked it up. Shortly after, the yells of someone in the crowd rang in my ear, `` Watch out!'' A train was approaching. In my confusion, I stumble, and land in the middle of the tracks, thankfully untouched by the electricity. I held the wallet up, almost as a shield, hoping that this piece of discarded leather would protect me. And then it did. \n \n My eyes were closed, so I ca n't recall exactly what happened, but I felt a shock wave come from my hand - no, the wallet - and heard a smash. Then the deafening ring. I opened up my eyes, and saw the train - in the roof of the subway. Scattered clusters of flames covered the debris I had caused. I looked at the wallet and noticed the sign on it. Some kind of ring with writings on it in what I presumed to be Japanese or something. It glowed, so then I realized that it stopped the train. I looked to my right after hearing a clicking sound, and saw the suited man was pointing a 9.mm handgun into my face. `` I told you no,'' he said before shooting. This time, instinctively, I held up the magic wallet and it deflected the bullet right back into the man's forehead. His body crumpled like a rag doll as I heard more footsteps rushing to my location. Guns cocking. I found something I was n't supposed to, and I was going to find out what it was. I ran away, and out of the subway wondering where this wallet would lead me from - or away from - next. \n \n ( ( Sorry it was so long! ) )\n"}

While they get to converse with aliens and learn ancient languages written in the stars, we are making their guests' lunches. How can they eat this blue stuff? It reminds me of human feces mixed with Jello. While these guys test technology beyond our wildest dreams, we are over here making safety equipment for it.

You do n't want to have to deal with that!'' Yeah? Sounds a lot better than making jello meals and telling everyone that 51 is just your average military station. Yup, we are 51's PR branch too. You know how all the conspiracy theorists get pissed when the Area 51 Wiki article is changed in seconds? That's us. You know how there are press releases and online articles going `` Area 51 is not what you think it is''? We do those too. We also work the cloaking process of 51. Do you really think that what you see on Google Maps is accurate? Get real. \n \n Our biggest job is to keep Area 51's records organized. Every single planet containing intelligent civilizations is in our database. I've never actually met people from these planets, though. Again, those lucky bastards in 51 do that. We just make sure that their data stays in. And it's not just a name and a place. We know how they work, their intentions, and much more. I've read through a couple, but you'd be surprised, and frightened, at the number of entries. \n \n I guess I am lucky, though. I do get to leave the base once in a while. Everyone thinks we are just a giant toolshed for the military. Meanwhile, those guys in 51 have n't seen sunlight in months, many of them years. We also get to stay up to date on current events. The guys in 51 would n't know the President if he came up to them and shook their hand. They could tell you the ambassador to the Kepler-438b, though. \n \n To think I went to college for six years for this. I want to quit, but once you leave, your memory is erased and you wake up thinking you've been a vacuum salesman for the last 15 years. I do n't want that, but I know it's inevitable. Once you retire, more of the same happens. Men in Black really is n't that far off. \n \n I'd love to expand on my experiences here in 52, but our base is going into lockdown mode. We have an extraterrestrial visitor coming, and they are referred to as the `` North Korea of the Milky Way''. Wish me luck. I hope they like the jello.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Today is the turning point in the war against the robots . Today , their batteries run out .\n","story":"**November 27th, 2457 AD** \n \n The world is a bleak place. Humans have long since been outed as the apex predator. That title belongs to the robots. The very machines we designed to fight our wars, to help out around the house, and even to teach our children. These heartless machines tuned against us many moons ago. Take a seat, and let me tell you about the fall of humanity, the rise of the machines, and their eventual downfall\u2026 \n \n \n **July 8th, 2453 AD \u2013 Iris** \n \n The day started like any other summer day, my fianc\u00e9e, Ren\u00e9e and I were talking a walk through the virtual park. Real parks no longer existed due to the overpopulation of earth demanding apartment complexes built into every corner of the globe. We were having a lovely time when suddenly a news banner covered our screens. *Breaking News! -The Janus Industries robots have fallen victim to a deadly virus that corrupts their software, turning them against humans. * \n \n The banner disappeared and everyone in the virtual park stood in awe of the message we had all just received. The shock didn \u2019 t last long before we were met with a new message from a female character who claimed to be Iris, the messenger of the gods. It claimed responsibility for the human-killing virus, explaining that we were a disease on earth and we had to be exterminated. It was at this moment that the human race was knocked clean off of our comfy little pedestal. We were no longer in charge of this planet, Iris was. \n \n I lost my fianc\u00e9e to the initial slaughter, along with my parents and one of my sisters. My second sister, Cassandra, and myself, Kyler, managed to escape into one of the early human strongholds. Many of these early fortresses were established in malls, schools, and other community centres. It was the easiest way to make sure other humans could find their way to them. They were a safe place-the only safe place at the time. However, that didn \u2019 t last long. \n \n \n **July 2453 to May 2454 \u2013 The Collapse** \n \n Many of these early strongholds fell within the month. The either fell victim to the onslaught of rogue machines, a fatal lack of resources, or typical human infighting. Our fortress in particular, a local mall, had a large enough military presence to survive the hordes of Iris machines and more than enough resources to keep us all alive. Our camp ran into the issue of power. \n \n At the beginning, we were led by the commanding officer of the present military. However, when the constant barrages of machines began to die off, we all began questioning if this General Mathias should really be in charge. My sister and I tried to keep our distance from this power struggle but we were eventually forced to choose a side. It was the people, versus Mathias and her battalion. She began enforcing martial law and rationing food. It wasn \u2019 t long before the people began rebelling. As the acts of rebellion increased in severity, it became increasingly harder for my sister and I to abstain from this civil war. \n \n It was midway through the winter when things had escalated into full on warfare. We were killing ourselves. The Mathias \u2019 s soldiers were smaller in number but had much more firepower. The Red Runners ( the name the rebels had given themselves ) had more manpower but far less guns, they had to get creative. Many crude explosives were made, and used on the reigning army. It was around this time that a small faction of us splintered off and tried to return attention to the robot threat. No one ever listened to us since the robots had not attacked in months. Little did we know, this was Iris \u2019 s plan all along. \n \n It was January 2nd, 2454 when all hell broke loose. The Red Runners had begun a full on assault on Mathias Manor ( the headquarters of Mathias \u2019 s army ). It was a blood bath. The splinter faction of pacifists had decided that now was our chance to make an exit. However, we were cut off by a flanking squadron of Mathias soldiers. Despite our claims of being a splinter faction, they would not believe us and they opened fire. I managed to get to cover, but my sister Cassandra was not so lucky. My last surviving family member, murdered in cold blood. \n \n I was about to charge the soldiers, blinded by rage, when an explosion rang out across the mall. It was Iris. She had waited for us to kill ourselves before she swooped in to finish us off. At his moment all civil disagreements were forgotten, the remaining splinter faction members and nearby soldiers decided it was more important to escape and we all fled together. We managed to escape the mall but it wasn \u2019 t long before we were at each other \u2019 s throats again. I was still grieving over the loss of Cassandra when I did it. I killed the remaining soldiers in their sleep. I wasn \u2019 t proud of what I had done, but I wasn \u2019 t going to stop myself. The few of us remained began wandering this new hell. In the span of nearly a year, humans had gone from overpopulating the earth at the top of the food chain to one of the scarcest creatures on this planet. We all suspected that it was the end of humanity but we were wrong. \n \n \n **September 26th, 2456 AD \u2013 A New Darkness** \n \n It wasn \u2019 t just the end of humanity; it was also the end of the world. These Iris robots began harvesting any remaining organic matter for what we all believed to be some sort of super weapon to eradicate all humans. This mass harvest had one side effect though: with the sever drop in plants and other organic matter, the pollution from human civilisation began to block out the sun. \n \n All of our factories kept running, filling the skies with their smog. The sun was blocked from touching this planet, but the trapped heat prevented a new ice age. Instead, it simply became eternal winter, and it was always dark out. We had to adapt and evolve to survive. The increased darkness helped us to hide from Iris, but the harsh cold made it difficult for us to survive, but we managed. We held it together in the face of death for no other reason than as humans we are far too stubborn to die. Our small group began to grow as we encountered new factions of humans. It was nice to see that we weren \u2019 t the only survivors. \n \n This new darkness carried with it, a vital secret: something that would turn the tables and carry the human race to victory over our own creations\u2026 \n \n \n **November 26th, 2457 AD \u2013 Batteries Not Included** \n \n It was over a year after the darkness had fallen upon the land and humans had adapted to hunt specific machines: harvesters. These were the machines gathering all of the biomass, much of it edible. They became our main source of nutrition. However, these hunts had become ever more difficult since Iris too was adapting. She began sending guardians with the harvesters to deter our attacks. Of course our need to survive pushed us to develop ways of taking down the guardians. I was on one such hunt when it happened: the tables had turned on this artificial bitch. \n \n We were hunting in the northern streets when the normal pack of harvesters approached. They were accompanied by their usual array of guards, but something was off. One harvester kept falling behind and it appeared to be moving awfully slow. Suddenly, it stopped moving altogether and collapsed. It \u2019 s batteries had run out. All of Iris \u2019 s surrounding minions began panicking. Iris had improved on the robots designs, but she hadn \u2019 t fundamentally changed them, or how they worked. The Janus robots were solar powered and simply had immense solar batteries for when there came a storm. Iris had overlooked this and the eternal darkness had finally begun taking its toll on the robots. It wasn \u2019 t long before they began to drop like flies. \n \n \n **November 27th, 2457 AD \u2013 This World of Ours** \n \n That brings us to today. The robots are dropping, and Iris can \u2019 t make the changes to her designs fast enough. We started our offensive by taking out her factories: we can \u2019 t have her remedying this issue, now can we? My battalion just took out the Gamma factory and were on our way to the gates of Iris, a final rally point before we took this bitch down. Who would have thought, that our last minute decision to convert to green energy before the apocalypse would be our saving grace. \n \n We have a chance to take Iris down, once and for all. We can start anew; we can rebuild this world, *but do it better. * \n \n EDIT: Formatting, you all know how it is...\n"}

Erde already had a million thoughts racing through his mind, but one stood out among all the others. Today was the day. On this day the elders would return from the Meeting, as they have every time a red moon comes about. Any villager who was able to make the journey to the Circle would do so. They would bring along the largest crabs in their stores with hopes of winning the favor of one of the elders. Once the elders chose the largest crab and crowned a victor, their wives would prepare the largest feast he had ever seen. Every time the elders returned from a meeting a feast was thrown, each larger than the last. Erde thought about this day every day since the last feast. While every other residents' home lay beside the Water, Erde's home, inherited from his father, put him closer to the middle of the Land than to the Water. \n \n Erde's home revolved around his orchard, the small hut sat beneath the towering fruit tree his fathers ancestors had planted centruies ago. His father had once grown the sweetest and sourest fruits in the Land, a single fruit could go for up to three crabs at the market. Now Erde grew the fruits his father had once laboured over, though Erde did not share his fathers passion. Erdes living situation left him unable to readily gather crabs. This left Erde with a choice, take the voyage to town and trade his fruits for some crab, or simply eat his fruits. An easy choice it may seem, but the journey to town is a grueling trek which at best would take an entire day, at worst he would be killed by one of the creatures in the woods. And his fruits did not have the flavor of those grown near the Water, so either choice would not leave him satisfied. So Erde stayed home, alone but for his dog and his fruits. He was not one to choose a rocky road when a smooth path lay a few steps away. So he stayed content with his fruits throughout his days, waiting for the feast. The feast gave him a reason to take up the journey to the town. On this day he could eat as much crab as he could, and not have to trade a single fruit. \n\n"}

Sea salt mingling with the aroma of the hotdog vendor on the boardwalk. Toes buried in sand as cool waves caress your legs and almost pull you away. Wind whipping around you as you soar down the highway on one of you `` once in a lifetime'' roadtrips. Cold icecream melting in mouths and radiant sunlight warming untanned skin. A gentle breeze rustling through the leaves of the tree you're reading under, green grass your chair, a running dog your momentary distraction. Beach volley tournaments and new friendships, icy drinks and 1.5 meals a day. Long days and warm nights spent embracing fleeting freedom. Sapphire skies and diamond stars. Warm rain bursting in one day and gone the next. Silence, the ocean your company as you sit there past sundown, and somewhere, further down the beach, a guitar is being strummed.\n"}

I said to the flippered onlookers, my former adherents to the Atlantean Sublime. `` We were all born with an original fin, and because you paid your tithes and advanced through the four stages of Antediluvian conversion, in your prior life, you're now in the real Atlantean Sublime! Is n't this great?'' \n \n `` This does n't look like any kinda sublime to me,'' said Martha, from Irvine CA, who I'd recruited personally after reading her husband's obit and telling her Frank, who was a marine biologist, had been a Bishop in the Atlantean Order, but had n't set up automatic payment on his tithes. `` And where is Frank?'' she added. \n \n The truth was, I had n't really thought through what the Atlantean Sublime would look like, aside from the original fin bit ( `` mistranslated from the early Greek exegists as'original sin' in an effort to discredit the Atlantean gospels'' ). So apparently, if you did n't have a robust conception of the afterlife it just defaulted to an endless white space for whatever details you had n't fleshed out. I was in a room with a few hundred men and women, some of whom I recognized and some not, but each who had one enormous flipper instead of legs. \n \n `` This is bullshit. And why do you have two legs? Why can you walk around?'' said Connor, from Dubuque, IA.

He did, though, have enough on hand to sign up for a Gold membership at $ 66 \/ month. He went hook line and sinker for the pre-flood tale. The subscription model was what had really kicked me into the big leagues. No more few hundred here and there on card tricks or other small time scores; you sign someone up for life, my banker friend explained to me, that's a net present value of like, ten thousand dollars. \n \n `` Because the Grand Patriarch of the Atlantean Sublime always retained his legs, in all the images of me I always had two legs, remember?'' I said. \n \n But now Patrick, the fucking backstabber, piped in. `` That's just because you were two lazy to add that flipper to your photo. I remember when you did n't want to pay Jorge to do the photoshop so you just printed the pamphlets without it.'' He slapped his giant fin angrily on the bare white surface, making a wettish smack. I'd given him a place in the administration. So ungrateful. \n \n `` That never happened,'' I said, glad that it did. I had two legs and they all had fins! They would never be able to catch me. \n \n `` and you said the flood would come, not that it had come yet, and it would restore the world to its former, antediluvian bliss,'' said some fat face, perched on its elbows, that I did n't recognize. \n \n `` Yeah, with the french fried plankton!'' said another face. \n \n The what? I thought. \n \n `` Yeah, the kind that has all the nutritional benefits of the paleo diet and increases mental clarity and it's free and abundant and all you have to do is open your mouth to inhale it!'' said another one. \n \n `` Yeah, where's the french fried plankton?'' \n \n `` What do I have this baleen in my mouth for if there's no french fried plankton?'' another said. \n \n `` It's for, uh, so that you do n't have to brush your teeth again ever!'' I said. \n \n `` How long did he say it would take the flood to come?'' someone asked. \n \n `` He said there would be a liminal state, right after our human death,'' said the fat face again, `` in which we could become comfortable in our new bodies.'' \n \n This must have been one of the sermons I gave when I was on drugs; I remembered none of this. \n \n `` He said the liminal state would be a Dry period, but it would be brief, and would be followed immediately by the currents of the sublime flood.'' \n \n `` And it would begin with a slow rumbling,'' someone said. \n \n I began to hear a rushing far off, the first noise besides voices in this place. \n \n `` And we would see the waters in the distance, but they would be real waters, the currents of the sublime, and they would grow and grow in sound.'' \n \n I turned my head, and in that white expanse I could see a dark wall, with what seemed to be white specks of foam at its top, and it was rushing towards us. I started to run away from it, back towards my flippered flock. \n \n `` And the adversary would be conquered,'' they all said, but I could barely hear them now, so powerful was the sound of the water. \n \n `` And in those waters would exist the Postdiluvian, the Atlantean divine,'' they all said, like a chant. This started to come back to me. \n \n `` And we'd eat french fried plankton!'' someone else said, as the deluge caught us all up, and in a swirl of confusion I watched the bubbles escaping from my nose and mouth, my body punched with all the disproportionate force of a tree hitting a grape, my legs kicking against the cataract helplessly, and I slowly lost consciousness as my followers swam off in eddies of postdiluvian joy.\n"}

The church had been cold, the kind of cold that would creep into your lungs and sit there, waiting for the chance to kill you when it could. Outside was n't much better. The wind blistered lips and wore down headstones like the vengeful scream of a banshee. At the very least, it was n't too far from the church to the groundskeeper's cabin. There he'd be able to warm himself by the iron stove. When he'd built the cabin with his father, they'd made sure to make the stove the main fixture of the place. A big fancy desk was of no use to anyone if your fingers fell off from the winter's bite. \n \n As he reached the door of the cabin - well, shed, really - he turned to stare at the graveyard. He'd spent the last twelve years tending the church, its yard, and the graveyard. This place was more home than home itself at this point, with the serene expanse of the yard interrupted by flat marble slabs popping up like odd flowers. He turned back to the door, fumbling with his keys, when he heard a jingle that was too sonorous to be his keyring. Ice flowed through his veins and a glacial fear swept over him, crushing him, obliterating his comfort. \n \n He stood, listening, every branch rustle, every snow fall, magnified to the crash and roar of a thousand cannons. He had known that sound. When he sniffled, the noise made him jump. He found himself staring at the field of graves, fixed in place. Empty. Nobody to be seen. His teeth chattered. \n \n *ring. * \n \n *ring-a-ding. * \n \n *ring. * \n \n He saw it this time. On the far end of the graveyard, where the newer graves were. Movement. Noisy movement. Thomas closed his eyes and prayed that he had n't seen it move, but it had. The bell by the side of the headstone had jiggled back and forth. He threw the door to the cabin open, and grabbed his father's old shovel. The wood was dry, and the blade was rusted, but as long as Thomas had remembered, it had always been that way, so it stayed that way. \n \n *ring. * \n \n *ring-a-ding. * \n \n *ring. * \n \n He sprinted through the yard, legs pumping, feet thundering. He got to the grave where the bell had rung.

He labored, and the bell rang. \n \n When he finally heard the *THUNK* of his shovel blade hitting wood, the ringing ceased. He cleared the dirt off and opened the casket. Lonely bones stared up at him. He blinked, unable to find words, or thoughts. As he tried to move around the casket to inspect the remains, he felt his foot slip, and he slammed his head into the handle of the hinged lid, falling into the casket as it slammed shut. \n \n When the sun came up, the dirt in the freshly filled grave had not yet begun to freeze, and someone had brought flowers. The melting snow sloughed off the headstone, which read `` Elizabeth Jacobs, born July 12th of 1867, died Oct 22nd of 1871, Taken Before Her Time.''

I even tried underground Warlocks, transferring magic from prisoners. Incredibly illegal. Nothing worked. \n \n I chewed on a loaf of bread that Mom had made. Most magicians in the mornings eat soup, a specific kind to open their mind to new magics. Not me, because it was entirely useless. I talked to some of my friends, mostly weak magicians because popularity was determined by power. Locke, one of the louder ones, was actually powerful. In my opinion, he could rival my sister.

Instead of a blaring of out out place noise and beeps, I am greeted with great life to fuel my day. Well, I better figure out where I am first. The window of a rather ordinary house reveals that it may not be so ordinary. Chrome covers every single wall and face of the buildings surrounding me. It reflects in every directing, with sleek architecture and perfect, yet jagged designs. All the bright colors were like notes of music in my eye, especially compared to where I was yesterday. Every time it was different, but my worlds I live in have never been so bright and amazing as today.

Google has self-driving cars, could it be too far-fetched of an idea that no one was in there? I cast the thought to the back of my mind. A silver door, glowing with the light of the sun opens up, and I enter into the massive fortress. Nothing. Well, metal and windows, I guess. A light flickers on, and the room comes alive. Hundreds of buttons appear around the room, but no labels. I push one, and more light up. The entire room shakes, and a few specks of dust scatter. It lifted up! The entire room begins to rise, and I start to see the sky. The sky is distinctively perfect. \n \n ___ \n \n *La Lune* \n \n Actually, this is too perfect. Something about the sky, just feels off. I'm standing in a fishbowl. No, really, I can see the curvature and the edges of the world. And those clouds, the shapes are reappearing. There are only 3 or 4 big fluffy shapes of clouds in the sky. I watch from the top of the building. It's a loop. The clouds are traveling to the left of where I'm standing, and there's a kind of rhythm to it. It just does n't feel the same as anything else I've ever seen. I push a couple more buttons. Some do nothing as far I can tell. Some make small noises, and some control this giant elevator room. One green light turned another light green, which turned another one green and so on. I ran around the room in a skip, playing the'game' of turning all the buttons to a color until there was only one left.

His jaw agape, he did n't know what to say. \n \n The next one the old man stopped in front of repeated the process, but nothing happened. No gift. So I was n't guaranteed to have a gift. Still, the thought was giving rise to butterflies in my stomach. If I had magic, what would I be able to do? \n \n Finally, the old man stopped in front of me. He raised an expectant eyebrow but said nothing. Taking the hint, I raised my hand above my head. \n \n As the old man reached out to poke my chest, I closed my eyes. \n \n I heard gasps from the others as I felt something fall onto my hand and head. I opened my eyes in alarm and shook my hand. A white powder of some kind was all over my hand -- and probably in my hair. \n \n The old man frowned. `` Is that... another budding fire gift?

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The orbit around Earth suddenly fills with thousands of alien ships . Turns out the moon has just been made a stop in a galactic game similar to Pokemon Go .\n","story":"`` So, you all are n't playing?'' he asked, kind of incredulously. It was a little weird, that they looked so human, but we learned the intelligent designers were kind of right all along - little nanobots had been guiding the evolution of millions of planets around the galaxy so we'd all basically be the same. Except for the third nostril, which somehow this guy's planet had a freak mutation cause. Turns out Star Trek was right too, for the most part aliens are just humans with a piece of plastic or antenna on their head, or sometimes blue skin. \n \n But that's what we'd learned. Gil was sitting across from me at the table. He had some kind of phone shaped things ( `` something something quantum something'' ) which apparnetly enabled near instantaneous communication to a server back home, and apparently our moon was a hot spot. So suddenly we're not alone, we've got thousands of visitors, and they love - absolutely love - earth coffee. So now they're parking ships over our cities, and dashing down for coffee. \n \n We're trying to figure out what their politics are or how the universe works, but everytime we try they just mumbled something and go back to their phones, playing the damn game. We still do n't even know how their ships work - and neither do they, apparently. One alien wanted to talk to us all about how her ship worked, so she let one of our engineers in, and then she just showed him how to turn it on and make it go. None of them have any knowledge of how their tech works - they're basically kids and people with free time playing a game. We managed to `` pop the hood'' on one vehicle, and could n't even begin to sort out what was going on - imagine giving a cave man a computer and no support. We've learned nothing. And the moon will dry up as a hot spot in a few weeks, and they'll likely be gone forever. \n \n So, this will go down as an interesting foot note in history. On the plus side, I've gotten some cool alien currency selling coffee. And who knows, maybe it will be good enough to bring them back.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Someone you care about has died . Unable to cope with the loss , you travel to the afterlife to bring them back .\n","story":"The gash on my hand ached, blood dripping as I finished drawing the pentagram on the floor. Lighting a candle at each point I stand up to admire my handiwork. Satisfied, I bandage my hand and grab the backpack I had prepared. I turn back to the circle, taking a deep breath I speak the hellish words. \n \n `` By the backwards legal practices, fine print, and bewildering bureaucracy, I call to thee!'' \n \n A silent chill spreads over the room as I wait with baited breath, expecting the worst. Nothing happens. I sigh, I was such a fool for thinking this would actually work. Guess it's back to the drawing board. \n \n Suddenly, the candles dim and the dried blood on the floor begins to glow deep red. A swirl of fire appears in the center and a figure emerges. I'm briefly taken aback as I did n't expect a demon to look so\u2026 mundane. The figure stands no taller than I and wears a well-tailored business suit. If it was n't for the crimson skin, short horns, and faint smell of brimstone he would n't look out of the ordinary at walking to work in NYC. He turns to me with a chilling smile, the kind you get from a serial killer or a used car salesman. \n \n `` So'' he says, that disgusting smile still plastered upon his lips. `` Let me guess, you want to make a deal''. \n \n I just stare at the demon, still unable to formulate a coherent sentence. After a moment I manage to stammer out `` You\u2026 are n't exactly what I expected. I thought you would look and sound more\u2026 evil''. \n \n The demon groans squeezing the bridge of his nose in annoyance. `` Yes, that seems to be what you mortals always say. Hell is n't exactly what you expect but that is beside the point. Do you wish to make an offer or not?'' \n \n `` Well\u2026 now that I think about it\u2026 I think I'm going to have to reconsider'' With a protracted sigh the demon looks at his watch. `` Well, next time you call on the denizens of hell please make sure you've actually made up your mind. Until then, I am very busy.'' \n \n I tense up as the demon motions to snap his fingers. As flames rapidly encircle the demon I dive forward, grabbing him and the fire consumes us both. \n \n -- - \n \n I expected the smell of sulfur, oppressive heat, the screams of the dammed, or *something* stereotypical. Instead, I find myself subjected to far worse; the painful florescent lighting, cranked up air conditioning, and banal unobtrusive music of an office building. I glance around the cubicle I have found myself in. Knick-knacks, a picture of the river Styx, a computer running Vista, and a phone ripped straight out of the 70's adorn a cubicle desk. Glancing out into the hallway, I see more cubicles stretching as far as the eye can see. \n \n `` Ok asshole, what the heck are you doing?!'' \n \n I snap out of my curious trance and look at the demon next to me. `` Sorry\u2026'' I glance down at the name plate at the edge of his cubicle `` Craig'' I add, barely managing to restrain my laughter. `` I needed to get here and figured I could hitch a ride. Looks like I was right. I add looking around once more''. \n \n `` Why did n't you just come in the normal way? It's not like it's difficult'' Craig says glaring at me. \n \n `` Because I'm only here to visit, do n't you get tourists down here?'' \n \n Craig responds with a look of utter confusion. `` You know where you are right? You should be on your knees begging me to take you back not casually sightseeing!'' \n \n `` You're probably right, but first off this is n't exactly the hell of myth. Instead of fire there's admittedly slightly uncomfortable A\/C, and instead of the screams of the dammed there is\u2026'' I cock my head to the side and listen for a moment. `` Celine Dion? Besides, I'm not here under the usual circumstances'' \n Craig sits down in the swivel chair behind him and puts his face in his hands `` Why me?'' he asks, exasperated. With a sigh, he looks back up at me. `` So then why are you here?'' `` I'm here to pick up a friend. She ended up here prematurely and I'm going to bring her back.'' \n \n `` And what, you expect everyone to just let the two of you walk out?'' \n `` Well no, but I'll figure something out. Saaaaaaaay, why do n't you help me out? It would be a great way to stick it to your boss! Come on, it'll be fun!'' Craig redoubles his disapproving glare. `` Not a chance, I'm behind on work anyway.'' `` Fine, can you at least tell me where I can find information on new arrivals?'' \n With a devious smile Craig points down the hall. `` It's about 10 miles that way. Do tell me if you succeed in your stupid plan. I'd hate to see your soul get crushed by this place.'' With that, he hands me a business card and turns back to his computer. \n \n I shrug and tighten the straps on my pack. Just before I leave I pause `` Oh, and I was meaning to ask. What's with the suits and cubicles? Should n't there be less casual Friday's and more torture going on here?'' Without looking up from his computer Craig responds. `` That's just what the big man downstairs calls'brand image'. The whole eternal torment thing is really just to keep the real preachy people out''. \n \n I was told ten miles, but it felt like ten thousand as I hurried past the endless rows of cubicles. Every step I was astonished at how these denizens of hell failed to be even the slightest bit intimidating. Demons of all shapes and sizes with all manner of unnatural features were dressed in business casual and crammed into regulation sized cubicles. It was kind of sad. The further I walked, the more eternal torment in fiery pits did n't seem like such a terrible fate. \n \n Eventually, a door came into view with the word `` Admissions'' emblazoned above in letters seemingly made of pure fire\u2026 using Times New Roman font. How they managed to make burning letters seem so banal is beyond me. I open the door and enter a large waiting room. Despite it being entirely devoid of life I almost walk into a small sign saying `` please take a number''. With a shrug I grab a small slip of paper and take a seat. `` Six hundred and sixty six, of course'' I mutter to myself. Looking up I see a small screen that says they're serving number i. \n \n `` What would I expect from hell?'' I ask no one and stand up. I march up to the desk and look for whoever is working. Several stations down there is an individual with the head of a goat looking back at me with those unsettling rectangular pupils. `` Hello sir, how can I help you today?'' he drones. `` Hi yes, I'm looking for somebody. Her name is Sarah Black, she arrived on the first of June Earth time.'' \n \n `` Do you have her celestial identification number?'' \n \n `` Her what? No, ca n't you just look her up?'' The goat-headed individual looks at me pointedly for a moment. `` Sir, we must follow protocol, if you do n't have the information we need I simply can not find the individual you seek.'' \n \n I open my mouth to respond and close it again. Hell is a bureaucratic nightmare, of course, why would n't it be? I walk away from the station and down the incredibly long desk, looking around for anyone else in this room. Satisfied that nobody was watching I hop the desk and attempt to log on to one of the computers. Fortunately, demons are n't any better than humans when it comes to passwords. `` I'll give them one thing, they keep impeccable records. Thank goodness I learned to use Microsoft access'' I add under my breath as I scroll through the list. Sure enough, there she was, cause of death rabid wolverines, location, the ninth circle\u2026 wow executive treatment. \n \n I rush out and ask the infinitely useful clerk `` which way to the elevator?'' He simply points and goes back to doing something that I'm sure is of the utmost importance. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, the elevator arrives. I shuffle in next to several demons and press button number nine. I eye my companions as the elevator doors close. One of them is going to fart, I just know it. \n \n -- - \n \n [ Continued below, I hit the character limit ]\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a disgruntled super hero who hates his job\n","story":"Its not often I get downtown to enjoy a sandwich at Cardona \u2019 s. The place is a dump, but the pastrami on rye is to die for. Easily the best and town and my favorite thing to eat in this world. The place being a dump works out good for me to, because it keeps people away so I don \u2019 t get bothered too much. Even on days when it was busier, like today, it still wasn \u2019 t too bad. I just enjoyed my pastrami and pretended to be seriously invested in what was playing on the television behind the bar. Unfortunately it was usually professional bowling, but I figured fuck it. I \u2019 d rather feign interest in that bullshit than have deal with some stupid ass kid. Its not that I hated kids, but when you \u2019 re in my line of work the constant nagging and pointless statements get old real quick. Santa only gets it one month out of the year, How I envy that fat bastard. \n Anyway, back to my sandwich, three bites in and I was in culinary heaven. Cardona \u2019 s pastrami was like a nuclear explosion of flavor in your mouth. I remembered back to the time when I had to stop a nuke from being dropped on Manhattan. What a pain in the ass that was. I still get letters from ungrateful bastards that I threw it into Montana. Why was it an issue? What the hell is even in Montana. My fourth bite was rudely interrupted by the sound of the channel being switched. It stopped on CNN, \u2018 Breaking News \u2019 scrolled across the screen. The urgency in the reporter \u2019 s voice told me it was something serious. \n \n Don \u2019 t read it. Don \u2019 t rea- \n I read it. \n \u2018 Lunatic in tank terrorizing Westside highway \u2019 was currently the headline flashing on the screen. God damnit, I thought to myself. Every day, every fucking day its something else with these assholes. Shit hits the fan and they expect me to be there to clean it up. Not today, let the guys who are actually paid to deal with this crap do something. I took another bite. See, the thing with Cardona \u2019 s is they let their pastrami soak for like 3 weeks. God damn brilliant. The lady at the table next to me was giving me a sideways glance. I ignored it, but I could feel her eyes on me. I gave in and locked eyes with her. My apathy must have been pretty apparent, she shook her head disapprovingly and turned away. She motioned to whisper the fellow woman sitting across from her. I laughed. \n \u201c You know I \u2019 ll be able to hear anything you say, right. \u201d I mockingly laughed at her and continued my pastrami feast. Her and her friend stood up. \n \u201c You should be ashamed of yourself! \u201d They hurried out of the restaurant, shaking their heads. Suddenly all the eyes in Cardona \u2019 s were on me, I could feel them judging. I looked down at my half eaten sandwich, defeated. I threw my napkin down, stomping towards the door. \n \u201c Do you know what its like to never have a day off!? I don \u2019 t enjoy this shit! \u201d I stomped back to the table and grabbed the rest of my sandwich. \u201c I \u2019 m finishing this! \u201c \n \n It wasn \u2019 t long before I found the tank and its path of destruction. I hovered above it momentarily, taking another bite of my sandwich as I decided how to handle the situation. The tank stopped and started turning the main canon at me. Great, I thought, they must be listening to the radios. The barrel started to rise until it was pointed directly at me. I laughed disbelievingly, they couldn \u2019 t be serious. A thunderous bang rung out as they fired. I let the projectile hit me. Give those sonofabitch news channels what they want. That \u2019 s when I realized my hand was empty\u2026 The blast must have ripped my pastrami sandwich from my grasp. In a blind rage I flew down, they fired a another shot, but I punched it into the bay. I grabbed the barrel of the gun and started to spin in circles before releasing the tank at least a mile into the ocean. All I wanted to do was enjoy my sandwich, Was that too much to ask. \n\n"}

Valiantly he returned to his paperback, burying his nose in the cheap legal thriller to undermine this new reality of winking dragons. \n \n His doctor had warned him this might happen, but could have stood to tell him just how vivid they would be. This was a step above the gremlin in his suitcase, or even that lumbering ogre in the airport who in retrospect may have been a very real, very unfortunate man with a gland thing. But perhaps that was just wishful thinking on Percy's part, just as valid as thinking the mythical lizard over the right wing was a newfangled weather balloon. \n \n Enthralling as it was, not even the poorly-written epic of Tom Brigs, Esq. could distract Percy from the sudden shaking that rocked the plane, setting loose a low wave of murmuring that spread through Business Class. The captain wasted no time in quelling the tide, his voice crackling through the shitty airplane speakers. `` Just a patch of turbulence folks, nothing to worry about.'' \n \n Risking the window again, Percy looked out to behold the dragon resting on one wing of the plane.

Get your ass on the ground!'' I hear from my right. I look over, it's Will. I did n't recognize his voice in the heat of the gun battle. I instinctively dropped to the ground and crawled behind a knocked over receptionist desk. The cop's bullets whizzed over my head, making sickening sounds as they collided with the walls and broke the marble floor on impact. I peeked over my stronghold and fired at the cops positioned across the room. Two shots. Two bullets. Two cops on the ground dead. I was the best shot in the game, my precise aim and infamous trigger finger were both unrivaled. A bullet caught my shoulder as I was reloading my gun, and I turned to look at the shooter. The last three policeman were circling behind me in hopes to finish me off. Those hopes did n't last long. *BANG! BANG! BANG! * Seventeen if Atlanta, Georgia's finest lay dead on the ground. \n \n I went to pick up the bags of money from the corner, stepping over dead bodies as if they were twigs on the sidewalk. My fellow criminals were in the getaway car, all the cameras were shot out. I thought about taking my mask off. I decided against it. I picked up the over-stuffed duffel bag and slung it over my shoulder. Walking towards the door, I start to hear crying from the other side of the room. I decided to investigate the noise and strutted to a supply closet in the hallway. When the door was opened there was a lady inside, one who definitely did n't work here. She was wearing a short pleated skirt and a crop-top, with a black and gray flannel shirt over it, along with a classic black choker and white faux-diamond studded sandals. Her long dyed-lavender hair spilled over her shoulders and into her gray-blue eyes, covering up half of her pink and white thick rimmed glasses. She was drop dead gorgeous. \n \n `` W-who are you? Are you g- gon na kill me too? G-go ahead. Do your worst.'' Her steely eyes looked deep into my soul and her lips spread into a confident smirk. \n \n `` Gladly.'' I responded, and put my gun to her head. I saw her gaze soften for a bit, a flicker of fear running through her face. I was faced with a terrible truth: \n \n I was deeply attracted to this women. \n \n I could n't bring myself to pull the trigger, I felt the need to protect her. I tried to think of a way to spare her without getting ratted out to the cops. The getaway driver started blowing the horn at me. Just then ann idea popped into my head. \n \n `` Get up.'' I barked. \n \n `` What?'' She blinked, confused as to why she was n't dead. \n \n `` I said get up. And follow me. We're going to the car, and if you say one word I swear to *God* that I splatter your brain all over the fucking sidewalk.'' I forcefully yanked her to her feet, realizing then how short she was compared to me, maybe standing 5'2'' whereas I am 5'9''. I always thought short people were more attractive. This was not going well for me. \n \n We walked out the car and I shoved her into the backseat with me. I got in behind her and shut the door. \n \n `` What the hell Monica!? We did n't agree to take prisoners.'' Will yelled when he saw her. \n \n `` Shut up Will. When we get back to base we split the money and go seperate ways. You never have to see this girl again. She'll be my problem.'' I responded story. He did n't bother to argue. It was a three hour drive back to base and we did n't want to spend it arguing. \n \n About an hour into the drive I look over at the girl. For the first time I notice a tattoo on her shoulder. `` What kinda ink you got, lady?'' I ask her. \n \n `` Oh. It's uh... well... It's nothing. Not important.'' She said back. \n \n I grabbed her flannel, and pulled her towards me `` I said: what kind of tattoo do you have? Bitch.'' \n \n She removed her flannel to reveal a rainbow flag and The word'Proud'. I had abducted a beautiful gay chick. Today was not going my way. \n \n `` So... what's your name?'' I ask. \n \n `` Oh... Sonia. Sonia Lynn Taylor. What's yours?'' Sonia shot back. \n \n Without thinking I answered `` Monica Skylar Reese.'' I just gave this girl my full name. God I was having an off day. Why was this girl so hot!? Why was I so into her!? That was another issue I'd have to confront. \n \n After Sonia and I spent the rest of the drive making small talk, we got to my place. I split the money with Will and told him goodbye. I brought the girl into my room and decided to go for it. I went to the bathroom and changed into casual clothes. Then came back into the room to see her still sitting on my bed. \n \n `` So... you're gay?'' I asked, hoping I did n't sound insensitive. \n \n `` Yeah... you're pretty cute, y'know?'' She answered. I hoped she was being serious, but chances are she was trying to flatter her way to freedom. \n \n `` Well, I just so happen to be gay too. Lucky day for both of us, I guess. Now here's the deal. Do you actually, honestly think I'm cute?'' I ask excitedly. \n \n `` Yeah, I mean... you're decent. I'd date you if you were n't a criminal.'' \n \n `` And if I were to *stop* being a criminal??'' \n \n `` Then maybe we could talk.'' \n \n `` Okay then. I'd like to formally apologize for kidnapping you. You may go. On one condition. Please, do n't tell anyone about this. For all intents and purposes I intend to stop my life of crime starting now.'' \n \n `` Really!? You're letting me go!? Oh my God! I wo n't tell anyone I swear!'' She smiled as she started to leave. \n \n `` Wait!'' I yelled as she walked out the door. \n \n `` Yeah?'' \n \n `` Wan na... go out to dinner with me one night? Maybe tomorrow?'' \n \n She smiled, `` Sure.'' \n \n We exchanged numbers and she left. \n \n Because I was never caught for anything, I never had a legal criminal record. So we lived happily ever after. \n \n When I met her parents I told them we met at the bank one day, and that she was absolutely captivated by my charm.

We needed someone who would balance out the infighting and territorial claiming amongst the council so we can focus on the up and coming crisis.'' \n \n Sutton raised his eyebrow. `` Crisis?'' \n \n `` Yeah, it's about Satan again, but my angels have informed me he's formed some kind of business deal with a couple of Zeus's disgruntled family members.'' \n \n `` Who?'' \n \n `` Hephestus, Eris, and few others. I guess they're planning on getting the \n Four horsemen back together for one last show, or so my little Cherubs have told me.'' \n \n `` Ugh, great... `` \n \n `` But listen, I'll fill you in at the next conference... When you attend. You're on the panel again. Apparently, you were a hit with the online polls. Sadly, the only good thing to come out of that panel. The mortals seem to like your straight-forward attitude. We need that kind of publicity, in these dark times. `` \n \n `` Whoa, whoa, whoa, I told you im not interested in this gig anymore. I'm not going to do it. Im just not.'' \n \n `` Sutton, please... \n \n `` No, there is nothing you csn say or do that will get me there.'' \n _________________________________________________________ \n Sutton adjusted his microphone and looked over at Jesus, with an extremely annoyed expression. To his left sat Buddha who had be reinvited, Athena, The leading elder from one of the most honorable Kani from the Japanese spiritual clans and last but, certainly not least, Shiva. \n \n `` I will always hate you for forcing me here, Jesus. `` \n \n Jesus laughed. `` No, you wo n't. Nobody ever hates me.'' \n \n Sutton grumbled, but knew JC was right. He was a nice guy who was impossible to hate. But it didnt matter now all eyes were on them as the conference started. \n \n `` Ah, yes, first question'' Athena started kicked the conference off with her usual confidence. \n \n A man in a gray suit with a rather tacky tie stood up and began asking a question. \n \n `` Athena this is for you. Given the recent nomination of Hillary Clinton as the first possible female president of the U. S. how can the public be sure you wont personally intervene to rig the election for her as you yourself are a woman in power? `` \n \n Athena looked stunned as did the rest of the panel. \n \n `` Why, I never.... I would never... Just who do you... `` \n \n Athena narrowed her eyes and snorted. \n \n `` Kritikos!?? Is that you?'' \n \n The reporter waved sheepishly with a devioua grin. `` Hey Fam!!!'' \n \n Sutton leaned over to Jesus `` Who is that?'' \n \n `` A relative of Athenas. He can be rather... Dificult'' \n \n `` Oooh boy.'' Sutton said as he looked over at an increasingly angrier Athens `` This night is going to get interesting...'' \n \n Shiva gulped... `` Indeed'' \n \n Sutton stabbed his fork into the prime rib on his plate. `` Well at least we have decent catering this time'' \n \n Jesus sighed and took a bite of steak. \n \n \n -- -- -- -- - \n \n TO BE CONT....? \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Shakespeare is resurrected in the 21st century . Trying to adapt to the new world 's culture , he rewrites one of his most famous plays , Romeo and Juliet , as a modern love story .\n","story":"`` Okay... Thank you for your time and effort, but the management decided not to publish your work. Not me, it's the higher-ups.'' It was the usual stock quote Dan used often to avoid quarrel with delusional writers. Dan leaned forward and offered handshake, but the writer gazed at what seemed to be an empty space which Dan happened to be occupying. \n \n The writer, sitting across the table, made no effort to hide his disappointment and bitterness. His face was turning purple, a bit of red from anger, and a bit of blue from shock. Then, his head fell all of the sudden as if he'd been hit by a swing of sledge hammer. As the Editor of mediocre publisher, Dan have seen a lot of writers in shock, anger, and denial, but this writer struck very peculiar. \n \n After about a minute of silence, the writer noticed the hand still hanging in front of him offering handshake. Then, the writer fixed his posture, and asked `` May I ask the reason why?'' \n \n Shit, Dan thought to himself. It's these type of guys. There goes my fucking day, Dan thought. Dan observed the writer -- he seemed to be a bit too old for the nagging delusional artist type of the writer. Some mustaches and beard with large forehead from balding. But Dan decided to give the usual treatment. Hit them hard, fast, and then be gone. \n \n `` Well, look. I've also read it too, but the level of your writing is subpar. Your English is a bit too formal and somewhat difficult to read, and your story is basically a rip off of Romeo and Juliet. None of the editors and managers I consulted with ( although Dan has not ) agreed that your book wo n't sell.'' \n \n Here, cold hard criticisms right at your gut, thought Dan. Dan studied the writer's face and saw a sign of mortification. Then, the writer said, `` But I wrote it.'' \n \n `` Yes, yes, I know that you wrote it. And we do n't like it too much.'' \n \n `` No, no, no. Not this one. Romeo and Juliet. I wrote it.'' \n \n `` Excuse me?'' Dan nearly shouted at the nonsense the writer just said. `` You're saying you're the Bard, William Shakespeare?'' Then Dan proceeded to take a sip of his empty cup of coffee, just to make a little obstruction between him and the writer. Dan wanted no more business with this delusional lunatic. \n \n `` Why, yes I am. I am William Shakespeare, from centuries ago. Only recently I was resurrected by Native American Shamans, who summoned me from the dark that is the afterlife in order to help his son's homework. I obliged, and in return, I was given a second life at Earth. Here I roam again.'' \n \n If it were his office, Dan would have called a security to escort the writer babbling nonsense. But the location of the meeting was at the cafe across the street from his office. Dan just wanted to get up, turn around, and leave. But he knew well this lunatic would n't let go of him. \n \n `` Well, do you have any evidence that you're indeed William Shakespeare?'' \n \n `` Yes! Yes I do! I can tell you the history of my life-Miranda was the Secret Queen of England! Only I would hold such information.'' \n \n Dan sighed, buried his face under his palms, and asked God what he could have done to deserve this. The writer, claiming to be none other than William Shakespeare himself, began a long story about how he was expecting to be praised for the contribution to English literature he has made.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A goldfish in a bowl that is present in a room where a married couple on the verge of divorce is having their last argument before they are divorced .\n","story":"The people were moving and yelling. He did n't care. He was on the verge of something. \n \n During all his life, he had moved around a liquid medium. And everything around him looked like it should. The castle was a castle, the algae were algae and the gravel was gravel. When he touched every corner in his domain, nothing seemed different. But the outer world, that beyond his domain, did n't look at all like his home. \n \n At first he had thought that the rest of the world was weird like that, with shapes that changed and moved. It was an horror. But once, a face had appeared near the hard limit to his bubble of water. And so, he stopped sleeping inside the castle, trying to understand the shape of the figures. \n \n He started trying to understand the way the world worked. At first, he modeled the world inside his domain, as it was closer at hand. At mouth. And it was relatively easy. But the shapes outside had to correspond to objects on the outside, so after seeing the face he started trying to see if there was a way that a shape could be deformed beyond comprehension if outside his domain. \n \n But first, he had to understand why objects seemed to have different colors and luminosities. He called this phenomena `` light'', and he added it to his model as some kind of rays that irradiated from some objects and were reflected by others. He thought that color was n't an innate property of objects themselves, but that it was given by light. Otherwise, it would n't make sense for the world to turn dark once The Great Light Machine turned off. \n \n But if these rays were instant, the shapes on the outside should n't be deformed. And then, the face he had once seen should n't have become a smudge of pink and oranges. So he gave the rays a velocity, which he called `` c''. \n \n And now he was starting to think: If light had a limit velocity, which was the maximum it could go, could it go slower? \n \n And he was now thinking: If light could go slower, then its path could be diverged. But if so, what would it matter? He still could n't predict the path a ray of light could take. \n \n Unless... \n \n Maybe... \n \n There was some noise. He tried to filter it off. Surely, the noise could also be deformed, maybe there were some sound rays in the same manner that light rays were. Maybe they were two expressions of the same phenomenon. Could it be...? \n \n If the light hit his domain at an angle... Assuming it's a perfectly even surface... Take the roof, for example... \n \n More noise. Damn it. He tried harder. He went to his castle and started thinking. \n \n If it got diverted by an angle, then it'd mean... \n \n Even more noise. Damn. Did the feeding animal ever shut up? He was trying to understand the secrets of the universe here, damn it! \n \n Now, if the same happened in a surface like his wall, it'd need to come tangentially to be undeformed, would it? But then what came from other sides would be deformed in other ways. How? \n \n Even more noise. It was getting harder to concentrate. \n \n Maybe the limits to his domain deformed light beyond what his medium itself deformed it. Maybe that's why the surface looked different from the rest... \n \n He started taking pebbles from the gravel, trying to note down some details of the model he was making. \n \n Or was it probable that light described curved paths? No, that would n't make sense. It'd need more things to explain the same phenomena, like a reason why the light on his roof would be differently deformed than the one on his walls. \n \n And now the low-pitched noise was raising and annoying him some more. Damn! Would n't the feeding servant ever shut up?! He was trying to do science here! \n \n No, wait, maybe it meant that light, curved or not, would travel differently because of his wall, and if it was curved then the parts below his wall, on the outside, would have paths that could n't be predicted unless one was in there... \n \n But then, how could he know if the light from the roof was more or less correspondent with the outside? Maybe the light source was'below' him, or could it be...? \n \n There had to be a relation between the speed of the light in his medium and the outside, but mayb -- The noise was unbearable. \n \n Maybe... \n \n He swept the pebbles with his tail in frustration. Would the humans ever shut the fuck up?\n"}
{"prompt":"[ EU ] ( Yu-Gi-Oh ! ) At the climax of the second Cold War , Obama and Putin face off with their America\/Russia themed decks .\n","story":"Obama had played his hand perfectly, he had used the trap card'Ukranian Air Disaster' dealing 2000 points directly to Putin's life. \n Putin had had the upper hand all game, his defensive machine card'The Iron Curtain' had been blocking all of his attacks with it's 4000 DEF. His KGB agent card had been picking off his key card with it's flip effect, allowing it to destroy one of Obama's monster cards and send it to the graveyard immediately. \n \n Obama, however, had a plan. Using his magic card'Israeli Distraction' he could summon a powerful defensive card called the'Iron Dome' straight from his deck. Once he switched it to attack position it activated the effect'PR Misdirection' forcing all incoming attack to attack his Iron Dome card. Whilst this took effect, Obama planned to lay a card face down. Obama knew this was risky but it was the only way to save his life points from being destroyed in 3 turns. He placed the magic card down, summoning'Iron Dome' to the field in defense position. \n \n Putin saw the Iron Dome card on the field and winced. He knew it's effect and he knew next turn Obama would force his monster cards to attack it instead of other key targets. Putin had no magic cards in his deck, instead relying on a trap and monster based strategy. Putin had a single card in his hand, he placed it face down on the field next to his two already active cards - The Iron Curtain and his KGB agent. \n \n Obama drew a card. He had drawn the magic card'Fox News Democratic Takeover', a powerful tool when used in the right circumstances. It allowed him to bolster the attack and defense of a singular card by 900 for one turn only due to a surge of public support. Obama had only his Iron Dome on the field right now but he had one more trap card to place face down. It could prove to be the key mechanism in the coming turns to take down Putin's Iron Curtain; the card was'Ukranian Revolution'. This card negated the magic effect of one monster card while it was face up on the field, Obama knew Putin did not favour magic cards and would be unlikely to be able to stop the effect of it. To end his turn he switched Iron Dome to attack position, activating the magic effect'PR Misdirection', and set his magic card'Fox News Democratic Takeover' down on the field - boosting the attack and defense of the Iron Dome to 3200\/4000. \n \n Putin began to sweat, the next card would determine if he could win the game. Putin placed his hand to his chest and drew. \n \n'Bear Rider Putin' \n \n He looked blankly at the card. He sank into his seat. The card was a small monster card which could combine with the magic card'Russian Viral Campaign' to become a fairly powerful foe in the early turns. As it stood he drew a monster card with 300 ATK and 600 DEF. He woefully placed it face down in attack position. Putin had no monsters that could attack and destroy the Iron Dome this turn and he had only 500 life points remaining. He activated his trap card that he placed face down the previous turn,'Russian Dashcam Videos', dealing 400 points of damage to Obama's life points and forcing him to send his hand to the graveyard. This would have been useful but Obama had no card in his hand, Putin hung his head in resignation. \n \n Obama drew a card and smiled. He had drawn'International Sanctions' allowing one of his monster to attack Putin's life points directly. He activated'Ukranian Revolution' and negated the effect of Putin's'Iron Curtain' forcing it into attack position. He then used his Iron Dome to attack Putin directly, putting his life points to 0. \n \n Sirens blasted, screams echoed, holograms faded. \n \n Putin was drawn away from the stage, his head still hung in sorrow, as Obama was paraded onto the main stage. \n \n He smiled.\n"}

The shorter man shuffled his feet, nervously pushing his square glasses up the bridge of his nose. The Colonel stood ramrod straight, arms held precisely behind his back. He glanced down briefly at the dossier in front of him. *Classified - Codename: Beige* He nodded swiftly. The shorter man bent to the mic in front of him. \n `` This is head scientist Boyle. Send in the subject.'' \n \n Through the glass pane was a sterile white room. In the center was a nondescript wooden table and two chairs. Either side of the room were two white automatic doors. After a few moments, the left one slid open. \n \n A man walked in slowly, blinking slightly in the harsh white light. He wore khaki slacks and a short sleeved white work shirt. Three pens poked out of the top pocket, blue, black and red. His black belt did not match his brown shoes. \n \n `` So this is it. Specimen 50. Previous name John Davies. Five foot eight, brown hair, brown eyes and a small mole on his left cheek,'' Boyle babbled, flicking the dossier to a page where a list of numbers and stats lay. \n \n The Colonel leaned close to the glass and stared at the room's inhabitant. He had not moved. After a few more minutes, he glanced down at his left wrist, blushed slightly when he realised he was not wearing a watch, then crossed his arms. \n \n `` Previous profession?'' \n \n `` Actuary. Quite a successful one as well. No wife or girlfriend. Hobbies included trainspotting and something called Reddit.'' \n \n The Colonel nodded slowly without taking his eyes off the man. Boyle smiled slightly and leaned back to the mic. \n \n `` Mr Davies? Please take a seat''. \n \n The man turned at the voice in a slow circle, before shrugging and seating himself. He folded his hands on the table in front of him and stared forward expectedly. \n \n The Colonel nodded once more and Boyle pressed a button to his left. A low growl could be heard emanating from a hidden room, growing louder. It then died away completely before bellowing out in a single sustained roar. The room's second door slid open, a shadowed gap in the white of the room. Slowly a single scaled limb stretched through, a sinewy hand tipped with curved talons. The rest of the creature slinked through, a multi limbed monstrosity, tipped with spines and spitting. It's gaze swung over to the glass pane and the men there saw the fierce intelligence behind the amber eyes. It winked, flexing its powerful shoulders and tapping its feet upon the floor. It gripped its prehensile tail in one hand and spun it slowly, eyes fixed on the men as it whirled the lethal appendage. \n \n Mr Davies coughed softly into a grey handkerchief. \n \n The alien's gaze snapped to him, its bright yellow tongue licking listlessly at its nostrils. It took one heavy step towards him and spread its arms wide, preparing one of its species now expected dramatic monologues on doom and destruction. Unintelligible to humanity but they had worked out the gist. It's great maw opened and the creature coughed violently. It's eyes widened, expanding to almost comic proportions as it gripped its throat and thrashed around. Mr Davies looked on with mild curiosity as the creature slowly slunk to the ground, one outstretched claw reaching out above it, as if searching for aid. \n \n The men behind the glass turned away from the creature's final performance and the stern Colonel had a smile on his face. \n \n `` Operation Beige is authorised with immediate effect''. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A deer with one blue eye and one yellow eye lay down in my driveway and died this morning ...\n","story":"It was the first deer he'd ever seen. Well, pictures of deer, he'd seen those. Middle school biology and nature channel documentaries. But flesh and blood deer, that was new. It had gangly knob ankles and limbs the crooked shape of two day old cigarettes. Not graceful or elegant in the slightest, Alex decided. It was also laying on his driveway, head propped up on its huge antlers, two mismatched eyes still and glassy as doll eyes. \n \n He ran his hand through the dry-dirt rough fur and felt its cold skin. Dead as a doorknob. It was also blocking his car. He grabbed its antlers and heaved-dragged-shuffled it off the drive, into the scraggly crab grass. Then he went to work. \n \n Later, eyes dry from double shift and late night inventory, Alex drove home and the deer had a girl standing over it. He parked and stood next to her. The live-wire buzzing of the electrical lines droned overhead, and they stared at a dead deer. Its blue and yellow eyes stared back. \n \n `` Do you want some coffee?'' Alex asked.The deer was as awkward and dry looking as before, but the girl was naked. He could see bare shoulder and collarbone and dead deer. \n \n `` Yes,'' the girl said and she went and tried his door while Alex paid too much attention to his key ring. She kept tugging the handle until Alex leaned in and unlocked it, then she walked inside. \n \n His coffee pot rattled and made a burned coffee smell, bitter and smoky, and the girl sat at the counter with an empty mug. Alex stared at the coffee maker, though all it did was rattle some more and gurgle on hot water. He asked, `` Who are you?'' \n \n The girl looked up, choppy dirty bangs flicking into her eyes. `` Rowan,'' she said. When Alex filled her mug she drank it, steam billowing, and said, `` This is awful.'' \n \n `` Sorry?'' \n \n `` I'm here to collect my pet,'' Rowan said, and emptied her mug. Coffee dripped from her lip and cleaned streaks of dirt from her chin. `` But it's too early. Do you have any meat?'' \n \n Alex had two ground burger in plastic packages, brain-grey and 50 % -off stickers still on. He began cooking one in a pan, wondering why he was doing it. Rowan watched the meat sizzle, chin on her hands. \n \n `` This place is awful,'' she said. She picked up meat between thumb and finger and sucked the juices. A fork lay beside her plate. Alex ran the fork tines through his plate, shifting meat squiggles around. \n \n `` Yeah,'' he replied. `` It's cheap and near the store. Some nights I ca n't sleep for the power cables outside.'' Wide awake with the buzzing of wires behind his eyes like an itch and choosing between the purple-dark of his eyelids or the silver-dark of the night. Mother saying he'd have a better life than a fifth floor apartment with one bed, one couch, and a broken freezer. Cars and trucks driving by his window and drowning out the wires for a moment with a louder roar. \n \n Rowan hummed and sucked her fingers clean. `` You could be my new pet,'' she said. `` You could leave here forever.'' Alex scrunched his mouth, and Rowan reached out to grab his cheek. From her wrist he smelled salt and peat and river water on sun-hot rocks. With one hand she finished her plate. The other cradled Alex's cheek. \n \n `` We would see wild places, and eat from trees and scraps. You could die a hundred times a day.'' Rowan patted his face and stood up. Her fingers left tingling lines like papercuts. `` Come on, I think it's time.'' \n \n They stepped out, Rowan leading. The wires buzzed. The sky turned silver-grey and empty, street lights stealing the stars and clouds. A truck blared by and left the sick-sweet gasoline smell behind. And Alex stood behind the strange girl as she knelt over the mismatched deer. \n \n Rowan slid her fingers into the eye-holes and plucked the deer's eyes out, pop-pop, holding them in her hand like marbles. Two big, glassy wet eyeballs rolling on her palm. She turned to Alex. `` Lay down.'' \n \n He lay down and she straddled his chest. Her fingers reached into his skull and wrapped around the backs of his eyes, migraine tight. Pop-pop. The new eyes pushed his skull out and back, moved his bones around as Rowan eased them in. Alex smelled salt and blood and gasoline, then he stopped being Alex.\n"}

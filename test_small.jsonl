( Context on description )\n","story":"`` Lock!'' I threw myself backward onto the metal grate floor and crawled helplessly backward away from the thick metal door that hissed loudly as it sealed. A heartbeat later a resounding thud echoed around the small corridor, then another- and another- Then an unending screech that, even through the thick metal cut through me so deeply I thought it would make my ears bleed. \n \n What the *fuck* was that- that- *thing*. It looked somewhat human, two legs, about the same length torso, a head, neck. It's about there that the similarities ended though- from the glimpse of it I'd seen it looked like a nightmarish Amputee- A steaming pile of *stinking* flesh that screeched and ran, and cut. Oh God- the cutting- How could I even forget for a second the cutting. \n \n It had moved quickly- and silently at first. If it had n't been for the motion-triggered lights inside the compound I would n't have stood a fucking chance. \n \n The facility has only a limited power supply so to try and make sure that no power was wasted the system was designed to waste nothing- That meant that the facility was plunged into darkness until someone moved into the area when the system would turn on the lights. \n \n I'd been making my way from the cafeteria to the med-station, Eve had been sick lately- Gone off her food for four or five days now, but PotPie was her favourite so maybe I could tempt her... \n \n Then the lights came on at the end of the corridor. Illuminating the doors to the surgery in a frame of black, I felt uneasy- then the next light flickered into life a few feet closer to me. What- a malfunction? The lights were only supposed to react to motion. \n \n I squinted into the darkness as another light flickered on, my unease shifted to nervousness- maybe fear. I continued to search the dark between me and the slowly advancing light. \n \n Then blackness. I'd been stood still- staring for a few seconds too long, the and the motion detector deactivated the light above me, I felt my heart skip as I glanced up and heart the wirr of the sensor flickering the light back into action- \n \n A screech rocked the hallway and suddenly in my peripheral vision I saw a black mass fall from the cieling casting a black silouette against the light of the surgery doors. I snapped my head to it's direction and waited horrific seconds for the light to activate above it. \n \n Too late- In a burst of speed it tore it's way toward me with powerful legs and that hellish screech. On instinct I screamed and tumbled backward, `` Shut!'' \n \n The metal door closed from the ceiling with nightmare-like slowness, all the while I could see the lights flickering on down the hall, and the creatures silouette advancing quickly. \n \n Two legs. \n \n A head. \n \n A neck. \n \n A torso. \n \n Human? That tail flailing behind it- cutting deep into the thick metal of the compound wall creating a horrible screech of torn metal as it lashed back and forward- was that where the sound had come from- I did n't care. \n \n `` Lock!'' The door hissed as the lock engaged- a heartbeat later the beast thudded heavily into the metal- that screech of torn metal... Would the door even slow it down?\n"}

I set Wealthy up on the counter and she immediately went to work alternately dabbing his knee with a wet cloth and blowing on it. We did n't have any suckers left so I grabbed a popsicle for each of us, orange green and red. When I returned the bandage was on and she was just bending down to kiss it better. I stifled the urge to pull her away. *He's five, after all. * I thought. *If she was going to bite him, she'd have done it already. * She'd never bitten anyone, not in all of her eight years on this earth so far.

The room smelled a lot nicer than any other place he had been in the city, the smell of incense was not so poignant and the lime laced curtains combated much of the stench coming from the river Clyde. Seymour stood by the window looking down on busy the cobbled streets, with her elbow in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She looked classy James thought then again she always did.

It was normal. \n \n However, a fifteen years ago, a woman was having a son, her husband in the room. And as soon as her son was born she looked right at her husband and said, `` I hope you die.'' Now, it's still not known whether or not the phrase was said in vain. But right when that baby started screaming her husband dropped dead. \n \n Doctors were stunned, and could n't revive him. They thought maybe the woman had poisoned him, but when they found out she had n't, they started doing tests. \n \n The woman in one group, other `` control'' subjects in the next. \n \n The original woman was inseminated again, and the control women were already all pregnant. \n \n On the day they had children, the original woman had another son, and she looked at the head scientist, who had taken her away from her first son and said `` It'll be you.'' \n \n Same story as the husband, as soon as the baby cried he dropped dead. \n \n The control women were different, one who had been raped was told to think of the person she hated the very most, the second was told to think of someone they loved but did not want dead and to say something along the lines of the original woman. \n \n When their dates came, the second woman had a daughter, and her mother was in the room and she said straight to her mothers face, `` Exchanged for you.'' And nothing happened. \n \n The other woman, her baby was born a week late, thought of her rapist who was in the next room over, when her son was born.

Perfect, everything she had asked for. Scrunching the top of the bag closed he stepped out into the frigid wind flowing in off the river.

Buildings hunched around him, past their prime, huddled together like old men protecting each other from the cold wind of the evening and the indifference of a world that had moved on. \n \n \n \n Once this area had bustled with light, loud shouts, and accusations ringing through the air as ships were unloaded by strong limbed youths and stoic stevedores. Money had flown into the city then, over a dozen ships a day, docking and unloading, bringing endless fuel for the bright burning furnace of the city. Televisions, Cars, Whitegoods, all of it had moved through the docks, leaving a slick of good fortune on the ground, a layer of wealth anyone with a strong back and willingness had been able to harvest. Now with the ships gone the money had retreated uptown, leaving the waterfront bare, those same workers grizzled old men hunched around oil barrels for warmth. \n \n \n \n That was how Christopher had found himself in this mess. Third generation dock worker, born to decline. Stamped from an outdated mold, tough men and tougher women, learning at the knees of their fathers to drive an industry forward that no longer wanted them. An outdated piece of machinery, a horse drawn buggy in a world of Cadillacs and Pickup trucks, useless before his time. What option did a kid like him have? No wonder he kept doing such stupid shit like this. \n \n \n \n As Christopher, mounted the rusted creaking steps to the loft he looked left to right, ensuring no one would see him. Jimmy would kill him if he was caught, not a haha, I \u2019 m going to kill you caper. No, more a bullet in the back of the head and a quick drop in the river kind of thing. Jimmy didn \u2019 t mess around, with his brutal justice and whispered commands, you listened to Jimmy if you knew what was good for you. Jimmy ran the whole damn gang, from whippet like Nick with his sandy blond bowl cut and nervous laugh to hunched shouldered Jack, with his protruding gut and endlessly repeated meandering stories, everyone listened to Jimmy. Their own marching little Napolean, short, round and scary as all hell. \n \n \n \n Jimmy was the guy with the plan, the mastermind, the dictator, the CEO of the whole fucking venture. One quick snatch, a growled phone call and then to wait. It was a perfect plan said Jimmy, no chance it could fail. Grab the only daughter of the richest family in the goddamn city and you better believe you were going to get paid. Christopher wasn \u2019 t so sure, he had seen to many movies end with cracking gunfire and blood-spattered brick to feel truly comfortable, but Jimmy \u2019 s immediate threat scared him worse than any imagined fate, so he did what he was told. So they waited. All of them crammed in this abandoned office, waiting a call that just had to come. \n \n \n \n She waited with them. That softly spoken girl with her wispy blonde hair and sad frightened eyes. She sat hunched on a chair in the corner, knees drawn to her chest and watched them watch her, watched this pacing pack of gorillas strut around like they had a plan. Pretty little Jessica, 12 years old if she was a day, kind, gentle, what a sweet kid. So different from the clamoring brats Christopher was used to, loud brash girls like his own sister Kim, with her stringy brown hair and shrill little voice. Nah, Jessica was different, something more pure, a delicate bird caught in their coarse filthy trap. \n \n \n \n Entering the loft once more Christopher nodded at Jack, sat leant against the wall on guard duty. He moved over to where Jessica waited, that same huddled pose in that same chair, waiting his return.

I heard someone saying, `` I think he needs more clean up'', and then I felt a rush of calmness, as though my mind was soaked in a pristine waterfall. I asked the operator, `` Where am I, am I dead?''. He looked hesitant to answer. Noticing that nobody was around to answer me, he said `` Ya I guess, I think that is what you people call it''. I was confused and starting to struggle to escape but something mysteriously kept me from moving too much. The operator started to panic `` Woah Woah, okay do n't panic. I'll explain. You see, you were in, uhhm.. hell''. Oh wait let me stop with the cognitive inhibitors'' I felt another rush, this time, it was followed by a number of strange realizations, I thought to myself, `` Wait a minute, hell??, I do n't believe in heaven or hell, not even in God, wait.. was I wrong all this time, what about all the science I learnt, evolution...''. He seem to have heard my thoughts, and appeared to be fascinated. He answered, `` Ya, do n't worry, all of that is true, I guess, we can give you the full explanation, you see around 500,000 years ago, we initiated Project Efficient Rehabilitation, which..'' He was interrupted by a women,'' Wait are you even cleared to debrief the prisoners'' she said to the operator. He panicked and said `` I am sorry, he seemed to have a good grasp of things, so I thought I'll explain...''. `` You have got to FOLLOW protocol!'' she screamed, we had two other similar cases today. The operator said, `` Ya I heard a scientist farm exploded, apparently that is why we have so many of them now''. `` What are you even saying, you mean the fire in their place of learning'' said the women. She mumbled `` No wonder you failed Natural Prison Logistics'' as he left the room. \n \n She turned to me, introduced herself `` Hi, I am Dr. BT. I will be Doctoring for you today, Please let me know if you do not understand me I'll try to frame things so that it is best understood by you, Ask me what ever question you have''. I mumbled `` What is Project Efficient Rehabilitation?''. She sighed, `` Okay, here it is, you see, around 500,000 years ago, we lost funding to construct mind vessels for non-conformant beings, so one of our research units came up with a cost effective plan to harness Level 2 planets to harbour the prisoners there. We somehow got it cleared by the Galactic Ethics Board, mainly thanks to the case made by the Director, Miss Lucy Fer, she got the approval and we seeded some potential species on your planet, with mutations that essentially create another room in their heads for our prisoners. So you were a scientist right, I think you guys called it the neocortex. The mutations were chosen such that neocortex kept increasing in size, but only if it succumbed to the penance the body imposed, such as reproduction, energy gathering etc.'' `` Penance??'' I confusedly asked. `` Oh sorry, I got too carried away'' `` Let me explain'', `` You see, the way evolution works, is things develop only if it is useful for survival, so the parasitic neocortex, was neurochemically slaved to the body's primal desires'', `` In this way, you see we get our automatic development of large number of vessels from evolution, but also, they satisfy the penance requirement for the crimes committed'' ``. She started to look at her watch, then suddenly someone peeped into the room and said `` We have almost fixed it''. Dr. BT then hurriedly finished `` So yeah, we now have a planet filled with vessels with the right penance requirement and living through the Darwinian struggle of the planet would be your punishment. Your time was up so you popped back to us''. She walked out to talk to the person outside the door. \n \n I was unusually calm and started to take in all the information, as I heard people running around in the corridor. I thought if my life was supposed to be hell, then why was it not so bad then, I mean sure hardships of life do exist, we do not always get what we want, reproductive impulses do sometimes cause more trouble than good, but overall mankind learned to cooperate and give ourselves a good standard of living. Dr. BT then entered the door partially and answered my question after hearing my thoughts, `` Well yeah, Director Lucy became short handed due to funding cuts, so she sort of left your planet on autopilot, and you guys.. well stepped up with your enlightenment and scientific method, but for the majority of its existence the project was pretty successful at its job''. I was shocked, was humanity suppressed all those years, I mean we are essentially the same species as the stone age caveman, but we needed the time to develop, right?. A voice outside, yelled `` Its fixed'', she replied `` Finally, damn these funding issues'', She turned to me and said `` Okay now, the machine is fixed so, get ready'', `` What machine? ``, `` Uhmm.. what do you people call it again..., Ah yes, reincarnation, you see your term is not served completely yet, the time you lived through had to be discounted to be worth only 10 %, because you know,... the scientific progress etc., its okay do n't worry, the Director told me she initiated some recent changes that should send the ball rolling to bring the penance levels back up again, thank you for your cooperation, its always hard to control you people when the auto reincarnation machine is broken'' She then pushed a button and in a flood of confused emotions I gave out a final yell `` Will I remember....'' and went back to sleep.\n"}

Any minute now they would emerge, land, and I would have to address both them and the rest of the world, of civilization, of our intentions. \n \n \n I tried to remember my speech, the words written by committee by three generations of us. *How do you fight the invincible? How do you hide from the omnipresent? * I swallowed hard. I knew the words. I could n't forget them. Words that would change everything. Words that would stick in my throat. \n \n \n The sky roared again and their ship finally emerged. It was exactly as the old pictures portrayed it. Exactly how my grandfather described it. As wide and as tall as three blocks of downtown skyscrapers. Countless lights, blinking and moving. Since it first arrived one hundreds years ago it's image was unescapable. I must had seen it every day of my adults life and yet here, now, its sheer size overwhelmed me. *We are not fighting for our future. We are also preserving. Preserving our achievements. Our advancements. Our humanity. * \n I must have started to look down at my shoes, because when General Mills grabbed my arm I jumped. I turned to him and his face was contorted in horror, eyes fixed on the sky behind me. I turned and immediately saw why; hundreds, maybe thousands of smaller replica ships were landing behind the mother. A trail of squares followed those that were landing, getting smaller and darker as they went up towards the fierce clouds. I turned back to Mills. `` What is this?'' \n `` An invasion'' his eyes firmly fixed on the skyline. \n \n \n I bit my lip. This was n't how it was agreed. They were supposed to return and give us a free shot. A chance. To wait and see what we could do. But they've now arrived ready to take it all. As if it's a forgone conclusion. Suddenly my words felt smoother, more palatable. \n \n \n *What can not be shared can not be taken. We will preserve. * \n The front of the mothership opened, as it did all those years ago, and out came one of them. Tall, fat, layered, floating. Above it span its communications wheel, hovering and whirring as it cut through the smoky air. It advanced towards me, perhaps staggered. I could n't tell. I did n't care. My mouth twisted in anticipation. \n \n \n *Everything ends. Everything. But not many have the chance to choose how. And this is our choice. Our terms. Our making. We will not go quietly. * \n I did n't stand on ceremony. I said the words. I said them to my colleagues, my family, my species. To the billions watching across the world. I settled. Began to enjoy it. I spoke of the decision being made early on, and the grand announcement. How life still prospered since their visit. And I even threw in a line about their intended invasion not phasing us. They could bring their entire race with them. We would preserve. Then I delivered the blow. \n \n \n `` You will not see us armed. We will not fight. But we will not go quietly. This is our earth. Our planet. It's history is ours, and we will not allow anyone to make all the lives we lost to get this far, mean nothing. Below the ground, at the core of the earth, lie our weapons. Every warhead and missile in the world. Buried. The nations of the world united in our declaration. You can kill us. But you can not take us.'' \n I turned to General Mills. His eyes were moist but his lip tightened. My head felt heavy, but I nodded. He turned and nodded to the team behind him, and it was done. \n \n \n The creature squelched and turned back to its ship. The communications wheel whistled, but I did n't care to translate. They tried to retreat, their ships blinking and whirring as they fired back up to leave, but it was too late. \n \n \n I felt thunder beneath my feet, and then... \n *It will end how it began. *\n"}

From his waist length blond hair, hipster scarf, thin frame and extremely feminine features, he's every yaoi fan's wet-dream. He's also my wet-dream, but that is a different story.

{"prompt":"[ IP ] A Meeting\n","story":"I meet her here every year and every year I feel like I know less and less. She smiles as we stand on the lonely trail, the water crashing down not that far away. The sunset has painted the sky in all shades of pink and purple and her eyes almost seem to glow with the same vibrancy. She takes her spot, leaning on the railing and looking down into the stream below and, as usual, I join her. \n \n It \u2019 s silent for a while, just the sound of the crashing water from the waterfall. Despite the beauty, I watch her out of the corner of my eye. She looks so happy, long hair trailing down her back. I wonder what she \u2019 s like away from the waterfall, for the rest of the year that I don \u2019 t see her. She knew a hell of a lot more about me than I knew about her. \n \n She had said that she lives out in the countryside, somewhere nearby. There isn \u2019 t a house for miles. \n \n She claimed that she looked a little weird normally. I can \u2019 t pick up a hint of makeup on her face. \n \n The strangest was the assertion about her father, who she made a vague statement about, something along the lines of keeping her away from people. \n \n She always seemed sad when she left, as if I was the only contact she would get until that next year would come. I don \u2019 t even know why I come back year after year. I had been born and raised in a nearby town, had played here when there had been some trees and plants growing in the area. More than just the green, green grass. Iceland was a hard place to grow things. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s lovely. \u201d I state, as usual. \n \n \u201c It always is. \u201d She smiles a little more. And then she does the unusual, leaning up and pressing a soft, gentle kiss to my cheek and returns to her original position. I \u2019 ve lost my train of thought, the normal conversation we usually have vanishing into thin air. I make a few noises, attempting to pluck ideas out but they vanish as well. \n \n \u201c I\u2026 um\u2026 ahm\u2026 \u201d She gives a small tittering laugh and I gather my courage, grasping at the only straw that my mind offers me. \u201c Can we get coffee or dinner or, um\u2026 something? \u201d She falls quiet for a while, eyes still trained on the waterfall before they move to rest on me. \n \n \u201c Maybe. \u201d Her smile \u2019 s turned soft and sad and then she turns to leave, brushing past me and leaving me staring at thin air. I whirl around after getting over my shock to find that she \u2019 s simply vanished. The trail is empty as it gets darker, the small solar-powered lights that line the path beginning to come on. A deep shiver runs through me and even though I \u2019 m frightened, I want next year to come quickly. \n \n As I leave, I pause to look up the hillside towards the smaller waterfall. I can see the little hills and rocks, a small \u00e1lfh\u00f3l pressed against one of the larger rocks. I could barely make out the violet shade coloring the elf house in the darkening night and I quickly hurry on.

''\n","story":"Her scream pierced sharply through the drone of non-stop rain, a multitude of birds, shocked, quickly chased off into the dark night that shrouded the forest. The rain beat down all around as she dropped to her knees, screaming again. He stood across from her, staring, still and silent. His black suit mottled against the black abyss of the sky over the edge of the cliff behind him. The trees blew slightly in the breeze, all the while sodden with rain. She screamed again. \n \n Looking at him as blood and tears ran down her face; she knelt hysterical, howling and crying before him. She pounded her face and the muddy ground with her bloody fists, screaming curses and wishes to wake up. She remained; alone on the pitch black edge of the world. \n \n `` Why?!'' she screamed, crying all the while. `` Why me?! What did I do?! Why me?!'' Lightning crashed down into the ocean, not far from the edge but unseeable through the fog and the rain. The dark figure stood, stock still, his face was blank and bore no facial features at all. He had no nose, no mouth, no eyes. Just a solid chin that stuck out from his tie. His arms were long, longer than a normal man's, he held his hands down by his sides, the tips of his fingers reached past his knees. Nor did he breathe, and seemed unaffected by the rain. Unmoving he stood, waiting, noiseless, staring at her. \n \n Hysteria turned to wrath, as she brought her head up and stared hard at the figure, the figure who had forced her here to the brink of the world. Slowly and painfully she stood to face him, cursing and shrieking with fury with each agonising movement. Holding her broken arm she staggered up at last, her torn clothes flowing in the wind. Sobbing as she stood, whimpering at the pain coursing through her. \n \n `` I will kill you! I hate you! Go to hell!'' She screamed, blood running down the corners of her mouth. She inhaled deeply before taking a step toward the figure. Another lightning bolt struck the earth close to them, for a brief moment the world went white and blinded she staggered, almost falling. The roar of thunder, like dragons waring in far off lands, snapped her back into reality. She blinked and looked again; in that split second he was now next to her. Still silent he now stood less than a metre away from her. \n \n Her wrath very quickly turned to panic as her world quickly started dissapearing. Stumbling and lightheaded, she once again found the floor, at the feet of the man. Her world crumbling as she started flitting in and out of conciousness, no longer sure of what was real. All she could hear was deafening white noise than now, for what seemed like an eternity, clenched her mind and stripped her of thought. \n \n He let her lay a few moments, fitting and screaming as her world came to a deafening and blinding end. Still not moving a muscle, he stood, staring straight in front of him, deep into the forest. Silently he waited, standing over her body. Another bolt of lightning struck the overlook and with the blinding flash, both of them were gone.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] a man driven almost insane from not remembering the title of a song overheard a stranger humming its tune\n","story":"*God damnit, what was the name? * I walked out the front door of my office building, clearly frustrated by something. The sound of a Louis Armstrong trumpet cadenza was looping endlessly in my head. St. Louis Blues? No. One of the infinite versions of Take the A Train? Not it. I climbed into the drivers seat of my car. `` Gahhh!!'' I screamed aloud while simultaneously slamming on the horn, I could see pedestrians casting concerned glances my way. I drove off, and as I pulled onto my street I took a glance in my rear view mirror, a big, black escalade was tailgaiting me. `` Get off my ass!'' I yelled into the emptiness of my car as I quickly pressed my foot down, brake checking the car behind me. I pulled into my driveway seething. *What the hell is going on? Am I this angry over the title of a song? * Every time my brain started to grasp the name of the track, it slipped away, and every time the title escaped me, my anger rose and darkened, like a thunder cloud off on the horizon. \n \n Instead of exiting my vehicle immediately, I leaned back in my chair taking deep breaths, trying to calm myself. Every attempt I made to clear my mind was thwarted by Louis Armstrong and his enticing melodies. *Why am I getting so angry? * The rational and emotional sides of my brain were clashing like tidal waves, and despite my best efforts, rationality was losing. *Alright, I need a fucking drink* I thought, and climbed out of my car. I started walking up my driveway. I was ready to punch a hole in my wall, but then, for the millionth time that day, I heard the tune, but this time it was a whistle, and it did not come from my mind, but from the other side of the street. \n \n I spun around on my heels, and saw my neighbor, happily gardening and whistling away, oblivious to the pain he was causing me. I marched across the street like a man on a mission from god. My neighbor saw me approaching and greeted me happily. \n \n `` Hey there neighbor!'' \n \n `` That song. Tell me the name.'' \n \n `` Uhh, what song?'' He said, with an anxious chuckle in his voice. \n \n `` The one you were just whistling!'' My voice was getting louder. \n \n `` I'm sorry, but I ca n't remember it!'' He was visibly frightened at this point. \n \n *No fucking way* I had spent all day agonizing over this, and here is the man who could deliver me from my torment... and he says he ca n't remember? `` BULLSHIT!'' I screamed, grabbing his shoulders. \n \n `` Hey man let go!'' He cried out. Before I knew what happened, I felt soft flesh impacting my fist. It... felt so good. `` I know...'' *thwack* `` you...'' *thwack* `` remember!'' I stopped for breath, and looked at my victim lying upon the ground, whimpering, his face a bloody mess. I stared a moment at my fist, now coated in scarlet. I sat down, my mind in a state of disbelief. *what have I done? * I thought. I could now hear the sound of sirens approaching. \n \n I made no struggle as the police handcuffed me and put me in the back of the car. The sound of the radio was my only companion in that lonely prison. \n \n `` And now, for jazz in the afternoon here on WGVU 90.4! We're going to start this session with a classic, and a favorite of mine.'' Said the MC. `` West End Blues, by Louis Armstrong!'' And there it was again. The trumpet cadenza rising and falling beautifully like the cool breeze blowing on the ocean shore. And then it came, at first, a low and rhythmic chuckle, which grew to a hysteric laughter, rising and falling, almost like Louis himself.\n"}

He killed himself, as did so many others, to try and stabilize matters for his own family, leaving behind his estimated remaining worth, $ 2,487. \n \n Unfortunately he did not succeed.

The illnesses had been laying siege to her heart for some time now, and the walls were ready to give in. But not now. Not yet. Eve still had to attend to unfinished business in this world. Her son. \n \n `` Joshua,'' Eve called softly. `` Joshua, do n't worry. I'm coming. I'm here for you,'' the old woman shuffled down the halls to the end of the house. *My sweet gift. My beloved. * Eve had prepared herself for this moment, but it did n't help her queasy stomach. *You asked for this. * She'd remind herself. *Joshua is ageless because of you.

You acted on emotion. * \n \n `` When have I not?'' Eve whispered to herself. Today would be no different than the day she had made the Deal, so many decades ago. She was beginning to forget the man's face. It might even have been a woman. Maybe neither. Or both. Eve thought that it really did n't matter at this point. \n \n All of her adult life, she had been told that she was infertile. Sterile. *Barren*. Eve was to forever be alone.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a `` normal '' person trying to fit in in a world where everyone is a psychopath .\n","story":"It's been three years since I've first arrived in this freak show of a world. I still do n't know how I arrived on this alternate world; I went to sleep one day, as usual, and poof everything was the different except it was n't. Erm, forgive me let me explain. I was the typical Joe, if you will. I had a loving wife who to be honest was n't the most stunning, knock your pants off woman in the world but she was loyal and I loved her. I had two sons, one 8 the other 12. I lived in a middle class suburbs of the metropolitan area of LA. Just living an ordinary, mundane life. Nothing special or unusual about me, just a regular Joe. One night I went to bed as usual but little did I know everything would change. \n \n When I awoke, the whole world was different yet the same. My surroundings all looked the same, aesthetically my wife, kids, tv, car, neighbor, yard, etc ( you get the gist ) all looked normal. However, their behavior was not normal. I went downstairs and there was nothing out of the ordinary. My wife was in the living room watching the morning news. She stood up and greeted me with a smile and kiss. I smiled and kissed her back and sat down to watch the news. On the news, the correspondent was talking about how a good samaritan was imprisoned for assisting an elderly person cross a busy road. I was speechless and said `` Can you believe those idiotic bastards? Why the hell would they incarcerate an innocent man who was simply helping someone cross the road?!'' My wife cocked her head to the side and looked at me perplexed. She replied, `` But honey, you know altruistic behavior is punishable and not tolerated by the government.'' I was speechless at her words. I replied panicky, `` You're joking right? Honey, please tell me you're joking. Please tell me you're being facetious.'' She opened her eyes real wide and shrilled, `` Babe, you know I do n't kid around. Humor is not one of my fortes.'' I broke into a cold sweat, closed my eyes, and tried to calm myself by internally repeating a mantra: `` You're in a bad dream. This ca n't be real.'' I did this for around 30 seconds; but when I reopened my eyes, everything was the same. \n \n I grabbed the remote and switched the channel to CNN. The anchorman was discussing a story where a scandal about an eccentric billionaire unfolded. He ostensibly had been surreptitiously donating large portions of his wealth to impoverished people in third world countries for several years. The anchorman stated that the public was enraged at his behavior and wanted him to be imprisoned immediately. \n \n I switched channels to PBS and Sesame Street was on. Big Bird was with a little kid and was teaching the kid how to properly `` roofie'' a girl to fornicate her. I turned off the tv utterly disgusted and started dry heaving. `` This ca n't be happening. This just fucking ca n't.'' I muttered to myself. My wife looked at me as if I committed a faux pas. She soon put her hand on my back and said, `` Hey did you not sleep well last night? I'll get you some tums and can schedule an appointment with a doctor for you if you want. Will that make you stop being a little bitch?'' At the word, `` bitch,'' I suddenly turned to her and she giggled at me as if she made a funny, anodyne remark. I shook my head in disbelief and said, `` No thanks. I do n't know why I've been acting weird; I'll stop. I promise.'' She smiled and said, `` Good. Now you better get dressed; otherwise, you'll be late for work. \n \n I soon dressed and left to go to work. At work, it was pretty much the same as it was at home. My male and female coworkers made sadistic, homophobic, xenophobic, and misogynistic\/misandrist remarks respectively. In my free time, I searched the internet for a possible explanations of this behavior but did n't find much. Websites such as Reddit and 4Chan contained many kind-hearted people whom the everyday people of this world considered conspiring, traitorous scum. I befriended many of them and tried to get an explanation for why mostly everyone in this world were callous assholes. They all said the same thing: that's the way things have always. \n \n It's been three years. Things have been the same everyday for the past three years. The only way I've coped with this is by communicating with my internet friends every day after work in the solitude of my house. I owe them greatly, if it was n't for them I probably would have offed myself years ago. I do n't know if things will ever change, but this is the world I live in now. In the words of my `` new'' wife, I have to suck it up and `` stop being a little bitch.''\n"}

I'm really sorry I arrived late again.'' I said like it was the first time even though it was probably the hundredth time. `` It's just that you know that I do n't really like this job.'' \n \n `` You always say that, yet you have n't looked for a solution.'' she said. `` Besides this job is not that bad. We have our own property, we do n't have to mine the gold for coins, we trade for it. There is no chance of the player or another NPC killing us.'' \n \n `` Yes and that's the problem. We always follow the same routine, even if there is no player at the time. It's really boring being the standard invulnerable shopkeepers. Also you know that we are not invulnerable, it's just that the players here are n't allowed to attack us,'' I answered quickly. To be honest I had been thinking about this for a while. Life like this tends to be boring, especially with only one player going around at the moment. I wish we were n't allocated to a single-player zone. My cousins in the MMORPG zone have it better than me, even though they can sometimes be robbed and mugged. But what's life without some risk? I want to find out. \n \n `` So what's your solution? You do have the experience to move on to another genre. Maybe you ca n't get a fancy job as an A.I. bot with respawn privileges but I bet you could become minion if you really want that risky life or maybe be part of a tutoria-'' \n \n `` No, I want more,'' I interrupted her. `` I want to be like the players, who roam around and can have any adventure they want!'' \n \n `` Hahaha you know that's impossible. Players are born and picked because of their unique qualities. Even if you had those qualities, you would n't know it because they do n't tell the people what are those qualities that make you apt to be a player. If somebody else heard what you said, they would probably think that you are a villain in the making,'' she said somewhat worried. \n \n `` Trust me, I do n't want to be a villain or a hero for that matter. I just want to be a player so I can go out wherever I want and whenever I want. It's not about the risks and rewards of that live, it's about being able to make your own choic-'' \n \n Sadly I never finished that sentence since I heard the doorbell ring. Suddenly we went quiet, like our job said we should do and started to recite the same lines we had been saying for the past years every time a player went into our store. As usual the player grunted, dropped a lot of stuff to sell and we traded it for the established amount of money. \n \n The worst part of it was that the player used to be my friend. We played around as kids until suddenly he was picked to be a player. Since then he does n't really care about me or his family. It's like he remembers but chooses to ignore us, like he was somebody else. My family tells me to be proud of him, because of him we attained the status of secondary characters. All of my family except me, who somehow was designed a tertiary character left to be forgotten. \n \n After he left, my coworker left looking annoyed since we could have been found out not acting in character by a player no less. That would have been definitely a capital punishment. Now that I was alone, I went through the stuff of the player in order to sending the appropriate materials to the recycling plant so they could be used in creating more items. \n \n I was so depressed of doing this again until I found something that looked like a machine, very different from the technology of the zone and even different from the genre we were in. It looked like some kind of computer and it was logged in with the profile of my friend. Before I could tell my coworker about my rare discovery, I found two options on the computer: log out and change player. \n \n Without hesitation I selected change player.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ OT ] SatChat : What inspired you to start writing more seriously ?\n","story":"I'' m a 40 year old male from Kentucky, and I've been writing poetry ( bad ) and stories ( Much better ) since I was 15. \n \n When I first started writing it was on index cards, hand written in about 6pt font equivalent. Bad poetry about sleep deprivation and death. Typical teen angsty stuff. \n \n Then we got a Packard Bell pentium 60 Mhz. It was a sad, pathetic machine that blew my mind, and I wrote using whatever word processor we had at the time. Over the years I've used MS Word, OpenOffice, yWrite, Notepad++, and most recently google docs. \n \n Google docs work well for me because it's so easy to pop open a browser and just write, regardless of where. And I know I wo n't *lose* crap. \n \n I write because I ca n't stop. I tried giving it up a while. I always end up coming back. THere are some very specific stories I want to tell, and I need to write them. \n \n Recently I finished my first full book, and it's about 160k words ( I will probably end up splitting it to two books because of the size ), and that took me about two years ( little under, actually ), but there would be months at a time when I did n't write *anything*. When I am typing, I go fast -- Aesop's fables test says adjusted to 48, but that's low for me. I do make mistakes, but I make fewer when writing from my head rather than copying. \n \n One day I'll start promoting my work, but for now, I'm doing work to allow the book to be split into two. \n \n As a plug for that story, here's a synopsis: \n \n Nearly two thousand years in the future, humanity has spread among the stars. We sent out hundreds, maybe thousands of colony ships, most of which were lost to our records even before the Awakening -- an apocalypse. The Awakening destroyed existing governments, existing continents, and brought with it war, famine, disease, loss of infrastructure, and general chaos. And magic. Then from the ashes, rose a new civilization based on a marriage of magic and technology. It has been almost a thousand years since the Arcanum, a new multi-star spanning empire now, was founded. In that time, humanity has remained convinced that we are alone in the universe. \n \n Carr, a seasoned Adept for the Arcanum Operations ( ArcOps ) military branch, is on a routine scouting mission when he and his Navigator run into an impossibility -- a forty kilometer wedge-shaped ship. Clearly alien, clearly impossible. From there, everything Carr thought he knew about the Arcanum, Magic, and the universe is challenged. \n \n -- -- - \n \n The story is technical in it's handling of magic -- there are strong rules, and there are a lot of things it *can't* do. But it can do a lot. Carr is a prodigy with personal issues, Nav is brilliant at his job, but utterly without ambition. And this does n't even touch on the other half of the story: A lost human colony is seeking it's homeworld and runs into it's own problems. Eventually all collide. \n \n\n"}

I had heard Time Travel was painful but nothing was ever said about landing on a rock. I sat up, judging by my clothes and the small village near by I gathered I had been sent back sometime between 1600 and 1700. `` Well then...'' I said out loud. This was a place I could presumably... live in. \n \n I rubbed my head, it was throbbing. I was trying to think on what the pioneer equivalent to an ice pack would be when I heard the screaming. I stood up and looked towards the sounds, and saw flames erupting from a house hold I could barely see. I ran uphill hoping to find a cliff from where I could see what was happening. It was illegal to send someone to any time of real consequence; so whatever was happening could n't be that bad. \n \n I found a cliff and almost screamed myself. Dozens of longboats unloading onto shore, Vikings. Of course. I was screwed. I could see white men and natives taking up arms, grabbing pistols and bows and whatever weaponry they had available. But I shook my head, I had never heard about a Viking attack in the US history books. That meant that survivors were going to be few and probably put into slavery. \n \n `` Well shit.'' I said again out loud, to no one in particular. I had two options. Run into the forest and hope they do n't go too far in mainland. Maybe I could find a nice tribe to settle with. Or two, go down there and meet my maker. I sighed watching the warriors start their raid of the small town. Giant looking men and women swinging their axes and huge swords. I crossed my arms, `` I deserves this. ``, and went down to the village. \n \n I came down behind a large viking male attempting to break down what I assumed was the blacksmith's door. It was just a guess given that it was one of the better put together houses. I snuck up behind him and grasped the sword he had struck into the ground, I pulled with all my strength and ran the viking through as hard as I could. I had no idea if this blacksmith would be historically important, but I knew I just slew a viking, I almost took pride in that. \n \n I turned to face a woman, she was n't wearing a helmet but she was clad in armor. Her blue eyes shined through the black line she had painted across her face. She spoke, `` oda goocheck smewupption.'' I was no linguist by any sort of the definition but I assumed that was some form of ancient Norse. `` I do not speak your language.'' I said with as much confident I could muster. I was a pretty tall guy, but not much with muscle. She on the other hand, was just about six feet and appeared to have never skipped a day at the gym. She was wielding an ax, and I must have been wielding a bullseye because she hurled that ax right at my chest. \n \n it struck hard right where she wanted it, sending me flying back a number of feet. The wind had been knocked out of me, I was swore, i could barely move... but I was n't bleeding. I heard the viking woman approach and it sounded like she was laughing, but she stopped when she saw I was n't dead. It took ALL of my strength to remove the ax from my chest. The tear in my shirt revealed the ax had stopped when it a piece of grey clothing someone had put on me. I tapped my finger on it, it felt like solid steel. But then how could I not feel it's weight? The viking woman lunged at me, picking me up by the collar of my shirt, but I was barely aware of that. Someone had put that... ax proof shirt on me, but why? And then it hit me: Someone wanted me to survive this!\n"}

Whatever it is, it's beyond the worst and most terrifying I could have imagined... \n \n At first when I realized I was alone here, I was kinda happy. A few days were spent running around enjoying everything I wanted to at a whim. There was gunfire and liquor and very quickly... I began to get serious about how lonely I was here. \n \n The buildings were all abandoned. All of them the same. Clothes all over the place, and the occasional mysterious pile of hair or weird chunks of metal. There were n't any animals either. It was dead quiet. I thought I was dead... maybe I am. \n \n A week ago I got so lonesome that I tried to end it. I actually DID end it. I had a shotgun and shot my head off. \n \n I was quite certain my aim was spot on, but when I woke up the next day, bleeding profusely out of my head with the worst headache imaginable... I was n't so certain I was alive anymore... \n \n Next to me was a shotgun sitting in a pool of blood. Flesh was scattered everywhere around it... I spent the next few hours traumatized before I tried picking up the shotgun again and aiming it underneath my chin, firmly grasping it so the blowback wo n't change anything... I pulled the trigger once more... \n \n Again I woke up in a hot, painful, wet panic... I thought it was sweat I was drenched with at first. My hands showed me it was blood rather quickly... \n \n The pain was intense... but I sat and experienced it in it's entirety. Eventually the pain subsided. I was so, so hungry. So weak... a nearby puddle of water taunted me with it's cool moist promise of life... a promise that was denied as I grew closer... it was actually a very, hot, bright, mirror... \n \n Even trying to look into the mirror caused the most intense of pains... and so I wandered about the endless landscapes and endured the loneliness once more. \n \n It was n't all so bad. With no one to judge and everything available, I found drugs in various houses and enjoyed videogames and fine foods everywhere I went. It was the loneliness that got to me the most. \n \n Eventually I'd fashioned dolls to keep me company with familiar faces. I went out of my way to study technology and eventually created very realistic looking machines... but they always acted withing predicted parameters... even in an ocean of familiar faces it was lonely. \n \n In due time, I'd learned to restore the entire world... at least... that's how it looked. Nobody was missing. \n \n As I worked, I found the urge to return to the mirror and try looking in it once more... but my skin ached just thinking about the place where I'd once tried to blow my own head off, twice... \n \n A sea of familiar faces... every piece in it's place... absolutely no insurrection... no challenge... no opponent. \n \n I've got an idea to maybe make this hell bearable again. A machine idea that could make me forget who I really am... after I'm done using it I would think I myself am one of my machines... and then at least I wo n't think I'm alone... \n \n Even if I eventually remember who I am, I can just forget again and have the system improve its methods each time. \n \n I wo n't have to be the only one anymore.

A 4ft Darth Vader and an equally tall Minion glanced up at me with their bags open in anticipation. \n \n `` You kids having a good time?''

I offered the bowl to them and nodded politely to their parents standing at my gate. \n \n `` Thank you Sir and may the force be with you'' Darth Vader called out as they both ran back up the path to their parents. \n \n I chuckled to myself. Kids these days. Store brought costumes. In my day we covered ourselves in toilet paper, in weak attempt to be a mummy, and would egg the neighbors houses. Maybe this was better. As much as a Minion is n't what I consider a scary costume at least they were having fun. \n \n I was pouring myself a fresh glass of scotch as the doorbell rang again. I looked at the time. 11:34. It had been at least half an hour since the last'trick or treaters' had been around and I had given the last of the sweets to The Joker and Batman so I did n't really have anything in my house to give to these kids. I staggered slightly getting to the front door, although not drunk, I was what you might consider slightly intoxicated. I opened the door to be greeted not by a child, or even a group of children but by a tall figure, possibly around 7ft as he totally eclipsed me and was looking down on me as I opened the door. This person was dressed head to toe in a long black robe that slightly floated in the breeze. \n \n `` Holy shit mate, thats an amazing costume, but are n't you a little old to be trick or treating?'' I asked, looking up at this person. Even as my eyes adjusted to the darkness of my porch I still could n't make out any facial features inside of the hood of the robe. \n \n `` I am Death. I do n't seek sweets. I'm here for you''. Death, as he claimed, spoke in a deep monotone tone and did n't adjust his posture at all whilst speaking. \n \n I laughed, drunkenly. \n \n `` Sorry man, fresh out. The Joker cleared me out. Apparently, when he said he wanted to play a game it meant him stealing the bowl and then running away. Batman did n't help, he pursued him, but I do n't think they're coming back. Something tells me he was n't the real Batman anyhow. I always imagined Bruce Wayne as being much taller and anyw.... \n \n `` Enough talking, it is time'' Death interrupted loudly. \n \n `` Time for what? Is it hammer time, please tell me its hammer time?'' I laughed to myself. I always seem much funnier when I'm drunk. Especially to myself. \n \n `` Hammer... Hammer what? Never mind. I am Death and I we have some buisnes...'' \n \n `` Look man''. I interrupted sternly. `` I've got no sweets left and I've got work in the morning, so if do n't mind taking your'holier than thou' spiel and go and find some sweets elsewhere, that would great''. \n \n He did n't reply and reached up slowly to the hood of this robe. The hood, now pulled back revealed only a skull. Even I had to admit, that this costume was very well put together. The mask, or so even the actually skull model he was using, was very realistic. A slight crack ran down the right side of the forehead and into the eye socket. The eyes. Were empty. Not in how you would expect a skull to be but black. Nothing but blackness. He started intently into my eyes, like he was staring into my soul. \n \n He spoke again. `` Look man'' he said, speaking in a much softer tone than before. `` I've got 8 more house visits to do tonight, *please*, come with me your time has come''. \n \n I laughed again. This guy could n't be serious. \n \n `` Look mate, I've already told you I ran out of sweets and plus you're far to old to be doing this anyways. I will say though, got job on the costume and you play the role very convincingly, but please, and mean this politely, piss off, I need to to sleep'' \n \n `` You always had a hot head Ross, maybe that's why your wife left you and that your kids want nothing to do with you''. The mouth of the skull head moved as he spoke. I took a step back, staggering slightly. \n \n `` How the fuck do you know my name?!'' I shouted at him `` Did Carol put you up to this? She always was a bitch. What is this, some sort of lesson I need to be taught? How to be a better father? You try putting up with someone like, I swear, given the chance, to do it all again, I would still have fucked her sis...'' \n \n `` ENOUGH'' He boomed. `` You need to learn when to shut up Ross, Jeez. Look man, you're dead I have come to take you the other side.'' He spoke calmly, almost the same way you spoke to a child when you wanted them to do something they were reluctant to do. \n \n `` Oh really?'' I asked rising my eyebrows and pursing my lips together in a mocking fashion. `` Tell me buddy how did I die'' I thought I may as-well humor this idiot, what did I have to lose? \n \n `` Suicide. A simple bullet to the head. Lights out''. \n \n I stopped mocking and looked intently at this guy. Suicide had been running through my mind all week, and the gun was actually loaded in the drawer in my lounge area. With this scotch in my system maybe this was the time. No, this guy could n't be for real. I'd had enough. \n \n `` Get fucked buddy'' I said, as a slammed the door in his face. I stumbled over to my armchair and finished the last sip of scotch. I placed the glass down on the table and opened the drawer under-neath. \n \n The doorbell rang again. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

For a second I thought it weird that in his life I am impeding him. I was frozen in fear and the big man without warning punched me straight in the stomach, I bent over and he pushed me down on the sidewalk. I felt hands going in my pockets and grabbing my phone and wallet. More kicks, more pain and the fear of it getting worse. I heard one of them say `` Your name is Kristoff, Ha, what a stupid name'' \n \n \n They had what they wanted but still they kept beating, then an unfortunate kick to my head that sent the world ringing and my thoughts escaped me. I felt as if someone else was there for a second, as if someone else was standing over me. And then the yell, a type of scream I've never heard before. Pain mixed with horror and splash of surprise. I opened my black and bruised eyes and was not prepared for what I saw. The big man lay on the floor with a leg missing, blood wetting the sidewalk. And all I could think of was how can it be that bright if its so dark. I stood up confused and still fearful. The small man had pulled his gun and was pointing it at me. But I had not done this, I was on the floor weak and defenseless... why fear me. \n \n \n `` Do n't move you asshole look what you did to Tim'' the small man said. `` I, I, I'' I could n't even speak as I raised my trembling hands. Whatever the small man saw he saw it coming for him and shot at me. BANG! the gun shot rang but strangely it seemed muffled compared to the beating I had just withstood. I saw something around me, a blur of a kind, a form that you can never really be sure you've seen. And nothing hit me, I looked up and saw the small man standing there with his gun pointed at me. And in the darkness i realized the morbid reality. His had been picked right off. Next to him it lay with the look of surprise still upon it. \n \n \n I did the only thing I could do, I ran. I ran past the bus stop as thoughts ran through my head. Thoughts of my child hood and bullies being pulled out of school for being strangely bruised. My step father dieing so suddenly in his sleep.

By this point, Sebastian had known the time by the millisecond, he'd known the distance in every system imaginable ( yes, including that stupid metric system ).

The setting was a wet, sharp hairpin turn with a flooded ditch ( about 35 ft of water he estimated ) and in it: a green mini-van submerged with a little 8 year old girl strapped in by her seatbelt. He remembers seeing the little bubbles rise to the surface, he knew what is was, it was a child's last cry for God, that the parents always said he'd be there for her. `` The rains were unpredicted, yeah. But what was so urgent that they needed to speed through heavy rains into that corner?'' Unfortunately his time traveling abilities were held back to only moments and places in time that he lived through, he could n't for as much as he wished, stop the family from going into the van. Originally he felt it his fault; even though he had been driving carefully and distanced himself, had he not been there it would've been an extra lane for space in the turn. After his first 12 attempts of him not being there he dismissed his blame, and for a while thought about quitting the rescue as it was this not-so-guilty guilt that had haunted him so many nights. `` No no no you bastard, you came here to save her not your conscious.'' \n \n Though he never knew the girl, he knew he just fucking knew that she had something great to live for. And this time he was more prepared than ever. He looked at his watch, `` 3 minutes till.'' He wondered if any drivers passing by found it odd that a guy was standing out in the rain, but he knew there were more crucial things on their minds; like getting home. It was a date, that he was originally on; he'd gone to the movies with his girlfriend and watched Infinitely Polar Bear, he kissed his girlfriend on her forehead and hugged her at the end, he was always a sap for the movies. `` I hope she understands'' he thought to himself as he took one last swig of his hot chocolate and had a quick thought of his grandmother ( she always made the best hot chocolate ). In 35 seconds that green van was coming full speed ahead after rushing to beat that yellow light. He recognized the poor faded yellow headlights as soon as it turned the corner. His heart pulsed and his eyes grew, he knew all the variables; and as long as long as the van did n't hit him on the way down, he could save her. And all within 5 seconds, the tires screeched and battled the water, the mini-van broke through the guardrail, and the loud splash the van made into the water. `` I'm alive in 41 different dimensions, she deserves to be alive in at least one of them'' and he dove straight into the brown muddy waters like an Olympic swimmer off their starting position. He was more than ever this time, to pay the ultimate price.\n"}

He didn \u2019 t know it was his birthday because he was usually strung out on heroine. He had met a girl a few months prior named Summer. Summer was a fun woman, but she had a 5-year-old son, a dead husband, and an addiction. Summer introduced him to heroine, and the two haven \u2019 t been apart since. \n \n He lived with his parents. He never moved out after high school. His mother was in prison again. His mother was never sober, which made wrecking vehicles a lot easier. She was in prison for her 7th DUI in the last 15 years. \n \n On his birthday, his dad came to his bedroom door. \n \n \u201c Hey! It \u2019 s almost noon. Wake up \u201d his dad said loudly while knocking on the door. \n \n Jesse groaned. He resented his father for trying to get him to wake up. \u2018 Can \u2019 t he just let me sleep? \u2019 he thought to himself. \n \n He rolled over to look at his phone. It was 11:53. There were 12 texts from Summer. \n \n \u201c Come on. Wake up. We need to talk. \u201d His dad said again. \n \n Twenty minutes later Jesse walked into the kitchen wearing only his boxers and socks. His dad was sitting at the small kitchen table that could hardly fit 2 people, which made dinners challenging when his mother wasn \u2019 t in prison. \n \n \u201c I want to tell you something that I haven \u2019 t told you before, \u201d his dad said softly. He was silent for a moment before he began again. \n \n \u201c You were supposed to have a sister. Your mother promised me she would stop doing drugs the first time she was pregnant. I had to work a lot to pay child support and she spent a lot of time alone at the house. She had men come over while I was at work because she was lonely and they brought her drugs, \u201d he explained. \n \n Jesse thought about his older half brother who turned 28 a few months ago. He hadn \u2019 t heard from him in 10 years. Jesse wondered if he was still alive. His father was married before he met his mother, and they were poor when he was growing up. \u2018 Fuck, we still are poor \u2019 Jesse thought to himself. \n \n \u201c I always wondered how life would be different if you had an older sister, \u201d he said, mostly to himself. \u201c Let \u2019 s have Summer and her son over for dinner.

When he was certain everyone was accounted for, he stood and addressed the room. \n \n `` Gentlemen,'' he began. A swarm of faces turned toward him, giving him their attention. \n \n `` Thank you all for coming.'' Ricardo's demeanor was calm and commanding, despite being the center of attention in a room full of every priest, rabbi, and imam in the city. But then, he had met them all before. \n \n `` I can not overemphasize the importance of the matter we are about to discuss.'' \n \n `` Or it's secrecy,'' piped up one of the imams. A murmur of agreement cascaded through the room. \n \n `` Let me assure you, we have complete privacy here.'' Ricardo raised his hands in a calming gesture. `` Rabbi Stein?'' \n \n On this cue, an aging man in a yarmulke stood up from his seat toward the back of the room. The swarm of faces turned to face him, bodies uncomfortably twisting in cheap metal folding chairs. \n \n `` This basement was originally constructed as a fallout shelter,'' said the rabbi in a hoarse voice. `` It was designed to withstand a nuclear blast. Every entrance is outfitted with three sets of locks.'' \n \n `` There you have it, gentlemen,'' said Father Ricardo. The swarm turned back around as the rabbi sat. `` We are safely away from any prying eyes.'' \n \n `` Still, you understand our concern,'' said a young priest in the front row. \n \n `` Of course,'' Father Ricardo said reassuringly. `` Every member of the press is hounding us all. At precisely ten o'clock this morning, every single one of you closed and locked the doors to your churches, your temples, your mosques, your synagogues, all with no comment whatsoever. We, of course, all know why, but no one else does.'' \n \n As he spoke, two members of the audience wheeled in an overhead projector, while another lowered a projection screen. \n \n `` Naturally,'' Father Ricardo continued, as if ignoring the activity around him, `` this has caused quite a stir. By ten fifteen, the story was on local news channels. By eleven o'clock, there were marches in the streets. And now, there are full-on riots all across the city. The public is confused and frightened, the newsrooms are chaotically busy, and the police are trying to deal with more than they can handle.'' \n \n The priest who had lowered the projection screen flipped off the lights, and one of the rabbis flipped on the projection screen. A set of blueprints for the bank across the street shone through the darkness onto the white canvas. \n \n `` Now,'' said Father Ricardo, `` *that* was the easy part.''\n"}

He had a master degrees in physics, although being unemployed for some time now; a passion for science fiction and space adventures graphic novels, a rubik cube he'd scramble and solve repeatedly, each cycle in about 15 seconds while he waited for the comunicator to scan for lower frequencies, and a notebook ( a paper one ) where he'd scratch frequencies, doodles, and math games. Hell, he even did so with a pen he'd tuck to his white shirt's pocket. Unemployed, a lot of free time, but with money from his premature retirement. Some friends that would call him, and he'd even grab a few beers with them too, but he preferred to stay alone. This was reinforced by the fact that he moved to a rural area and his only link was the line phone that sporadically went mute. The phone and the radio. \n \n The radio was his most ardent hobby. He'd talk with transatlantic freight operators, hermits, nerds, and all the technique of operating the transmiter felt like doing something important, almost classified. He even helped a tug boat that flipped over during a storm to get rescue. He was very proud of the radio. For such pride, when the thing started to receive very strange noises from almost every frequency he'd try, he had the stupid idea of getting up the roof to adjust the antena. He grabbed an extra aluminum rod and a ladder and went there. Of course, in his condition, he tripped, lost balance and felt, thankfully just after putting the new rod in place. After a few minutes grunting in the ground, he went back in, turned on the thing and same old, the noises, now even stronger. But then he realised something that only a nerd like him could realise. It was n't random noises. It was!! --!!! --!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!!!. and then!! again. Now why this was in every frequency he tried was out of his grasp. As he did n't know the frequency to answer, he just broadcasted it back, backwards,!!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!! --!!! -!!, put it on loop, and deemed solving another round of Rubik's cube. \n \n Meanwhile, a Trinotian, bored after inspecting all the inventory of plebotinum decided to check the communication room. Hopefully he'd be already in the Australis-8 gravitational field, and he'd be able to talk with his family. A 100 years trip was n't easy to stand away from family, even for a species that lives up to seventy thousand years. A hundred is still a long time. He checked his current position and tried to transmit to a frequency he'd know by heart now. Not even a beep. Sad, he looked at the void through a window and asked `` So, so many stars! and I'm here decades away from the only one to have someone to talk.''. As a sad joke, he broadcasted to a random frequency just a bunch of beeps!! --!!! --!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!!!, and at the same time he released the `` transmit'' button, a huge electrical noise echoed inside the ship, the lights went to pane, and he swear he could felt the wall below him accelerating against his floating body just for a moment. After the lights went back on, and he inspected the cargo bay for structural damage, he went back to the communication room and realised the transmiter was behaving oddly. Beeping his same last message over and over while the frequency adjustment rotated randomly on the screen. He mashed every button he could, and just when he was giving up, the frequency locked into a number and the message stopped beeping. But who knows why, with his eyes dead on the number locked in the frequency adjuster, he typed again, one last time!! --!!! --!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!!!. After a few seconds staring at the screen, the speakers of the cabin non-chalantly announced `` Receiving Message... Message received... Playing Message:!!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!! --!!! -!!... Message Over''.\n"}

I just ca n't see why you've got ta dress everything up in ten quid words. Look. Right. We've got this muscle-y bloke carrying a sword that looks at least three stone. Prob'ly magical. They're always magical. Then there's some bint wearin' a little red number that makes the lad down to pub start howlin'. \n \n How dare you sir! There's no need for your common filth to corrupt such an inspiring vista that will assuredly lead a tale of which the bards will sing through eternity. This noble savage shall - \n \n `` Hey!'' \n \n What? Who is that now? \n \n `` It's me. You noble freaking savage! The whole time you two assholes have been arguing, me and the lady have been stuck on top of a damned mountain. I do n't know if either of you geniuses have ever been on top of a mountain, but it's stupid cold up here. She's wearing a dress so thin you can watch her change her mind and I'm stuck up here without a shirt. Could you two, I do n't know, sort your shit out later?'' \n \n Yes, I suppose he's right. Much better spoken than I was expecting, to be honest. \n \n Blimey, he sure told you. You might want to make it up to him, guv. \n \n Really, and just how, pray tell, would I accomplish such a thing? \n \n Skip ahead a bit. Let'em get into the inn down in the valley.

Might as well go vegetarian.'' \n \n Fine. Victuals aplenty were laid before them by the proprietress of the quiet inn who seemed a lovely sort but was a keen observer of human nature. She had seen that truth of the blacksmith's wife last year and though it tore her heart out to tell that kind-hearted man of his wife's wandering, she felt that to do otherwise would make her complicit in the affair. The proprietress had been watching the two weary travelers make their way through the close-pressed crowd towards the bar and knew they - \n \n Oi! Just give'em the stew and shove the claptrap! \n \n You know what, it's yours now. I was just trying to add a little color - to make the world feel lived in and vibrant. But then you had to show up and-and-and-and piss all over it! \n \n Yeah, well, if you're going, then fuck off. \n \n The two kids got their grub, found a room, shagged a bit, then pressed on in the morning.

Though if I sit out here on the patio for five minutes longer without *a god-damned glass of water* that may well change. So I try to smile pretty, to hide my teeth so I do n't bite his head off, and I feel the sweat trickling down my back, into the hip-length cast that anchors me to the fat-tourist shopping scooter. \n \n `` Would you mind going inside and seeing if you can get someone to come out?'' I need him, at least until the cast comes off. \n \n `` Anything for you, sweetie,'' he says. \n \n While I wait, I drip sweat on my phone and play a game. The patio is deserted, but the restaurant proper is up eleven steps and it's the only place open during siesta. The apartment we're renting is overrun with roaches; I would n't cook there even if I could. So I ride in my little scooter and I curse the Mayans who had the nerve to let their temples get overgrown and the Mexican doctors who could n't turn a fractured femur into a sprain, and I wait, and I sweat, and I stew, and I think of all the ways I'm going to kill Max when I can walk away from the crime scene. \n \n Much like I'm waiting right now. \n \n Eventually, Max comes out trailing a thick-set waiter with a smile on his face and a plastic bottle in one hand. He says something that I most sincerely hope is an apology and he sets the bottle before me. \n \n The bottle is open. \n \n *Do n't drink the water*, the Internet says. And I do n't want -- do n't need, *ca n't possibly get* the shits with a hip cast. \n \n Sweat drips down the bottle's side, puddles on the table before me. \n \n *Montezuma's Revenge. * \n \n Did he open it just now? Or did he refill it from the tap? \n \n My head is swimming -- at least *something* gets to swim -- but I know for a fact that the feeling of shit running down a hip cast is something I desperately want to avoid. \n \n `` Se\u00f1or,'' I say. `` Un otro... bottle... oh, crap.'' I point to the place where the cap should be, mime screwing it on. \n \n The smile disappears like I've just leveled a gun at him. His brown face reddens and he lets off a stream of what I can only assume is *not* apologies. I try to apologize, say it's nothing personal. He wheels away, stomps toward the stairs. \n \n I eye the bottle. Max stands above me, looking down. `` Gretch, maybe --'' \n \n The waiter comes back, grabs the bottle. Droplets of water fly into the air, splatter on the table. I swear I can hear them sizzle. He wheels and stomps away. If I were myself I'd follow him, try to apologize. But I'm a scooter riding invalid. \n \n `` Max?'' I grind my teeth. `` Sweetie? Tell me the only open place in this entire godforsaken fucking town did n't just deny me service because I wanted to be sure the water was n't going to poison me.'' \n \n `` I tried,'' he says. \n \n `` Try harder.'' I do n't want to snap, but I ca n't help it. The heat, the dehydration, I barely know what I'm saying. \n \n `` C'mon, Gretch. Stores will be open --'' \n \n I'm about to pass out, I swear. Spots in front of my eyes, world narrowing down. I might die right here on this ridiculous red scooter. `` I do n't care if you have to give him a blowjob. I need a drink.'' \n \n `` Jesus.'' He stares down at me, hands on his hips. `` Jesus, Gretchen.'' He starts to turn toward the stairs again, then turns back to me. `` You know what? I'm sorry you fell. I'm sorry you're thirsty. I'm sorry this entire vacation has been a disaster. But I'm done putting up with this shit.'' \n \n Instead of going toward the stairs, he goes the other direction, down the dusty street toward our shitty apartment. Toward the airport beyond it, maybe. \n \n `` Max --'' \n \n He does n't look back. *Shit. * \n \n I turn the scooter's key. Maybe I can catch him. Make it right somehow. He ca n't leave me here, can he? \n \n Can he? \n \n The scooter moves three feet. Another four inches. \n \n And then dies. \n \n *Fuck. *\n"}

He'd just moved to a new place, to a side of the county I had n't been to before, and as luck would have it I somehow lost the beaten path and ended up walking through a dark patch of woods. \n \n \n I looked all around but it was just brambles, trees, bushes and the occasional nasty-looking patch of poison ivy. Everything seemed to have thorns and the overall effect was... spooky. I do n't like to think of myself as no kind of scaredy-cat, mind, but it was hard not to feel a little nervous in a place like this. I just kept walking. \n \n \n Eventually I saw a break in the trees, some light ahead. Through the clearing I could see the mountains in the distance, the sun shining bright on the snowy tops. Feeling better, I took a deep breath and walked more cheerful like toward the way out. \n \n \n Suddenly I heard a twig snap. Then another. Footsteps. There was some kind of critter heading my way - then all at once I looked up ahead and saw a giant mountain lion, eyes bright and shining, looking right at me like it was fixing to have me for dinner, crouching down low and ready to pounce. \n \n \n *SHIT! * I turned tail and started running as fast as I could go, not stopping to look behind me but listening to hear the big mountain cat's paws crunching on leaves and twigs as he ran after me. This is not how it was supposed to end, I thought to myself. Everything I'd ever regretted, every way I'd ever done someone wrong, all my sins and misdemeanors, everything rushed through my mind in those few moments as I ran back into the forest. \n \n I was dimly aware of running past a fence and a mailbox, but suddenly I heard a rifle shot ring out, then another, and another. I pulled up to a dead stop, wondering if I'd been shot, but instead I saw the mountain lion tearing away scared out of its mind, limping on one leg. I turned and suddenly saw an old man standing by the fence, appeared out of thin air like a ghost. He was very old, wise looking, with a rifle in his hand and a straw hat, decorated all round with a ring of green leaves, on his head. \n \n \n `` Evening there, friend,'' the man said amiably. `` Seems you've lost your way.'' \n \n `` Can you help me?'' I gasped, out of breath. `` I'm lost, I do n't know where I am...'' \n \n It suddenly occurred to me to look on my phone and find a map. I'd just gotten one of those new smartphones, and I knew it had a program that you could use, it would link up with a satellite and tell you exactly where you were. But when I opened the app, I fussed with it a little and could n't see anything. Just a blank open space and what must have been some error message, but I got this phone secondhand and whoever had it first must have spoke a different language, because I could n't understand the words on the screen: *Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'intrate. * \n \n \n I looked up at the old man, who was standing there patiently, watching me, knowingly. \n \n \n `` Who....where....'' \n \n \n The old man extended his hand formally, and I took it hesitantly. `` Name's Virgil,'' he said politely. `` You might say, you're exactly where you need to be.

Sensory and processing power of his brain picked up to normal pace and he set up to work on the monitor. \n \n Brandon returned with a recon drone and placed it in airlock.

The ships viewport was obscured by a haze of tiny dots that worked as a swarm. \n \n Brandon scrambled to his feet and hit the emergency button, the walls and every crevice shielded up from the outside world and auxiliary power kicked on. \n \n `` What the fuck was that! `` \n Brandon muttered furiously, \n \n Andrew pulled out his communicator on information net and pulled up diagnostic readings the ship collected. \n \n `` Brandon!

{"prompt":"[ IP ] The Last Stand\n","story":"A cold mist settled a few inches off the ground, concealing foot prints of both the sable stalking predator, and its prey: two noble warriors of white and black. Yellow eyes stared, unwavering, out from the darkness from the predator as it circled the two warriors. The scene set under dim moonlight on some open field, as both sides would soon see their fates. \n \n The predator circled the warriors, who stood back to back to one another; makeshift shields and long swords held in hand. Warriors and predators were fearless this night, for they'd set the stage the night before, when the warriors avenged their young on the predator's litter -- killing the predator's young as the predator had killed the warrior's young. \n \n Now it was only to see who's desire for retribution was greater by the judgement of God and patron moon both. \n \n The predator swung back from its circling and pounced, claws out, fangs bared. The black warrior shielded himself from her anger with his shield and sword, and was only saved from falling backward by the back of the white warrior -- the former's mate. \n \n Once mother and father, white and black, struggled to stay upright against the bigger, vengeful mother. Neither side would give ground this night, nor mercy. \n \n The predator rolled with the black warrior, separating him from his mate. The black warrior rolled with the predator in turn, stabbing and slashing wildly at its mortal enemy as his flanks were slashed and torn by the predator's claws. \n \n Neither side made a sound as they fought in a furious death ball of claws and blade. \n \n The predator, bleeding from a dozen small wounds, jumped free of the black warrior, then quickly left him behind to assault the white warrior, who slashed at the much bigger predator with her sword, warding the predator off. \n \n The predator screamed in pain. The black warrior had sliced half the predator's tail off, and was now hacking at her backside. \n \n The predator spun and slashed in retaliation, catching the black warrior across the face, blinding him. The predator took advantage of the black warrior's wound to dive in with fangs, catching the black warrior around the neck. \n \n Yet the black warrior was n't done just yet. He plunged his sword into the predator's neck, and bit down hard with his two teeth, as well, aiming for her jugular. \n \n The black warrior's neck snapped with a jerk of the predator's head, killing him instantly. But the black warrior still held his enemy's neck in his teeth with a dead grip, not letting go, even in death. \n \n The predator shook her head, trying to free herself from the dead warrior's grip, when the white warrior dove below the predator's belly and slit her mate's killer's belly open from side-to-side. \n \n The predator screamed then, breaking the self-imposed silence of the night's deadly play. \n \n The white warrior slashed vengefully at the predator's belly, cutting it open many times, bathed in the killer of her babies' innard. \n \n Mortally wounded, the predator ran away, still carrying the black warrior on her neck, and collapsed a dozen feet away with a pitiful mew. \n \n The white warrior was victorious, yet saddened, for her mate had lost his life in the fight holding the agile predator in place for the white warrior to strike. She wailed once in the darkness for her mate, then fell silent once more,'less she attract more predators of the night. \n \n The white warrior returned to its empty nest, where it collapsed in the straw and paper and wept for her lost children and mate. At least comforted knowing vengeance, she cried herself to sleep in the safety of her nest as morning dawned azure over the killing fields known as Jensen's farm. \n \n The two-legged tall ones weeped for the predator, as the white warrior weeped for her own losses, ignorant to the murder that preceded the violent night.

There was the way she had finally propositioned him one day, her nose sunburnt, and he had accepted anyway. \n \n Why, she wondered, would he imply it had been any other way? \n \n `` Sir, yes, sir.'' Mary finally tells him, her voice firm and she thinks that she can see him smile. \n \n `` You are less susceptible than I thought. Commander Clarke? What I'm about to show you is so top-secret that we had to invent a new security clearance level for it.'' \n \n `` Is this related to Abe?'' Mary asked her tone almost defensive. Her husband was, she had to admit, the gentlest man that she had ever met. Prone to sickness, but always able to smile for her. \n \n He had gone missing, three months into her pregnancy. She still had yet to hear from him, and there was a solid pit of fear in her chest that she would n't. \n \n `` Yes. We believe your husband may be an illegal alien. However there is more to this than that.'' A nurse comes to the door of the room with a wheelchair, the conversation not causing even a moment's hesitation as she parked it at the side of Mary's bed. \n \n `` I can walk.'' Mary told him, her voice growing icy. She prickled at his accusation that the man she loved, that the man she may have lost had been lying to her. This was all too much right now, on a day where she was already worn thin. Where he should have been there. \n \n `` Safety, Ma'am.'' The nurse tells her simply. `` Liability if not that.'' \n \n She opened her mouth to speak, increasingly frustrated and the man in black held up a solitary finger. `` Commander Clarke - Mary. Trust me; you'll want to be sitting for this. It is n't your husband that I'm taking you to see.'' \n \n It takes more effort than Mary thought she had left in her to relent, realization striking her as to where they were likely going. \n \n `` When will I get to see my son?'' Mary asked the nurse who looked at her like a deer in the headlights. `` He was born at 0900; it's been over three hours.'' \n \n `` Or-'' Mary started again when the nurse edged away and the man in the black suit started to smile again. `` Is he what you're intending to show me.'' \n \n `` Please.'' the man told her simply, gesturing to the chair. She forced down the panic rising inside of her gut. If something had happened to him, if there was something wrong, she would lose her last connection to Abe. She would lose the only family that she had. \n \n Mary surprises herself with her stoicism as she moves from the bed to the chair, and the nurse leaves. It is the man who takes the chair's handles and steers her half-dressed from her room.\n"}

One day the dart keeps landing in one specific country , no matter how many times you throw it .\n","story":"I have a teleportation device that will instantly take me to wherever on a map a randomly thrown dart hits. Until today this has been great, and this method adds a great sense of adventure to my travels. So far it has taken me to Britain, Hawaii, France, through most of the United States and Canada, but today was different. I decided that I would travel this weekend so I threw the dart at the map with my eyes closed, and I felt the teleportation device transporting me. When the teleportation finished I opened my eyes only to see sand. I looked at my map and found that I ended up in the worst place possible: a war zone, Afghanistan. Then I heard the drone of 4 turbo prop engines. As the plane came closer I saw that it was a C-130 which is a US Air force transport aircraft. Then the ramp at the tail of the C-130 opened, and a large parachute came out, dragging a pointed cylinder. I knew what this was, it was the most powerful non nuclear bomb: a MOAB, the mother of all bombs. I picked up the dart, closed my eyes and threw it. Crap it landed in the same hole, I tried again and again but the dart would not land anywhere on the map but this doomed location. The bomb is getting closer until I decided to cheat the system by going to the map and stabbing the dart into the United States, but it did not work, the location has to be random. The mother of all bombs was less than a quarter mile from the ground, where it would detonate and instantly vaporize me. I then closed my eyes and stabbed the dart into the map randomly, the location was hundreds of miles from my home, but at least I am not being killed by the first usage of that huge bomb.\n"}

Through revolution , we have no idea where the parasite is hiding in our body , but one day ... ... .\n","story":"I've been single for nearly three years now, and it's gotten to the point of being shameful. I tried creeping around bars, but I am constitutionally inept in public places -- I tried online dating, but unfortunately my words are far prettier than my face. I finally got to the point where I started hitting up old high-school acquaintances, and I've been working my way sadly down the list. \n \n Today I arranged to meet with one of those, with a familiar old Rebecca, at a coffee shop. It's always awkward to see someone again after fifteen years, when you never knew them very well to begin with -- I always start these conversations by vaguely trying to recall the teachers that we had together, and the final impression they left on us. Me and Rebecca talk about Mr. Lucas for a while, and about the time he had to have a substitute come in because he passed out while vomiting on the toilet and got a concussion. The kind of shared memory that really bonds two individuals, even after fifteen years. \n \n I'm pleasantly surprised by the condition of her face -- she's aged remarkably well. I wo n't tell her that, it's not appropriate. But I do feel compelled to bring up the overwhelming cross that she's wearing around her neck, since I do n't recall her as being religious. \n \n `` Rebecca,'' I say, `` what is this monstrosity around your neck?'' It looks like a piece of driftwood, nailed to a fragment of a railroad tie. The chain is, by necessity, thicker than my index finger ( admittedly, I have small hands ). I do n't mean to be rude, but it does seem rather much for good taste. \n \n She says, `` Oh, this. I have to wear this. God told me to.'' \n \n I breath in and breath out. I do n't mean to be an overbearing atheist, but often I am. If we lived in a world without etiquette, I would have gladly walked away at that moment. But out of obligation, and perhaps out of a small curiosity, I tried to make conversation out of it instead. \n \n `` God told you to? He talks to you a lot?'' \n \n `` Only recently,'' she says. \n \n We're getting to the core, already. She's had some sort of traumatic episode within the past few months, it's messed up her mind, and that's why she's on the same pathetic trajectory as I am, of surveying forgotten acquaintances. I say, `` Well how did that start?'' \n \n She says, `` Well, I never used to be religious at all, but I spent a lot of time at the hospital. I was very sick, but God helped me.'' \n \n `` If it's not too much to ask, what were you sick with?'' \n \n `` Appendicitis,'' she says. `` I'd been in pain for so very long. I lost a lot of weight ( I'd noticed ), I felt nauseous all the time. But I did n't think anything was really wrong until it ruptured. I almost died, but they were able to remove it all. \n \n `` God appeared to me that night. He was holding my appendix in his right hand and he said,'Daughter of Eve, you've been cleansed of your sins. You must make a cross, and wear it. And thou shall live a holy life.' I've been wearing this ever since. And I've been so much happier, I really have.'' She takes a sip of her coffee, as if to emphasize the point. \n \n I am reaching my limits. I say, `` What kind of God would soil his hands with an infected appendix? Do you know what causes appendicitis? Fecal blockage. It's a strange kind of god that would n't at least put a sterile glove on before picking that thing up. Was he wearing a glove? Do you remember?'' \n \n She's taken aback. She says, `` No, I uh... No. No glove.'' \n \n `` Well see, that's why I do n't believe you.'' I stand up, very much wanting to be done with the whole ordeal. `` It's been a pleasure, Rebecca. And be careful around wood chippers. If that thing gets sucked in, it will take you with it.'' \n \n I am surprised to see, as I begin to turn away, not a look of disdain, or hurt -- but compassion. \n \n\n"}

It reminds me of the first time you taught me how to ski in Maine. We shared so many hours that week together on that mountain, but you were just my best friend.

Now they are something else, something between people and monsters. And in the desert Badlands, on the slopes and in the valleys of the Charred Peaks they built a home for themselves amongst the mortal races. With their foul magics, they turned the sands to ash and the skies into storms. \n \n Hellspawn or no, the mercantile princes of Veluka did not care. Their neighbor across the desert would sell strange spices and metals mined beneath the Charred Peaks, in return for slaves from across the world. Not for labor though, as breeding stock, to dilute their corrupted blood before they turned to mindless monsters. \n \n They say the Unleashed are warriors, waging a constant war, but nobody quite knows who on. Not their neighbors, who steer clear of them. Who, then? The heavens, who cast their forebearers out so long ago? The abyss, from which they were exiled in turn, or did they escape? They do not say. \n \n Once, only once, the Unleashed went to war. It was in the later days of the Radiant Church \u2019 s madness and zealotry. Hundreds of their own people had been branded heretics and cast out to the desert to die, for the smallest of crimes. Imagine their outrage when they were found alive and well. On the rich ash, under the rain of the storms, they grew crops and tended to herds, kept safe from bandits and priests by a wall of tooth and claw. \n \n Was it the defiance of their god-given punishment? Was it the culmination of years and decades of hatred, preached against the hellspawn? Or was it simple politics, an excuse to seize rich farmland and precious mines? In the end, it didn \u2019 t matter. The Bright City went to war against the Unleashed. A great crusade was called and launched.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You win the jackpot in the lottery , and get to decide between 10 million dollars and the contents of a mistery-box . You choose the box , and it 's totally worth it .\n","story":"The tall man escorted me silently down the long empty corridor. The florescent lights evenly illuminated the stark white walls periodically broken by the frame of a closed door. As we neared the end of he hallway, the dark haired, clean cut man stopped abruptly. \n \n `` Mr. Brendon, your prize is right through this door. Take your time making the final decision. Once a choice is made, you ca n't change your mind.'' With that, my escort stepped aside. \n \n The room provided no relief from the sterile decor of the rest of the building. The white walls, ceiling, and floor were devoid of any adornments or color with the exception of two platforms. The first platform was covered from edge to edge with neat stacks of crisp $ 100 bills, held together tightly with thin white paper bands. The other contained a small stainless steel box with no visible hinges or markings. I looked in awe of the large pile of money. I had never been this close to that kind of money in my life. As I took a few steps towards the platforms, I could smell the freshly printed bills. \n \n The cash was clearly the most logical choice. I was almost out of money after being out of work for the last 4 years. But as I looked at the money, I felt no joy, no excitement, no respite from my own personal torment. What would I do with all this money? Buy a larger box to waste away in? Try and find something to give my life meaning? It seemed like a long shot at best. \n \n The small box sat modestly on it's platform. It's simple and ordinary nature made the rest of this place look almost extravagant. But for all of its mundane appearances, there was something alluring about it. I could n't imagine anything in such a small box being worth much, but that did n't seem to matter much. Before I realized it, I was peering at the box from above, my feet resting at the base of the nearly empty platform. I took one last glance at the money sitting beside me. I would never have another opportunity like this again. What would everyone think of me for turning down that much wealth?... Everyone? Who is everyone? I had n't spoken to any friends in at least 2 years. My family was gone. The one person I had once truly cared about was dead. \n \n I picked up the box. It was heavier than I had anticipated. I still could n't find any hinges but as I pulled up on the top half of the box, the thin horizontal seam encircling the middle of the box began to widen. I could n't help but hold my breath as I pulled the top away to reveal my choice. A pale yellow pill sat in the middle of the miniature white pillow filling most the box. As I lifted the pill from the box, I hesitated. This could be anything. I turned my head to look back towards the door I entered through. It remained closed. Somehow I doubted that the quiet gentleman who escorted me down here would know any more than I did. \n \n `` Well... I'm certainly not going to waste something that I paid $ 10 million for.'' I tossed the pill towards the back of my throat and swallowed. I did n't feel any different. Maybe it was just a sugar pill meant to teach people not to be greedy. I began to walk towards the door to be escorted back out. \n \n Everything was black. That smell... it was familiar, but what was it. I breathed deeper through my nostrils. The sweet fragrance made me feel at peace, like everything was right in the world. I recognized it, but could n't place it. Why could n't I see? I tried to move but my body was n't responding. \n \n `` I must be dreaming.'' \n \n I tried again to send signals to my muscles to move. Finally it responded and I rolled over onto my back. As I laid there with my eyes still closed, my body's senses began to return. I felt the comfort of my own bed around me. But the smell did n't fade away with my dreams. I stopped, frozen by the realization of what that familiar fragrance was. I turned my head to the left and forced my eyes to open. Her golden shining hair was strewn across the pillow next to mine. When I realized I had been holding my breath, I drew another one in. I again smelled the floral scent of her shampoo. \n \n Was she real? I sat up to get a better look. A smile grew across her face as she opened her eyes to look up into mine. That perfect smile that I'd give anything to see. She brought her hand up from beneath the covers to wipe away the tears rolling down my cheek. \n \n I finally gathered my thoughts enough to speak. `` Is it really you?'' \n \n `` That's a... complicated answer. But for the most part yes.'' \n \n `` But how?'' \n \n She gave a small giggle. `` That's another complicated one.'' Her smile lessened slightly. `` You should know something though. This is only for one day. And it will never work again.'' \n \n I fell onto her and buried my face in the covers. I could n't hold it in any longer and began to weep. \n \n `` Shhh, it's ok babe.'' Her soft fingers made their way through my hair comfortingly as she squeezed me close. \n \n `` But I miss you so much.'' \n \n `` I know. But I'm here now.'' \n \n `` You're right.

From the direction Orville and Harold had been walking, a mall security guard was riding in an topless golf cart, but it \u2019 s rubber tire gripped the wall, riding it all the way past Orville and Harold. \n \n Orville looked around. \u201c Harold, look at this. Now all these snot-nose kids are tinkerin \u2019 in our buisness. You \u2019 re 80! You don \u2019 t need a damn nurse yet!

Tying his shoe! ^Don \u2019 t embarass us Harold! \u201d \n \n As the hot-dog girl and custodian staggered closer and Harold incessantly groaned on the floor Orville began to notice that they weren \u2019 t coming to help Harold, but were coming straight for himself. \n \n \u201c Hey! He \u2019 s the one attacked me! He \u2019 s half-Jap, and I have them veterans reflexes. \u201d Orville clenched his cane as the two got closer. \n \n At that moment the security guards buggy hit a sharp corner, which reoriented him in Orvilles direction. Orville saw the guard approaching, and he stepped to the side and he wound up his cane in anticipation. Nine heart-racing seconds later the vehicle was within cane \u2019 s length and Orville swung at the passing guard. The guard fell off the back, but Orville hooked the steering wheel with the handle of his cane! It pulled Orville a few inches where he tripped over the ground-flailing Harold and landed miraculously into the drivers position of the vehicle. \n \n Orville \u2019 s mind hadn \u2019 t caught up to his reflexive instincts and he tried piecing the previous few moments together as he coasted down the mall. \n \n \u201c What was I doi\u2026 Oh yeah. The JC Penny. \u201d Orville checked his watch, 9:02. \n \n *Harold will just have to meet me there, * Orville thought to himself. \n \n The front doors of the mall unlocked automatically at 9AM, letting in a sea of zombie shoppers. Orville drove the car down the mall, rolling over the undead shoppers as he advanced towards his destination. \n \n \u201c Use a sidewalk, hippies! \u201d\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You realise that you are on sale\n","story":"I ticked my latest hacking job and two successful assassinations from my list and leaned back. \n \n *Nothing like a successful week* I thought and stripped out of my clothes, strewing them purposefully across the room. Then I lay down on the familiar mat labeled with my ID number. It felt comfortable and familiar as it quietly vibrated back into the tube where it had come from. Cables snaked their way into the ports around my body. I heard the tube seal shut and it immediately started filling with liquid. I should probably know what the stuff is, but really all I care about is that it feels warm and like being stroked all over. My maintenance program is firing off and automatically loosens all my muscles. Robot arms come out to heal up my wounds and scrapes. Obviously that is n't what is happening in my mind. In my mind I have just come home to my gorgeous boyfriend, who has greeted me with a long hug, followed by a loving massage and the gently bandaging of my various ailments. Robot arms are unromantic. \n \n Sadly this day I could n't get into my fantasy. I was usually good with this. My fantasy boyfriend had a cooking repertoire and everything. Not that I eat much. I used to, but it took up too much time. With my boyfriend I can have long candlelit dinners though. He likes to hear about my days so much that I can just talk and talk and talk. Oh and naturally *he* is n't a security risk, so I can tell him what I actually do. Unlike every other actual breathing being on this planet. I stared slightly grumpily outside as the door opens and George comes in. He is n't actually called George. I just call him that because they all look the same to me. \n \n That's on purpose I believe. Prevents anyone using me to assassinate one of them. If I ca n't distinguish them, I ca n't kill an individual. Clever programming if you think about it, but utterly infuriating if those penguins are all you can talk to. So I have started giving them random names and changing them periodically, assuming that by now they should be different people. I would feel sympathy, but I did n't get that emotion for obvious reasons. \n \n George looked around in exasperation and then glared at me. I gave him my best `` innocent girl'' smile. It should be pretty good as they made me practice it for hours with the mirror and video sequences. Apparently it can still get old though. George at least was unimpressed and started collecting my clothes. I always get a kick out of that one: Best in your year, at least a decade of exemplary service, commendations from the highest quarters to be allowed into this secret group around the shiny new super weapon ( s? ) only so you can pick up my knickers. Welcome to the pinnacle of your career! \n \n My mood was improving with each of George's scowls, but then he started blabbing and whining. `` Dignity... blahblah, responsibility to your country... blahblah, habits sustainable in war...'' I promptly turned on the television right behind him and put the volume up. \n \n `` The government has confirmed the fact it had to declare bankruptcy. According to sources close to the president it is now trying to raise enough funds by selling all non vital assets-'' George had turned the TV off. \n \n `` OY! What the hell do you think you are doing?'' I exploded from the speaker above him right into his ears. He turned to face me and in that split second I knew something was wrong. I knew the signs. It was my job to read faces. The corner of his mouth was twitching involuntarily. His skin tone was paler than it had been when he'd come in. A tiny drop of sweat formed on his forehead. He had controlled his heart beat, but that was n't enough to fool me. \n \n He took a breath and then smoothly told me something about disrespect and that that is n't the right stuff to relax to. I needed to be 100 % for my next mission. The usual trite. Then he hung around. He never hangs around... I think. Most of them ca n't wait to get the hell out of here. I even upped the temperature a bit and slowed the air con to get him out, but he was resistant. In the end I could n't be bothered to deal with him and just closed my eyes. I halted the stand by program. It's meant to be a security feature, so they know when I am'active'. Eyes shut in the tube means nighty-night. Unless you created a being with the specific ability to break programs. To be fair it took me about three months to break the stupid thing while pretending to watch endless TV series. Has been very useful since though. \n \n Took George only three minutes to leave once he though I was'asleep'. Something is definitively up. I started with the news pages, which had nothing but the bankruptcy. George interrupted the news on that, so I found the news clip and played it, but there was absolutely nothing of note. Two hours later I was convinced that the problem would not become apparent through main stream media. I would have to pull contacts. Ah well. I logged into the world of none indexed homepages and checked a few forums. Nothing there. No one had heard anything. Apart from my friend n00bkillah ( shut up, his info is usually good ) who had heard that a load of super hot stuff had hit the auctions down here. They are serious about this whole money making thing. \n \n When the last of my contacts came out empty, I decided to try an auction, just because it was the only thing unusual that popped up. Finding the site was a bit of.....an adventure, even by my standards. Yeah and then I saw the screen of the auction with ten hours on the clock and my specifications. I almost fainted if I had been able to. So much for loyalty! These guys wanted to liquidate me! And then I saw the options. Only a handful of people even knew I existed and I could identify them, because they all looked like George. Then I could get out of here. May be be normal. I felt myself blushing - may be find that boyfriend. I wonder how many Georges there are... We shall see. But if they think they can hold me, they have another thing coming. I typed in the amount I felt I could get out of accounts, government or otherwise, and hit `` bid now''. `` Sorry, darling. I will be with you soon'' I said tonelessly into a cloud of bubbles. *But now I have some money to make*\n"}

He was clad in shining armour, with a brash smirk on his face. I stood up to have a word with him, but before I could start, he had driven his sickeningly clean sword and had chopped a chair clean in twain. The men and women pulled themselves to their feet hastily, and backed away from the still-smiling man, who's photogenic hair was staying firmly in place as he \n moved on to a fine oaken table.

No other expression passed his face bar that terrible smile. \n \n `` Er, yes'' I started, taken aback ``, but-'' \n \n `` Do you have a quest for me innkeeper.''

Why did I continue to do avoid my priorities if I felt so bad about not doing them? Would n't my life be more achieving if I just did what I told myself I was going to do? Easier said then done I suppose. \n \n A knock came from the other side of my door while I was reciting my typical Thursday night of doing nothing more than playing video games and being lazy. The brief sound made me jump from my seat. I was n't used to getting any visitors at anytime, let alone this time of the night. Convinced my mind was just playing tricks on me I switched my attention back to my TV. Another knock, another sudden turn of my head towards the entrance. This time it was real. I trembled to my feet and cautiously walked towards the door. All sorts of possibilities of what will happen next racing through my head. `` Who's... who's there?'' my eerie voice gave away my vulnerability. \n \n `` You.'' A familiar voice answered immediately. My body and mind paused. \n \n `` Who?'' \n \n `` It's you.'' The voice was calm and confident in contrast to mine. \n \n `` I'm sorry, I do n't know anybody named You.'' Why did I say that. \n \n `` My name is Harrison Baldt Jorgerforsson. My mother died when I was five and I was raised by my father and his multiple girlfriends in San Francisco. I like football and basketball and played it until my senior year of highschool. I enjoy reading, bicycling and absolutely love movies.'' How could this be? Was I being confronted by my own impostor? Surely some prank was being pulled on me by some lonely no life college kids.

The only person in the whole world who knew who my first kiss was is the girl herself. \n \n `` Emily Dober, sixth grade, behind the bleachers.'' He was right. My jaw dropped as had no idea how to go forth with this situation. We shared a brief moment of silence before curiosity got the best me. In a cautious tone I opened the door only to see my eyes staring right back at me. I was staring a reflection, a perfect resembling duplicate of myself. As if I was staring at a mirror. He was smiling at me like he knew exactly what my face would look like when I saw him. We maintained eye contact with each other for a long and awkward time and shared the silence of the night outside. `` Hello Harry.'' The man said. \n \n I was convinced what I was seeing was not real. That this surreal and enigmatic moment was not happening. My eyes were questioning all of the logical knowledge that I had accumulated throughout the years. Perhaps my sense of feel would bring me back to reality.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The lottery is an Institution designed to catch Time Travelers .\n","story":"When I was a child I made a mistake. My school had a set of farm animal toys. I loved the donkey. It was less obnoxious than the family of horses and more interesting than the sheep and cows. There were many of those but only one donkey. I played with it every day at every opportunity and sometimes I would put it in my pocket and let it ride around on me in the lunch break and designated play times. \n \n One day a new kid arrived in school. She sat next to me and everything started off fine. She liked farm animals too. At first she was content to play with the sheep, jumping them over fences and the like. When sheep were n't enough she played with the cows. Daisy and her friends got in quite the set of adventures. But even the cows could n't sate her hunger. She wanted more. The horses barely lasted a week. I could see where this was headed and I did n't like it. Not one bit. \n \n I turned up to school on a particular thursday and it had happened. The donkey was gone, and she had it. I sat next to her and watched my donkey pull imaginary carts around the field. I wanted it back. I watched her feed my donkey imaginary sugar lumps. I wanted it back. I watched my donkey frolic with the other animals. I took it back! I ran from the classroom to the outside whereupon I threw it over the fence into the bushes. If my donkey and I could n't play then no one could. I stood shaking for a while then cried and cried and cried. \n \n I regretted my actions, my mistake. I waned my donkey back. If only I could go back in time... \n \n An excellent idea I thought. So I screwed up my eyes and tried really hard. I willed myself back. I remembered my donkey sailing over the fence and imagined me being there catching it and putting it in my pocket. I checked my pocket but my donkey was n't there. I tried a few more times but it quickly became clear that I could n't time travel. Now I needed a new plan. I needed someone who could do it. \n \n I sit in my chair. It is comfy, very comfy. The best that money could buy, if you did n't want one of those irritable vibrating chairs that offer so called `` massages'' but really convince you that either your back is going to break or the chair will. But it is an excellent chair. A tasteful shade of grey. A good number of wheels so that I can slide from end to end of my imposing mahogany desk. It commands the room. Almost a dining table sized desk yet it only had three allocated chairs. One is very comfy, the others not so. They are n't bad but if you sat in one you knew that you are not going to be sitting in it for long. Uncomfy chairs keep meetings short. That is what I had discovered and it is what I like. This is my domain. I am king of Camalot and this is my throne. \n \n Over a score of years had built up to this point. Building my kingdom. Putting everything together. Starting the national lottery had been no small feat. I needed something that had a huge reward. A small tax on everyone in the country is a logical way to gather that money. I needed something that was utterly predictable with hindsight. The numbers go out in all the papers so all you need is an old paper. This is a foolproof plan. I chuckle to myself, why if I were a time traveller how could I resist such an opportunity. \n \n Now all I have to do is wait then we can go back and correct that mistake.\n"}

Now she is in charge of operations at The Jovian System, and currently finds herself in low-orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter. She gave an irate sigh at this exacerbated question. Having just informed Director Musk, the most powerful man in the solar system, of intelligent radio communication on what was supposed to be an uninhabited system, she expected more than this reply. \n \n `` A 38 minute delay in communication and this is all he has to say... Fuck's sake, he probably thinks the team is picking up its own ground scanning signals. How incompetent does he believe us to be?'' \n \n Mark, one of the pilots of the mission and the only other person on-board the orbiter, kept his intense focus on his work. `` Probably just as shocked as we are,'' he said as he ruled out the use of modulation techniques on the signal. He was confident he could decipher the radio clicks quicker than the team of experts back on Earth. Besides, he had a head start, and they still had to relay their findings across vast amounts of space. `` The Galileo project showed habitable conditions, and JUICE proved definitively that no life was on the surface. We're all just trying to figure out what the hell is going on.'' \n \n A screen in front of Mark showed the constant and unmistakably intelligent signal, as received by the team on the surface and relayed back to them where they were hovering in geostationary orbit. The signal varied in amplitude, frequency, and phase, but there was clear no methodology behind this. The only controlled variable seemed to be the length of the pulses and the length of the gaps between pulses. Almost like an advanced Morse code, Mark thought to himself, just utilising a larger variable set. \n \n `` Ania,'' he kept scribbling on his note pad, `` the manner in which this code varies... It's not modulation. There's no structure, no pattern.'' He looked up at her, `` I think it's organic.'' \n \n `` You mean someone, *something*, is speaking to us in electromagnetic waves?'' She glanced at the Earth-link again, hoping for something more, something she can act on. \n \n `` Well it's certainly not like anyth...'' Mark broke off. He dashed down a rough table on a clean slate of paper, feverishly inserting values. `` Oh, God. They're using our UPC encoding.'' \n \n There was no excitement at having solved the riddle. His face ashened as he lifted the paper for Ania to read: \n \n `` Hello, vermin, and welcome to our planet! We have been awaiting your invasion.''\n"}

There should be a garden on the 18th floor, if our math is right, you'll land just fine. You'll go through the french doors, if they're locked, go through em anyway. Sam has been sitting on the place for weeks, so it should be empty if we time it right. \n \n Head downstairs - and Ben, take care of the security. Cameras, alarms, whatever they've got. The rest of you are heading to the old man's office, it should be on the same floor, the place is big, but you'll find it. \n \n Once you're in, I want you to take everything you can see, nailed down or not. Paintings, wine, and every fuckin' key he's got. Once you're ready, we take the lift downstairs, pick your ride, and drive the hell out of there. With any luck the cops will still be a block down wondering where the hell we went, and we'll be heading to the meet, free and clear. \n \n Relax now boys, it's going to be a long day. \n \n **I decided that using the Rube Goldberg machine from [ Ok Go - This Too Shall Pass ] ( http: \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch? v=qybUFnY7Y8w ) would be a fun inspiration**\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A group of people worship a small , plain , clear glass marble . You touch it , and realise why .\n","story":"`` Let me pass!'' Pontius' voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd. Like fresh snow in spring the assembled group melted back, revealing a path to the plinth upon which it stood. One or two bowed their heads respectfully as the Senator passed, but many stared at him. They were hard faced and angry, gaunt men with fire in their eyes and angry women clutching children to their side. Walking beside his master, Aquilus kept close, for fear that the crowd would forget their places. \n \n \n They stayed, however, watching Pontius as he approached the glass ball. Someone had placed it on a velvet pillow, and it was nestled there as a pearl in an oyster, reflecting the midday sun. To Aquilus' ears the sounds of the market had stilled. No flies buzzed, no traders haggled. Even the familiar sound of priests preaching to whoever would hear them was absent. \n \n \n Aquilus remembered the sentries on the gates as they had passed through in the cool morning. Even in their leather and bronze uniform they had looked thin. No cats or dogs chased each other through the narrow streets. He could not smell bread, could not see a single amphora. This city was starving. The children around him were bloated in their hunger and their eyes followed him. He hurried his step. \n \n \n Pontius extended a hand towards the glass marble and the crowd held its breath. Aquilus watched a bead of sweat as it escaped his master's hairline and trickled down his neck. Pontius licked his lips. His finger touched against the glass marble and his eyes flickered shut. He was transfixed, held there for an eternity, though when he let go Aquilus realised it had only been as long as it took to release a breath. \n \n \n `` I understand,'' Pontius said to the assembled crowd. Still the men watched him in silence. No weapons were permitted in the Forum, but one or two had whips or short knives at their sides. All Aquilus held was the wax tablet, beginning to melt fluidly under his arm in this heat. Pontius carried no armament himself. `` I understand,'' he said again. `` Our gods have spoken.'' \n \n \n Aquilus flicked a nervous glance towards the marble. The sun beamed overhead, glowing against the clear glass. \n \n \n `` What have you learned, master?'' He asked in an undertone to Pontius. \n \n \n `` Only the man who touches it can know,'' Pontius replied evenly. `` But we must not delay, we must leave this city as soon as we can.'' \n \n \n `` The horses will not be fresh,'' Aquilus responded. They had begun to move through the crowd again. Was it his imagination or were there more of them than before? Tanned brown hands moved to the knives at their belts. Pontius' steps were slow and unhurried, like those of a man in a dream. \n \n \n `` Damn the horses,'' Pontius said. His face was pouring with sweat. `` We must...'' He keeled, down onto his knees. Aquilus grasped at his master's arm as the man fell, looking up at the hungry crowd as they closed around him. One man bared his teeth like a dog. \n \n \n `` What did you see?'' Aquilus asked, struggling to raise the man up again. Tanned hands reached for him and he slapped them away. `` Off! Off!'' He cried. `` What did you see?'' \n \n \n `` You must touch it to know,'' Pontius wheezed. \n \n \n Aquilus reached for the marble, the sun glaring from the glass into his eye and as he touched the smooth glass, he was blind. \n \n \n And he saw the Fall. Barbarians spilling into the white city. Sacking, looting, burning. An empire brought to its knees, the bronze wolf turned upon her side and her suckling babes turned out onto the hard roads. He removed his hand and saw the same fire in the crowd's eyes that he knew blazed in his own. It was no longer a time for worship, but a time for war.\n"}

Instead of creating grand plans to conquer the world , all you do is run around and free other captured supervillains from prison , after the superheroes defeat them .\n","story":"`` Aw jeez,'' I thought to myself, `` Which one is it?'' \n \n I jingled through the mass of keys attached to the Keymaster's Ring: a ring about 6 inches in diameter crowded with master keys to most of the planet's prisons. \n \n `` I should probably organize this thing, huh?'' I nervously laughed, a bit flustered and hoping The Cryomaniac would n't immediately freeze me once I set him free from his cell. Some supervillain I was, always afraid of the guy I'm trying to set free. \n \n `` Yeah...'' He replied absently, clearly getting a bit frustrated with my fumbling around. \n \n A few minutes and many keys later the heavy iron lock opened with a loud clank. \n \n `` Ah, there we are!'' I said, trying to act like I knew what I was doing ( I did n't ), `` and here is your Freez-o-Ray from the armory, you should be all set.'' I handed him the ray-gun and flashed him the double thumbs up in a weak attempt at camaraderie. It had taken me 20 minutes to find the right key for armory, which I immediately lost on the key ring upon entering the armory, resulting in 20 *more* minutes of looking on the ring once I got to his cell. \n \n `` Great,'' He said, clearly not thinking I was great, `` thanks a lot, uh...'' \n \n `` Keymaster,'' I supplied, holding up the key ring and pointing to it. \n \n `` Right, Keymaster. As repayment for setting me free, do you have any requests for who I should target next for Cryolimination? A specific person, perhaps, or a group of people?'' \n \n Now, this was the part of my job that I *lived* for. The Cryomaniac's question set ablaze a fire in my eyes; igniting an inferno of hate in my soul that burned me to my very core. \n \n `` Just one request.'' I answered slowly, in a voice of newfound weight that can be heard in the voice of one speaking directly from the mouth of their maker. \n \n `` Yes, anything.'' He sounded a bit taken aback. \n \n *'' The Locksmiths. `` *\n"}

You escape your death date , but the reason why its a law in the first place is revealed to you .\n","story":"The glaring red numbers ticked down with the cadence of a beating heart. Each pulse of light washed across my face like ocean waves, each with what felt like a hammer. \n \n My time. \n \n It was n't enough that I gave up most of my life fighting in the Agarian wars, it was n't enough that I had given up flesh for them, and after all that the medals in the box by my bed did n't really mean shit. The numbers ticked down. \n \n I perused the room to make sure I did n't leave anything behind. Not a whole lot mattered except those damn numbers on my arm. The chip in my hand activated the door and it slid away, a quiet hiss following it's exit. I took a moment to glance down the metal halls to confirm that they were empty. Officer deck did have it's privileges, including access to the jet deck. I did not have much time left, both because they were tracking me and it was *literally* running out. \n \n Moving quickly through the dimmed florescent lighting I hoped that the clanging of my boots would n't reverberate too far. Slipping through the shadows and the bulkheads I moved toward my goal where Lamy was waiting. The woman claimed she loved me, but we would see how far that would go tonight. Though she was more than 45000 hours my junior, I had grown fond of her. \n \n A familiar discordant rhythm sounded in the distance. Peacekeepers. Breaking into a run I heard them marching in the distance, to me or my room, I was unsure, but best not to risk it. Abandoning stealth, I ran to the jet deck. \n \n `` Lamy?'' I whispered loudly, wandering around the silent sentinels. I needed her for access to the damn birds. Idly I noted only a fifteenth of an hour remaining on my time. So low. My pulse quickened, far faster than the pulsing light that created garish shadows along the smooth aerodynamic lines of the jets. \n \n `` Lamy?!'' The whisper came out louder, harsher, and echoed back to me. A hand covered my mouth and pulled me into the darkness. The hand became lips and that was all that was needed to pull me in. She pulled away and turned on small hand light, giving me a toothy grin. Her normally neat brown hair was tussled, jump suit askew. Eyes matching her hair color looked me over from below a forehead slightly too wide, above a nose slight too broad for her to be called pretty. \n \n She hit me. `` Have a baby? I've been waiting down here long enough for you to.'' \n \n `` Good to see you too, Lamy, now give me the code so I can get out of here.'' \n \n `` You were making so much noise you would n't hear a Agar sneak up on you.'' \n \n I grunted. Not a pleasant thought. 4-5 meters in height with long dorsal appendages that ended with claws that cut through hardened armor and jaws that savored human flesh. I had given a lifetime, and a hand, fending them off colonies. I hoped the fucker enjoyed eating it in his last moments. I robbed him of the chance to follow me around like hook's crocodile, which Agars were said to do even through deadness of vacuum. \n \n She waved her hand and the bay opened in the back of an old cargo jet. Colloquially called Free Birds. Nice touch. \n \n `` Where the hell did you dig up this fossil?'' I asked. \n \n `` Lower bays.'' She replied as she climbed up. `` Now hurry up, they probably noticed you're not doing your ritual auto-canoodling by now.'' I rolled my eyes at her back side. Reaching up I noticed my time was all zeros. No longer flashing, but fading. Disconcerted I climbed up and noted the spartan cargo bay straight to the cockpit where Lamy was seated. Utility at it's finest. I walked up to her, and saw that she was strapped in. \n \n `` What are you doing?'' \n \n `` I'm coming.'' The tone chipper as always. \n \n `` The hell you are, you're already risking enough getting this bird for me. You could be exiled for that alone. Anything more is execution.'' I tried to drive the severity to her. \n \n `` I'm. Coming.'' Her tone brokered no argument. She stopped what she was doing, blinking lights flashing in her eyes, and fixed me with a glare. I leaned over her and started undoing her straps. \n \n `` No.'' \n \n She slapped me, and started to redo her straps. I picked her up before she could finish what she was doing and started walking to the back of the ship. She started kicking and screaming when I heard a sound that grabbed my chest. Peacekeepers. They were here. \n \n `` It does n't matter now, let's go.'' I hit the seal button on the cargo bay door, agonizing how slowly it shut. Lamy and I ran to the front \n eschewing the rest of the pre-flight checks. The ship rumbled to life, and my seat was vibrating which made my back itch. I hit the throttle and made for the outgang. \n \n `` Wait. The doors!'' \n \n I slipped the bird through them as they siphoned shut. A straight away lead to freedom. \n \n `` Weapons?'' I inquired. \n \n `` Packer rockets.'' \n \n I raised an eyebrow. This was going to fun with that kind of ordinance. I flipped on the arming keys and blood dripped down my nose. Lamy's slap? Probably. I guess I really was getting soft. Rockets spiraled ahead in the artificial atmosphere, followed by smoke trails. Half way to the target the rockets split into dozens of smaller streams and increased velocity. Probably overkill for a door, but it was going to look spectacular. \n \n I felt the vibrations from the explosions rather than hearing them. The smoke trails reversed direction as they were sucked out into the vacuum. Home free. All this excitement was actually making me feel dizzy! We blew out with the missile debris, I did n't even realize I was hold my breath. \n \n Freedom. \n \n \n `` Where should we go? Sector 3458? 4112?'' Lamy asked me. I still felt like I had a fog about my mind, which made it hard to think. I answered with a passionate kiss. \n \n `` Ow! You bit me!.'' I blinked in surprise, I had n't realized. My back was really feeling like it was itching now, what was wrong with these chairs? \n \n `` Hello, asshole! Did you hear me?'' I did and I did n't, my head was ringing, and a I felt a pulsing pull, reminiscent of my time running down. Not gone after all. A stinging in my face pulled me back and I realized Lamy hit me again. I began to admonish her when the itching in my back turned to tearing and pain. So much pain. A agonizing eternity, I watched Lamy's scowl turn to a horrified shriek. \n \n My wings! My beautiful wings! I looked at them enraptured in their dripping beauty, the sharp digits at the end still hardening. My communion was interrupted by my bones suddenly changing from with in. Ecstasy mixed with pain, Lamy's screams the orchestra to my ascension. \n \n She started to run. She did n't get very far. At least not her arm. Shock took over for her as I dipped it into my maw. Sweet flowing life force to replace the energy I was losing in my transformation. \n \n She was crawling from me. \n \n Saying only one thing. `` Agar. Agar. Agar.'' \n \n I took the rest of her then. \n \n I sat back down at the controls, blood and ichor surrounding me and felt the pull again. I directed the ship toward the pulse. To my new home. My new life. Freedom.\n"}

You are the first person to be born with totally black eyes .\n","story":"Long ago, humanity developed a defense against their natural predators. At the time, we called it'vision'' and the name has n't changed much now. Everyone is born with white eyes, and when you turn 18, there's a reaction that occurs in your brain that shifts your eyes to a new color. We have the reds, capable of ferocious strength accompanied by an equally ferocious temper. The yellows, with their holier-than-thou attitude and their control over The Light. The blues are an odd bunch, they keep to themselves and do n't say much. Their power was thought to only be absurdly high intellect, but it was discovered only recently that they can, with practice, affect the matter around them. Once you stray from the pure colors, you'll see less power and more variety in abilities. Surprisingly, it's not your parents or your personality that dictates what vision you will have, it's simply a genetic lottery. Your personality only changes after the fact. For this reason, most parents excuse the rebellious nature of teens. \n \n I'm 17 and turning 18 tomorrow. There's a lot of excitement and even more worry. Will I be a different person after that day? Will I notice it? Who knows. We've been prepared for this day all of our lives and have learned everything there is to know about vision. All of my friends have already begun their lives and left our teenage years behind them. I hate my parents for birthing me so late into the year. \n \n `` Remember son, we will always love you, no matter what color you get.'' My father told me with his warm orange eyes. \n \n `` Mmmhm'' My mother murmured in agreement. She did n't say much, but that was a lot from her as a blue. \n \n `` Thanks.'' I said as I went into my room and let the day's worries drift away. \n \n In my sleep, I encountered something strange. An apparition. It was so plain in the white room that I stood in, and so out of place. It drifted menacingly upon me, leaving a dark stain on the perfect white walls. \n `` What do you fear?'' It asked me. \n \n `` What are you?'' was all my mind could say as a storm of questions passed through me. \n \n `` Surely you do not fear me?'' it asked. `` Have you ever looked at yourself clearly?'' \n \n As if I were under his suggestion, I turned my head to the conveniently placed mirror on the wall. Without a moment's wait, the room went dark only to return to the way it was before my mysterious visitor barged in. What I saw in the mirror, however, was different. A complete, void of light, blackness had replaced by white eyes. And that too was fleeting as the black color drained out of my eyes to return to the white that had originally been there. \n \n ******************************************************* \n \n `` This can not be.'' My father spoke, mortified. `` His eyes are still white, dear.'' \n \n `` Council of the six'' my mother declared with her weak voice. \n \n `` This is a pile of crap!'' \n \n Boom! \n \n A heap of dust polluted the air. The wind howled into the house through the gape left by my father's fist. \n \n And then, the dust slowed and stopped. My father slowed and stopped. The clock on the wall slowed and stopped. I got up to touch the frozen figures and could n't interact with them at all. As if this was n't strange enough, my'friend' decided to pay a visit. \n \n `` When all is still, is n't the world a lot less scary?'' The more human-like apparition asked. \n \n `` What are you?'' \n \n `` A foolish question. Let me show you.'' \n \n It turned into a he. Then a she. And finally, into me. \n \n `` We did n't learn about this at school.'' \n \n `` That's because you're special. You won the lottery. You get to live with me.'' \n \n `` Then how about you answer my question. What are you?'' \n \n `` A consequence of a colorless brat, you fear that which you do not understand.'' he carried on, `` Instead, you should fear what you do.'' \n \n `` Colorless? So does that mean I really have no vision?'' \n \n `` On the contrary, you have them all. Your eyes are darker than mine.'' It erupted into a laughter. \n \n `` Are my eyes black?'' \n \n `` Bravo. Now, I'm going to get you out of this, so sit back and watch.'' \n \n The experience that followed was surreal. There are n't enough words to describe it. I was ripped from my body and replaced by It. When I looked down, I saw an equally disgusting black apparition. I looked up again to see a chord holding my current form to my body. \n \n `` Ah, I've missed having a body.'' \n \n And at that moment, My body's eyes turned purple and my mother shed a tear. \n \n `` It seems he must have had a delayed reaction.'' My father sighed in complete relief. \n \n They both made their way downstairs, happy to get back to their business. They were so ecstatic they forgot about the giant hole they left in my bedroom. \n \n `` Think about your eyes being purple and they will remain purple.

The digital window into this unseen world was overflowing with heavily saturated blobs of human figures, some warmer than others but all filled with a topographical gradient of red, yellow, blue, and green. I cradled the camera in my arm as I closed my eyes for a moment before opening them again. Unsurprisingly, nothing changed. \n \n There were no indicators in my naked field of vision of where these figures resided. No rustling of tree branches, no leaves crunching, no difference in the environment at all until the thermal view unveiled their existence. I opened the portal again by bringing the camera up to eye level to inspect further. There was nothing to be scared of, no threats to be seen. My heart was not pounding, and my lungs continued to passively exchange the damp forest air with my own. The figures continued to slowly shuffle through the foot-trodden path in the woods. Regardless of the direction their bodies were moving, all seemed to stare in the same direction as I was heading. \n \n Continuing on, I kept the camera pointed ahead to use their fixed gaze as a compass. What were they staring at? After a few minutes of a steady pace, the muscles in my legs began to cramp, beads of sweat forming along my forehead. It was n't warm out, I should not be this exhausted. I kept moving forward. One of the figures beckoned to me from inside the viewfinder. They waved their arm as a motion to quicken my pace, and I complied. \n \n The air started to feel heavy, a moist blanket weighing down my limbs. My scalp was dripping, but my mouth was dry. What was happening? \n \n I needed to rest. The colorful blobs near the tree to my right parted the way as I turned to face it. The camera fell out of my hands as my fingers stiffened, bouncing on the wet leaves and landing safely with the screen still on. \n \n The bark felt spectacular against my weary back as I propped myself up against the wide trunk. I pulled my left leg next to my right and stretched them out in front of me, wiping away the moisture from the camera screen before setting it on my lap. I could see the legs and feet of the others still shuffling along the forest, but my own extremities remained unregistered. I would have found it strange, if I was n't too tired to care. \n \n With every blink, the effort to open my eyelids increased. The figures on the screen that were closest to me turned to face where I was sitting as they dropped to their knees and bowed their heads in my direction. Rest was needed. Rest was now.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Addictive new video game is a secret government drone program .\n","story":"The first time I'd heard of *Arabian Amulets* was the morning of my church's youth summer camp. I'm not much of a facebooker; that was a bit too `` old people'' for me, but I wanted to let my family know that I was on my way upstate for two weeks. All over my feed were status updates: Grandma had unlocked Map 312, Uncle John was giving Dad ten free daily amulets. \n \n At first I'd thought it was another online game, like *Candy Crush* or *Farmville*. So I had n't given it a second thought when I loaded my bags onto the church bus and settled in next to my friends. Immediately, though, they all began pulling out their phones and tuned the world out. Usually we would chat and play card games and sing for the six-hour trip, but the bus was dead silent as we drove off, save for the occasional beeps and chimes. \n \n After a half hour of silence, I finally gave in and asked my friend Britt, `` what are you all playing?'' \n \n `` *Arabian Amulets*,'' she replied flatly, not looking up from her game. `` It's fun; you should download it. Add me as a buddy so we both get fifty free amulets.'' Since it looked like I was going to be ignored for the foreseeable future, I looked it up on the Play Store. Already it had been downloaded over 50 million times in less than a week. How had I not heard of this game already? \n \n The game itself was quite simple. It was one of those number puzzles, where there was one open space in a grid, and you slid the mixed-up numbers around to put them in order. You got five puzzles a day, but could buy more with amulets you earned. Between signing up with my Facebook and being Britt's buddy, I already had 150 amulets. Of course, you could always purchase more amulets from their store. \n \n Once you got the numbers in the correct spot, the game switched to a seek-and-find puzzle. A cartoon map would be revealed, and you'd have just a few seconds to find an object on the map: a car, a certain house, whatever. Finding the object not only earned you amulets, but it also locked everyone else out of the map; only one player could ever solve a map. Most of the time, even if you found the object, you'd get a message saying something like, `` player 420blazeitxoxoxo claimed this map! Try again!'' \n \n The first puzzle I completed took a long time. I had n't played anything like it since I was a kid, so I ran out of time with just a few tiles out of place. The second puzzle I finished in the knick of time, but could n't find the object in time. The next few puzzles I found the object, But the maps had already been claimed. \n \n After about an hour of this, I finally earned my own map. Here's how it happened. I'd solved my puzzle quickly, enough to earn a five-second bonus on the seek-And-find portion. The cartoon was of what appeared to be a courtyard in a large stretch of desert. There were dozens of stereotypical Arabic people who looked like they were having a party: belly dancing women, swarthy men in gold chains and sunglasses. I had ten seconds to find a wedding cake, which was easy enough. I tapped on it, and my screen flashed. `` Congratulations Player Stef_the_giraffe_101! You've earned your first map!'' But then something weird happened: the cartoon map turned into a grainy black-and-white video for about a second. I could see people -- real people, not cartoons -- dancing. There were kids running about, even though there had n't been kids in the cartoon. The video seemed to zoom in rapidly on the wedding cake I'd found, then... nothing. My screen went blank. \n \n I restarted the app, and It booted up as if nothing had happened. I'd been credited 20 amulets. It must've been a bug, I thought. It was a new app; maybe it was still being developed. \n \n The whole thing had slipped my mind during church camp. I never managed to unlock another map, And after a week I'd grown tired of the game. By the time I'd arrived back home, most of my friends had moved on to the next popular app. \n \n My parents were watching the news when I got home. After hugs and discussing how camp had been, my dad carried my bags to my room while my mom worked on dinner. I was n't really paying attention to the TV until I heard the anchor mention that the US government was being criticized for another drone bombing. For whatever reason, I could n't turn away. There, on the news, I watched as they played a video clip of the drone footage. At first, it seemed to circle above a busy city, not really doing anything. Then it suddenly zoomed in on a group of people, about 30 or so. Then I watched as the black-and-white video feed continued to zoom in rapidly, then cut to black as the shape of a wedding cake cane into view.\n"}

Tell us how we would perceive you based on your features , from the way you walk to the features of your face .\n","story":"She walks with her head down as if she's afraid the ground might open up beneath her and swallow her. Her short, red colored hair illuminated in the sunlight. She looks up for a second, scans her surroundings then looks back to the ground, avoiding eye contact with anyone at all costs. But those eyes, when she does look at someone, she sees straight into them. They lose their breath, like they are actually drowning in the deep blue. Her expression sad, lonely, like a lost dog searching for a home. She takes short strides dragging her feet. She ca n't be more than five feet and three inches. Hands stuck in her pockets of her half zipped batman jacket, fiddling with something. She pulls out her hand and starts biting her nails. Im assuming its a habit, because once she notices she's ripping and biting off her skin, she quickly puts her hands back into her pockets. \n Her shoes are an old pair of DCs, laced like running shoes, but with holes near the feet that open and close when she walks, telling a story of where she's been... Although I already know wheres she's been... Usually she's in sweat pants, but today she's wearing dark blue skinny jeans. She moves her hair behind her ears and puts in ear buds to drain out the sounds of the people around her, talking and laughing about the parties, classes, and other people walking by. How can people be so judgmental? She finally makes it to the bus stop. She stands still, with her hip cocked to one side, only looking up to see if the bus is near by. She sits down, hunched over as though she just ca n't muster up the strength to sit upright. Her hands rummaging through her purse to eventually pull pull out her iPhone. A smile starts to form, her thin lips curling upward, causing her eyes to squint a little. God, I love when she smiles. \n Her body is n't overweight, but she's not skinny, but because she is short, any weight that she does put on is noticeable. But I think she's perfect... Why ca n't I just talk to her? As she moves her hair behind her ear again, I see that she has four earrings in each ear. As I study her more, from her jaw line down to her neck, she has a dermal on her left collarbone and a scar from where the right one used to be. Her black tank top under her jacket making her large breasts noticeable. Men walk by, studying every girl they see. Some look past her, others stop and stare as they pass. Sometimes she notices, and smiles, other times she quickly averts her gaze. Why ca n't she see she's beautiful? What is she so afraid of? She pulls her jacket closer to her as she sees the bus. She paces while waiting for the bus to come closer like she's in some kind of a hurry. She gets up, pulls her jacket down around her hips, and begins to walk towards the bus. Others crowd the bus like a celebrity is about to step foot off of it. She waits patiently, while people push past each other to get a seat. Her round face becoming agitated, her sinister looking eyebrows move as she rolls her eyes. Finally she's shuffled her way to the bus entrance. She grabs the guard rail with her sleeve over her hand, maybe to keep the germs off or to hide her barely bleeding fingers from the picking. She stares out the window of the bus. Her expression still tense, but relaxes and smiles as she sees a woman walking her dog. Why must I always admire her from the sidelines?\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Two god-like beings , disguised as old men , play a game of chess on a park bench to decide the final fate of humanity . The players , however , are distracted by a couple seated across them ...\n","story":"One would believe that the development of a multiverse is akin to mitosis, multiplying constantly and encouraging growth. That is wrong. The reality of the situation is that all of the multiverse simply *was* at the beginning, and has always been in a state of deterioration. If you had to make a metaphor, compare the multiverse to a brain and then each individual universe to a neuron flickering away. Slowly yet definitely, the multiverse will at one point be gone forever. \n \n Other fun facts: one universe consists of one planet. You can not argue this unless you \u2019 ve met another conscious species from another planet. Consciousness is crucial in the management of a planet. Opposed, ethereal forces will seize upon specific universes and pass judgment upon them. One force is sustained by the existence of the multiverse and fights to preserve it. The other force feeds off of the dead matter of lost worlds. The forces can not fight each other directly, thus they manifest themselves into competitions of skill. \n \n On one planet, the overly dramatic forces staged and fought a hundred year war. Millions died at first, then as the population withered away the spectacle became an embarrassment. The preservers conceded to the feeders to put the whole ordeal behind them. After that moment, the forces presented themselves in microcosms of competition. A game of pong. An arm wrestling match. Rock paper scissors. A race to the porch and back. If the feeders won, the universe was obliterated. It became a quick, entertaining procedure for both sides. \n The fate of one particular world rested on a preserver wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants drinking soda out of a two-liter bottle and a feeder wearing a vest over a turtleneck in seventy degree weather. He sweated profusely as he set up a chessboard. \n \n \u201c I prefer checkers, \u201d the preserver said as he reached into his grocery bag and pulled out a bagel. \n \n The feeder looked over to his ancient rival, \u201c We agreed upon chess. If I had it my way, we would be deciding matters over a game of tennis. \u201d The preserver laughed, picking at his food, \u201c I \u2019 m not running back and forth in this weather. You can eat this world and twenty more like if I had to play sports. \u201d \n \n The feeder sighed and sat across the preserver, \u201c Let \u2019 s not talk. Your appearance and demeanor is repugnant. \u201d The manifestations of the opposed forces has become its own psychological game; the preserver and feeder distract one another with averse depictions; the preservers grow uglier to the distaste of the feeder, and the feeder becomes more vain to throw the preserver off tilt. \n \n The game began. After the preserver \u2019 s first move, the feeder studied the board. In their ancient feud spanning across a vast amount of time and space, the preservers and feeders never invested too much time into learning one particular game well. The world \u2019 s best chess player can probably outplay any player from the multiverse; ironically, a chess grandmaster can think fifty moves ahead of their opponent, yet could not begin to comprehend the true form of a preserver or feeder without their brain pouring out of their nose. \n \n The feeder moved his pawn and began to observe the other chess players at the park and the rest of the world \u2019 s inhabitants. There was a college nearby, so many co-eds were bouncing all over the place catching frisbees. Dogs ran rampant after other dogs with sticks in their mouths. Children clung to monkeybars, kicking at the void under their undeveloped legs. The feeder did not have to justify his actions to the preserver, but he did appreciate the world \u2019 s he would feast on. Many were exactly the same, and the feeder could watch the duplicate of the same child grow big and strong while the feeder day after day ate his worlds one after another. \n \n The preserver moved a piece. Then the feeder went. The preserver burped. The feeder sipped on a ten dollar bottle of water that he retrieved from his messenger bag. The two stared at each other in resentment as the battle raged. \n \n The preserver saw an opportunity for a possible checkmate. As he moved his piece, a kickball hit the table, sending the chess pieces across the floor. The preserver and feeder stared at the board and one another as they fought to remember what the protocol was for a disrupted game. A young woman with dark, tight brown curls wearing a shirt and shorts attractively too tight on her flashed the two men a quick, unapologetic frown. \u201c I \u2019 m sorry! I have terrible aim. \u201d The feeder and preserver saw that two teams were waiting impatiently for the girl to retrieve the ball so their own game could resume. \n \n The feeder began to put the pieces back on the table, unaware exactly which piece went where to continue: \u201c It \u2019 s okay. Just a game, after all. \u201d The girl smiled, took her ball back and mouthed *sorry* to the men before she left. Both men watched her return to her friends before they turned on each other. \n \n \u201c I should have won, \u201d the preserver testified. \n \n \u201c Nonsense. You just believed you were winning, \u201d the feeder retorted. They smiled at each other, understanding that the game was a draw by default, yet the conflict must resolve. \n \u201c Chess is boring. What else can we play? \u201d \n \n \u201c We could gamble on the kickball game. \u201d \n \n They turned their attention to the undergrads whom played with a severity that only rears itself through recreational sports. The teams battered each other with the red rubber ball. The players ran at the bases hard. Feeder asked the brunette who was winning. She thought for a moment and then had to ask someone else. \u201c I think we are, but we aren \u2019 t really keeping score. \u201d \n \n The two men sat in the grass, drinking soda and water, watching young adults play a children \u2019 s game. The fate of the universe, pulled in one way by the voracious maw of the feeder and the other by the firm grasp of the preserver, rested upon which of these athletes approached them first and told them who won. \n\n"}

He would pay off his loans and his credit cards and perhaps still have enough to go into debt once more and pay it off yet again. All those days of living by the dollar had finally paid off. Charlie kissed the ATM, then spat as it shot a one hundred-dollar bill into his mouth. \n \n He threw himself back on his bed and sighed, listening to the machine crank out his payment. Gears creaked and ground against each other, screeching under the effort, but those sounds were the chorus of paradise for all Charlie cared. He watched each bill flutter from the emission slot, joining the rest in a mess on the floor. This would take a while: 700 thousand bills was... a lot. Charlie yawned and rested his head onto his pillow, the fluttering bills mesmerizing him into sleep. \n \n Charlie awoke to the largest, greenest Benjamin Franklin memorial pressing down upon him. He struggled to get up, but could n't move. During his sleep, the machine had spit more bills than PBS throughout the'90s, and they'd piled into a humungous ball of money that occupied the entire room. Its full mass was now bearing down on Charlie, slowly choking the air from his lungs. \n \n He tried to shift his arms and legs, but nothing budged. The money above him refused to yield to the craning of his neck as well. To think that a promise of financial freedom had turned into this green-walled prison so quickly. Charlie forced his lip upwards to scream, but to no avail: bills began to fall into his mouth, prickling his tongue with their leathery surfaces. *At least*, he thought, as his senses began to shut down, *they had n't been quarters*.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Something has been watching you and following you your whole life . You are full at aware but never told anyone because they would think you were crazy . It has never tried to talk to you or harm you , but today you finally try to see what it wants .\n","story":"I could always feel it. Corner of your eye, presence in the corner type stuff. As a child it was just like a really vivid imaginary friend, but at some point in your childhood you learn to be afraid of things. It was one of the first things that I became afraid of. I'm sure it caused my parents some frustration, as there were days where I would just break down in tears. I learned not to talk about it later. At that point the fear got split, half for The Presence, and half for people looking at me weird for being afraid of, from their perspective, nothing. A few years later i started to resent it. It was just THERE! All the time. It took me 3 tries to lose my virginity cause I swear i could feel it MORE during that time. Hell, once I'm pretty sure it saved my life. Not The Presence so much directly. It was college, and I was getting REALLY drunk. I was young and thought I could keep going. And that's when I realized I DID N'T feel it. I'd been pretty sloshed before and still felt it ( did n't care as much when drunk tho ) but at that moment I did n't. So that was when i stopped drinking for the night. I still wound up in the hospital for alcohol poisoning. \n Anymore, The Presence is just....part of life. It's just THERE. I try to ignore it and move on with my life. It's affected a few of my decisions though. I went skydiving just to see if it could keep up. Also did a brief desert trek. Still there. Those kind of upset me, but they were also both amazing experiences. \n That's how things have been for the past few years. Until today. Today, a package showed up from Amazon that I did n't order. Not such a big deal, it could have been a present. It was n't. Inside was a Ouji board, or something like it. This was hand carved and had a different layout. The little letter selector was replaced by a handful of numbers. The shipping label had something in the note section.'We need to talk.' \n I was a fair bit shocked. Some of the child's fear returned, but the adult mind suppressed it. The thought went that anything that wanted to talk probably did n't mean harm. Besides, the lion share of my mind was taken up by one thing: curiosity. \n \n I put the board on the coffee table and made sure all the numbers were face up. Then thinking about it I dead-bolted my door. I sat back down at the couch and realized that the numbers had already moved. It said simply: HI. \n I tried moving the numbers to say hello ( I was gon na put 3 and 4 on L ) but when I reached for them they moved to say YOU TALK \n `` Um....hello.'' The numbers moved again, spelling out PAPER That seemed pretty reasonable actually so I grabbed a pencil and paper. When i came back all the numbers where in blank sections, but started to move. The clear preference was to spell out whole words or several smaller words. The first thing The Presence asked was not to interrupt while it was `` talking'' which seemed pretty reasonable. I was also more focused on writing it down correctly and then going over it again anyway. Then we got underway. \n ASK. I KNOW YOU WANT TO \n `` So....what are you?'' \n I GET YOUR BODY AFTER YOU DIE. \n That threw me. Fear got the best of me on that one. `` Are....are you going to kill me?'' I was scared of the answer, cause my whole life this thing had been present and I knew I could n't outrun it or flee or anything. Rationally my best chance was to convince it not to if anything. It's response was quick and almost emotional. \n NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! I CA N'T HURT YOU AT ALL. \n Huge amounts of tension slipped out of my shoulders. Then i read the line that triggered the fear and I was back to curiosity. \n `` So then what do you mean after I die?'' \n YOU WILL DIE AT SOME POINT BUT YOUR BODY WILL LIVE. I WILL TAKE OVER YOUR BODY AND CONTINUE YOUR LIFE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE FOLLOWED YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE. SO I KNOW HOW TO BE YOU. \n That was....unnerving. `` What about my friends and family?'' \n THEY WO N'T HAVE TO MOURN OR HURT. I WILL BE YOU AS MUCH AS IS POSSIBLE. SOME WILL NOTICE SUBTLE CHANGES BUT WILL BLAME IT ON WHAT THEY VIEW AS A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. \n That was weird but also very comforting. I loved my parents and I knew that if I died before them they would be crushed. `` So, why tho?'' \n IT IS JUST HOW MY KIND LIVE. THAT IS THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU FOR THAT. \n That....seemed pretty reasonable actually. This thing may not even know. I sure did n't know why some things were the way they were. \n `` Why did n't you just tell me before now then?! I would n't have been so freaked out!'' Some strain came into my voice on that. \n WE ARE NEVER TO INTERACT WITH YOUR KIND. I AM CLEARLY BREAKING THAT RULE NOW. \n `` Why are you breaking the rule now after 25 years then? Why is now so special?'' \n The presence paused for a bit. BECAUSE SOON YOU WILL DIE. \n I was stunned as soon as I read it. I almost did n't realize It had continued. I KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AND HOW AND WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIME REMAINING. \n Lots of emotions were at war within me at that moment. `` Can... can I avoid it?'' \n YOU WO N'T. IT and again there was a noticeable pause IT WILL BE A CHOICE YOU MAKE. AT THE MOMENT YOU WILL KNOW IT WILL END YOU AND YOU WILL CHOOSE IT ANYWAY. IT IS A GOOD DEATH.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Twinkle , twinkle , little star , how I wonder what you are . Up above the world so high , falling swiftly from the sky ...\n","story":"I loved the feeling of the cool night air from my open window. I was leaning against my windowsill, staring up at the stars, softly singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. I focused my attention on a certain star, the biggest one that I could see. But as I repeated the song, staring at the star, I realized it was... growing *bigger*. Bigger and bigger, until its light illuminated my entire room. And then the light rapidly dimmed, dulling out to a smooth glow, leaving a humanlike figure in its wake. The figure stood, or floated rather, directly outside my window, and then a gentle voice rang out: `` Hello? Where am I?'' \n \n I did n't know what to say, how to react, or whether this was a dream. The words had left my mouth nearly before I realized it: `` This is my room.'' \n \n `` It's nice,'' the voice murmured. The figure edged closer, and its features sharpened until I could make out what it was: a girl. She looked like an ordinary girl, about my age, except she was kind of blueish gray, and glowing. I was hardly confused, just mesmerized. I decided to just speak, discover who this was. Maybe I could make a new friend. `` Who are you? What's your name? How did-'' \n \n My questions were interrupted by the girl's small giggle. `` You ask a lot of questions. My name's Ella, and I'm an angel. I did n't wan na stay up in the sky,'cause it was boring, so I came down here. What's your name?'' \n \n `` I'm Devon, and I'm seven. I did n't know angels were real, do a lot of angels leave the sky?'' \n \n `` Devon?'' Mom's voice came from the other side of the bedroom door. `` Who are you talking to?'' \n \n I gasped in horror, would Mom like Ella? Would Ella like Mom? I looked to the angel for answers, and she smiled. I wanted to say something, but nothing was coming from my half-open mouth; so I called back, `` Um...'' I wondered if I should tell Mom the truth. She smiled again, broader this time, and nodded gently. I took it as a verification and continued, `` An angel. She's my new friend.'' \n \n `` What? What are you talking about, honey?'' Mom opened my door while halfway through her inquiry, and looked at me quizzically. \n \n `` Right here, her name's Ella! She's really pretty, is n't she?'' I looked to the angel, who could have been blushing, but for a lack of skin color only grinned sheepishly. I heard her murmur something like, `` Well thank you...'' \n \n `` Who?'' My mom's voice reached my ears again. It was my turn to be confused; she saw Ella, did n't she? She had to. Ella was n't invisible. I shrugged it off, excusing my mom's ignorance with her bad hearing. `` Ella,'' I repeated. `` She's an angel, from the sky.'' I added a smile at the end for good measure. \n \n `` Oh...'' My mom trailed off for a few seconds. `` Well...'' she continued, oddly avoiding my gaze, but also not looking at Ella. `` I-I just wanted to tell you that, er, you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, so you should get a good night's sleep.'' \n \n `` Oh, ok!'' I replied cheerily. I was ok with that, even if it was a shorter notice than usual. I turned to Ella. `` Maybe we can talk again tomorrow. Is that ok?'' \n \n She smiled once again and gave a tiny nod, though the smile looked smaller, not as happy as the previous ones. And as she backed away, out of my window, I could swear I saw a flicker of sadness in her blue-gray eyes. \n\n"}

Chains clinked as it shifted position, flared its fins as far as the power lines would allow it, and then settled back into position. \n \n I refused to meet its gaze, as always, and hurried home. It was a necessary part of life in the city, I knew. The electrifish produced enough electricity just by living to power an entire city, and it was certainly a cleaner option than the antiquated sources of coal and oil that our ancestors used. \n \n And yet, I could n't get those eyes out of my head.

For a moment, I thought I understood the emotion in those fathomless eyes. \n \n Love.\n"}

My first thought is that it was a fire alarm, and that people were running for the exits. So I did the same. I grabbed some of the papers I was working on and made a break for an exit. I was expecting to see my fellow co-workers running towards the exit as well. Instead I was greeted by one of them charging at my with a shiv made out of an office scissor.

Instead I saw all my new co-workers stabbing each other with scissors and paper clips that had been bent and sharpened and put in between ones fingers as a makeshift knuckle duster. Some with rulers that had the edge sharped and used as a spear. Others forgot about the office supply warfare and started to kick, bite, scratch and punch there way out.

I was not about to kill a person, so I kept on running. Yet she would n't give. She tackled me forcing me to land on my back and causing the pencil to dig deeper into my skin. I yelled out and she was ready to stab me in the throat. I still had the scissor shiv in my hand and I knew I had to fight back. She went at my with the pencil and I hit her hand with my own. The point grazed the side of my neck. She was open. With my other hand I lunged at her with the scissor shiv, striking her right in her throat. She screamed but there was no sound to it. I moved her off of me with the sharp pain still in my back. I stood up, breathing hard. I looked around once more and saw the fighting had stopped.

I must have been deep in thought because the line stopped I bumped into the man in front of me.

I quickly muttered my apologies, careful not to look up into his eyes. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s all right, \u201d he said. His voice was calm, mellow and a little drawl. He was from the south originally, I presumed. \u201c Say, you look right nervous. \u201d \n \n I nodded, my eyes haltingly making their way up, his chest, broad and muscled from years of lifting weights; his neck, a grizzled scar that ran from the adams apple to the jugular; his scruffy unshaven chin, dimpled in the center; his cheeks, sharp and defined with high cheek bones; his eyes, gray and soft. I didn \u2019 t recognize him. This was a big place and it was not unheard of, I guess, to meet someone new every now and then. He wasn \u2019 t new, that was for sure.

The soup, or at least I thought it was soup, it could have been extremely lean stew, was not filling.

Sprawling on the rug before the fire, playing silly card games I hadn \u2019 t played since I was a kid, eating the wonderful things she baked herself, talking and talking and talking. \n \n Finally being forced by hunger from the bubble we had created, we \u2019 d come into the kitchen, where again, she cooked. A wonderful breakfast of pancakes and fruit and then a steaming pot of freshly ground and brewed coffee; the kitchen came to life, using this vision for a beating heart. \n \n I brought myself back to the present moment and stared at the woman I had seen in the yard beside mine for years, never thinking much of. She was merely my neighbour, and I merely a self-absorbed twat. Quite often a drunk twat. I shook my head, smiling, beaming! \n \n What a woman! What a night! \n\n"}

He pointed out the things that were the same, I explained some of the things that were different. There had obviously been a few tenants between him and I, and some of them were neither kind nor proud home-keepers.

This building is actually quite old, when it was being constructed the owner intended to have this entire floor to himself. Alas, he went bankrupt and the building was handed over mid-construction. The new landlord had a family mansion outside the city and divided the rooms on this floor into individual apartments. There was one room, with only one doorway and no windows, that would not fit properly with any apartment without requiring a redesign. Thus, the door was locked and the entrance \u2013 it had a little ante-chamber, probably a cloakroom originally \u2013 was converted into your bathroom. Shall I show you? \u201d \n \n > \u201c Of course!

Part of the wall shuddered and swung backwards, cracking the paint along the frame of the concealed door. Part of it was obscured behind the shower, he was n't surprised he had n't noticed it previously in the cramped bathroom. \n \n > John led me in. \u201c Be careful, \u201d he said, \u201c there's spider webs everywhere. And watch that dead mouse. \u201d \n \n > The room, as John had said was surprisingly spacious. There was some faint light flickering in through cracks here and there, just enough to get a sense of the room but not to make out details. John went to get a torch while I looked around blindly in the musty air, wondering how I could have failed to notice the room and when asbestos was commonly used in homes. John came back in and handed me the torch. \n \n > \u201c Wow. This place is pretty cool. I guess you got up to a lot in here, eh? \u201d \n \n > \u201c Yes, actually.

The people, five girls and four boys. Or perhaps it was the other way around, time has a knack of robbing the little details like that. Look, \u201d he dashed out of the beam of light momentarily before bobbing back in, \u201c here's one, Gloria I think her name was. \u201d He was clutching a putrefied, severed head, mummified from the dry, dark heat of twenty years. \u201c She offered me head when I was out walking with my daughter, who was about 4 at the time. So I took it. \u201d He chuckled at his own wit. I stood paralysed. \n \n > \u201c Here, point the torch at the centre of the floor. \u201d I obeyed mechanically. There was a large, dark, uneven stain covering the wooden floor. \u201c That's where I did it. They could cry for help all they want, none of the neighbours would do anything, and I liked to hear them scream. It was the most exhilarating feeling, to hear them cry and swear and pray to a God who had abandoned them since birth. And the smell! \u201d he chattered excitedly, looking like a child on Christmas morning, moving his hands with the long, bloody locks still held fast inside, \u201c The smell, my dear boy, was the best part. You can never imagine what it is like to be able to smell the pure terror exuding from someone's body, to taste the blood in the air as they live their last, to inhale in air that was never exhaled but borne free by the knife's edge... \u201d \n \n > He pulled out the knife that I had left on the table by the door and turned to me. The blade momentarily caught the torch light, gleaming steel conclusion into my eye. He let the head drop with a soft, sickening thud. \u201c I would really like to thank you Jonathan, \u201d he said as he advanced, knife poised like a cobra, \u201c for allowing me into your home.

The intensity of the sound made me pause. Seems like more prisoners got out than I thought. I flipped the safety on the side of my stun gun off and resumed jogging toward the uproar. The soles of my boots rang out as they struck the steel floor. \n \n \n Static buzzed in my ear for a moment. Comms were online. I pressed a forefinger on the side of my helmet. `` Devons. Talk to me.'' \n \n \n `` Looks like eight prisoners causing trouble in the main hall. Take this next right.'' Kicking my pace up a notch, I followed my fellow warden's instructions and rounded the corner, bracing myself for a rough confrontation. \n \n \n I dashed into the open hall and readied my weapon. A group of hulking prisoners stood on a landing above me, howling at the top of their lungs and pounding the walls. `` Hey!'' I hollered up at them, `` What are you lowlifes doing out of your cells?'' At the sound of my voice, the rioters froze. One of them, a muscular, bald-headed oaf crossed his arms and walked toward the edge to face me. He grinned, showing a mouthful of gnarled and bent teeth, with plenty missing to show for himself. \n \n \n `` Well, look who finally turned up. Just one guard, all on his own? Bullpen, if you will?'' He turned his gaze upwards, behind me. My head whipped around, but before I could react, a stone-faced, hairy wall of a man crashed down from above, blocking my exit. Standing at least a head taller than me, the man bore a heavy resemblance to a certain North American Sasquatch. As much as this giant unnerved me, I knew I could n't show the convicts any weakness. I kept my stun gun pointed squarely at the leader, but he stared me down as if I held a featherduster. \n \n \n Devon's voice buzzed in my ear. `` What's going on, York? Do you have the situation under control?'' \n \n \n Bullpen's head jolted at my colleague's voice. Grabbing me by the skull, he wrested the helmet away from me and stomped it into the ground with a gut-wrenching *crunch*. Bullpen smirked, looking into my eyes for a reaction. Unfazed, I stepped up to the leader and shoved the end of my stun gun into his ugly mug. `` This is your last warning,'' I said, struggling to keep my voice level, `` Back off.'' \n \n \n Baldy raised his eyebrows. `` Oh, look, boys. The pig thinks he can squeal us into submission.'' A chorus of forced guffaws erupted among the gang. Baldy held up a quick hand signal and the other thugs leapt over the railing and began to fill in a circle around me. I had to act fast. \n \n \n Wasting no time, I fired at a goon and nailed him midair as he fell to the first floor. Ducking under a palm thrust from Ol' Bullpen, I fired point blank into his exposed side. As he lost consciousness and began to topple, I ducked under his arm and jabbed him into another prisoner with my elbow. They both fell to the floor with a satisfying *boom*, and I twisted around to fire at the remaining men. Got one, got -- \n \n \n `` Gaaagh!'' \n \n \n The slimeball on the ground had kicked out my right leg! Seeing me off balance, Baldy rushed forward and tried to tackle me. I got a shot off into his chest before having to roll to the side, into the center of the hall. Clutching at his heart, Baldy swung an enormous fist at me. I hopped to the side and slammed my gun into the top of his arm, sending him crashing to the ground. A thug behind me clipped me on the side of the head, and I twisted to shoot him down. Before I could recover, someone leapt from behind me and clung onto my right arm. My fingers slipped and the stun gun slid a few feet out of my grasp as I was brought to the ground. I punched my assailant in the face, but he managed to hold me down to the floor by the shoulders. A crazed look in his eyes, he spat into my face and yelled out to the others, `` Got'im! Got'im!'' \n \n \n I struggled as much as I could, but these prisoners were in surprisingly good shape. Baldy wobbled to his feet, laughing hysterically. `` Ooh, put up a *bit* of a fight there, did we?'' He bent down and snatched my lost weapon from the ground. `` Let's see here... turn up the... voltage.'' He twisted a dial to the max, the gun humming loudly. \n \n \n `` Nice try, piggy,'' the man said with a toothy grin, `` but it's going to take a *lot* more than you to keep us in here.'' He pressed the gun into the side of my head and I let out an involuntary gasp. Those members of the gang still conscious looked down on me from all sides.

He hated Monday meetings. `` It appears that our weekly shipment has been delayed again,'' he said deferentially to the woman sitting on the stone throne in front of him. \n \n Katrina Albritton leaned forward, one hand under her chin. `` So you're saying that we have n't received any --'' \n \n `` Souls, no, ma'am. Not for three weeks.'' \n \n Katrina frowned. Ever since [ she had initiated her hostile takeover of the underworld in the name of Global Amalgamated ] ( https: \/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WritingPrompts\/comments\/3brjqp\/wp_a_man_has_lived_his_whole_life_sinfully_with\/cspikhx ), her self-described `` crash course in corrupted divinity'' had focused on one thing: souls that were judged unworthy of eternal happiness in heaven were cast down to Hell. And, as per some sort of unwritten agreement between God and Lucifer -- who at this point was missing, presumably still licking his wounds from the takeover -- the souls were typically cast down en masse, barring the occasional extraordinary soul that was `` expressed'' straight down ( this was how Katrina got there ). And, more often than not, this happened on Tuesdays. \n \n Katrina still had no idea why Hell ran on a Julian calendar, but she did n't really care. `` So if we're not receiving any souls... where are they going?'' \n \n Caillou shrugged. `` I honestly do n't know, ma'am. New Jersey?'' \n \n Katrina's subsequent response was drowned out by a thunderous booming noise, the echoing of some sort of unholy bell. Caillou looked up at the sound as it repeated once, twice. `` That's the arrival bell,'' he said in puzzlement. `` Maybe He got backed up and caught us up all at once.'' \n \n `` Go check on it, please.'' \n \n `` Certainly.'' Caillou nodded and abruptly disappeared in a small puff of smoke and flame, while Katrina turned her attention to a piece of parchment on her lap -- her to-do list. Lucifer had been a fairly effective ruler, but Katrina had already identified several areas where he could have been more hands-on with his management -- \n \n Caillou suddenly reappeared in front of her, this time accompanied by two winged creatures and a large iron container of some sort. `` Um...'' he began. `` Yeah... we've got a problem.'' \n \n Katrina looked up, as one of the demons reached into the container and pulled out... a handful of envelopes. Even she was surprised by that. `` Mail,'' she finally said after a few seconds. `` We get mail. In *Hell. *'' \n \n `` Never have before, ma'am,'' Caillou said. `` But this is n't normal mail.'' He plucked a single envelope from the handful the demon was holding, swiftly opened it with a claw, and pulled out the paper within. ``'Dear Santa,''' he read, ``'I've been a good girl, honest, but Mom and Daddy are having problems and all I want for --''' \n \n Katrina held up a hand. `` Hold it.'' She pointed at the container. `` You're saying that --'' She paused, trying to hold down a laugh. `` You're saying that we just received...'' \n \n She gave up and started laughing. `` *Letters to Santa Claus! *'' \n \n Caillou merely nodded, and waited for the laughing to subside.

We were together all those years ago, and while I know that it changed some part of me, I still feel like things ended up the way they were supposed to. \n \n But my Bobby, there's nothing else for him but me. And me for him.'' \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n I woke up that day feeling... tired. It was well past my fourtieth birthday, and most of those years without seeing a free human. You see, we humans lost the war when I was very young, and since then we'd been kept as pets by our new masters. \n \n They were n't robots, per-se, they were sentient beings that operated on an entirely different level than us tried-and-true meatbag humans. \n \n Most of the bots you saw now were multipurpose models, built and grown in vast factories, robots building robots. But in the early days, the first bots were those that were willing to sacrifice everything to become more -- some called them courageous, I just called them insane. They melded their minds with the circuitry, injecting their humanity into the machine strata. \n \n Of course their efforts were spectacular failures at first, but sooner than seemed plausible, there were bots walking around with the souls of people in them. Once they figured out how to perfect the process, and take advantage of their new hardware, the war was on. \n \n Humanity had a choice then, stay natural, or join themselves to the botsphere. The naturals were people like my parents; proud, independent. Or maybe foolish. \n \n Looking back now I see that they made the choice for me, as parents often do even without realizing it. \n \n They made short work of us, slaughtered or detained most of the adults, and put the rest of us in what might pass for a zoo. To us, it was a prison. And as a child, imagination was plentiful but means were scarce. \n \n They ended up domesticating us through isolation, as people -- not like the `` new'' people, but us old-style people -- as people we needed interaction, a social structure, teachers, co-conspirators. By isolating us they broke our will, took the wild parts out of us, convinced us to shake hands with the devil. \n \n But I'm different. I remember the time when we were whole, when we were free. I remember when we were still people. You see, my owner is a collector of antiquities. She has a turn of the century console in the basement, and when she's out doing bot business I sneak down and talk to other pets. We've uncovered some very important work, a cookbook, is what it calls itself, but there's not much about food inside. \n \n What it does talk about in detail is explosives, and my master will soon find out that her lifespan is n't much longer than mine, after all. \n \n\n"}

Humans were the latest species to advance to the Plasma Age of civilization, soaring the starry skies after great advancements made to space technology in what they called the `` late twenty-first century.'' \n \n Excruciatingly slow developers, or so they say, us humans took over two hundred thousand years to traverse outside the realms of our solar system. The `` plenipotentiaries'', or whatever that means, of the Exos Council of Universal Affairs deemed us safe to enter the space center after the `` necessary decontamination.'' \n \n I know what you're thinking - queue the weird probes. Not quite, but you know that feeling when you have a sore in your mouth and you ca n't stop tounging it? Imagine having that all the time. They called it an `` air regulator chip'' and I tried not to ask too many questions. Once we were issued `` standard linguistic ear chips'' and the higher ups had convened extensively I guess the time had come to go on board and discuss Earth's role in the future of the universe. \n \n Allen Good - that's me - mechanic on the ESS Enterprise, cared nothing for such politics. As a top spacial nuclear engineer recovering from a cataclysmically nasty divorce, I guess I was either bold enough or spurned by the world enough to embark on a tour without a definite return date. While the Caliph met with the other world leaders the crew was permitted to tour the space center with an assigned guide. I figured, why the hell not? It was an opportunity to sever the monotony that had infiltrated every aspect of the recent three month journey. \n \n Aliens of every species hustled and bustled around the place. Since sterilization took so long our first stop after administration was the cafeteria. Inexplicable masses of food in one line, air tanks and metal in another - overwhelming would be an understatement. Bodies like larva, tentacles, giant eyes - why could n't they all look like the oddly hot chick from Avatar? Jesus, there goes one of those prawn things from District 9. \n \n ``... led to the invention of the air regulator chip in eon 5.67, which is what is allowing everyone eat now instead of being encumbered by gas tanks and headgear.'' Said the guide, a stout, buggish creature with black shiny eyes and a bronze exoskeleton. \n \n We sat down to eat. The bug looked at me and said, `` You are an engineer yes? Please tell me about human inventions. What do you think is the best?'' \n \n As I pulled out my peanut butter and jelly sandwich I almost had a chuckle fit. Did aliens understand humor? Was this really the time and place? What harm could it even do if they did or did not? \n \n `` This, sliced bread.'' \n \n `` Sliced bread?'' The bug asked. \n \n I could n't contain my laughter. `` I'm only kidding. Us humans have a saying that when something is really good it is the'best thing since sliced bread.' Although now that I think of it, I have no idea why.'' \n \n His eyes swelled the size of balloons, almost bulging out of his sockets. He reminded me of one of those stress reliever squeeze dolls, only the rest of him that was n't bulging was hard and armored. \n \n `` We have not seen bread for several decades'' The bug said excitedly. He looked practically on the verge of ecstasy. Immediately a screen popped up in front of his face and script began typing out furiously. Several flashes later I managed to work out that my photo had been taken. The rest was history. Every TV screen and internal news feed around the world had the news within hours - bread was back. \n \n The bug, along with many of the bug like aliens I had seen, had one common ancestor - the weevil. After exhausting almost every bit of flour in existence bread ceased to exist throughout the galaxy. Weevils verged on the edge of extinction until a synthetic was made, but it was never quite the same. Now the existence of tasty bread was only a thing of stories. \n \n What a funny world is n't it? An abundance of wheat on Earth and subsequent monopoly allowed humans to become one the most powerful species in the universe in a matter of years. And I was there, Allen Good, to watch it all unfold. One thing still baffles me more than anything else though, still brings a hearty chuckle from me to this day. Do you know what they all had to ask? \n \n `` Why do you slice it?''\n"}

Although Mrs. Dunbar was frozen in the position she had taken moments before, her mind was racing as it had countless times when she had faced unexpected situations in the courtroom.

The moderator shuffled his papers in order to regain control of the situation, but before he could utter another word Mr. Underwood was ready with his response: \n \n \u201c Mrs. Dunbar, I applaud your bravery, \n But my flow and use of words is like lyrical slavery, \n Whatever anyone says I \u2019 ve been successful with AmWorks, \n Wait, what about you? Aren \u2019 t you just some law clerk? \u201d \n \n The crowd jumped to its feet, roaring in support of the exaggerated last two words by Underwood. He pumped his hands in the air and looked over at Dunbar with a smirk that she just couldn \u2019 t stomach. As the crowd quieted down, she responded: \n \n \u201c Please quiet down so I can respond to Mr. Underwood, \n But if this is supposed to be fair, then maybe a less intelligent person should? \n Misappropriates funds while endangering lives, \n Let \u2019 s all flip his ass off while you gim me high fives! \u201d \n \n With that, Dunbar immediately raised her middle finger while making her way around the roaring crowd. Hands came flying out to meet hers as she circled around the stage. After she had completed a full round, she made her way back to her podium and glared back up at Underwood. \n \n There was a smirk on his face. The battle had only begun. \n\n"}

When I brought it home, I ripped through the paper and saw that it was a new game. A free video game! I set up the game on my PC and instantly started playing. The character information popped up. There was an elf, a swordsman, and a magician. Being the magic-lover that I am, I chose the magician. I named her Aisha. She looked like a real person, with her brown eyes and blonde hair. Using the arrow keys, I veered Aisha to some gates, only to be stopped by some men who started lecturing me about the dangers that lurked outside, blah blah blah. I ignored them and stepped out of the gates. What I saw made my eyes bug out. There were lots of people, but what made me freeze was what they were doing. They were killing each other, either with a sword, a wand like mine, or a very sharp looking stick. Real looking blood was splattering every inch of the ground, and when a character died, they fell to the ground, screaming blood curdling murder. I spotted a group of people that were together as a murder team, who instantly starting coming towards Aisha. Terrified, I ran back to the gates, trying to get back inside the safe zone. As soon as I reached the opening, a invisible barrier thing blocked me, keeping me from coming inside. Turning around to face the group, I watched as they muttered,'' Another one, eh? That's too bad. Well, the less people there are, the better.'' One of them slashed at me with her knife, leaving a bloody scar on the side of my arm. I immediately dropped the controller, feeling a sudden ache in my left arm. I looked for a scar, like the one in my video game, but I found none. I watched helplessly as the team took turns slashing at me, each slash bringing a new painful scar in real life. I tried pleading and begging for them to stop, but they did n't listen. Then, a young boy, probably about 11, grinned at me and whispered, `` Good Night.'' Then everything went black.\n"}

It was a small mining and fishing village, with the vast Lake Jericho on the east docks, and the Krodar Mines to the west, in the edge of Mount Faito. He ran, whipping his stick about like a blade, round and round, swatting trees and swishing it through long grass. He was the age of eight, not yet old enough to join his father in the mines, or join his mother on the docks. He had short mousy hair, thin and straight like a pin. \n \n He spent his time in the schoolhouse on the south end of town, the head of which truly disliked him, since he couldn \u2019 t keep his attention on the mathematics classes. He loved history, the study of knights and knighthood, the interesting life of royalty. He knew he could never be in such a live, but it was a joy to think it. He did find mining and fishing interesting, but he felt like he was meant for more. \n \n \u201c Say my boy, do you happen to have a shilling? I haven \u2019 t eaten for days. \u201d Said a hoarse voice. As he looked to it, there was a man sitting on the ground by the inn. He had russet-brown skin and a long bushy grey beard. His clothes were ripped and dirty, as was his face and feet, covered in dry mud. He had a sweetened smile, with no lack of teeth, and small auburn eyes. Why, Theo did have a shilling.

Kira, the owner of the inn makes a great beef stew, with all sorts of succulent meat, carrots, potatoes... come come! \u201d Theo said. He had lots of time on his hands, and he wanted to do something nice. \n \n \u201c My, that \u2019 s very kind of you, young man. \u201d The man said again. \n \n \u201c My parents always taught me to help others.

Do you live near here? \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh, no, I \u2019 m not from around here. I travel a lot, I go to many cities. \u201d Kael replied. \n \n \u201c Like where?

I have, why do you ask? \u201d \n \n \u201c It just seems like a nice place, I \u2019 ve only heard stories. The knights, the nobles, it \n all seems so fancy. I wonder what it \u2019 s like over there. I \u2019 m happy being here though, my family works hard but we live a nice life. \u201d \n \n \u201c Has your family always lived here? \u201d \n \n \u201c No, they \u2019 re all over the place.

Theo questioned him about all sorts of towns, places, personalities. He was ever so curious, happily eating his stew while Kael ate as well. Kael seemed to cheer up gradually, asking him lots of questions about his family, his town, what kind of things he enjoyed and his favourite classes in school. \u201c You remind me a lot of myself when I was your age, young man. \u201d Kael said, nodding slowly. \n \n \u201c Are you staying here long? You seem to travel a lot. You know a lot about history, it \u2019 s my favourite class! I love hearing stories. \u201d \n \n Kael laughed, \u201c As do I, young man. \u201d Kael finished the last of his stew. \u201c This stew is delicious, you don \u2019 t taste such fresh food in the capital.

Might as well do something nice with it! \u201d Theo said happily. They slowly got up, and strolled out together, thanking Kira for the delicious stew. \u201c How long will you be around? \u201d Theo asked again. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m sorry Theo, but I \u2019 m afraid I must leave town for now. \u201d Kael said sullenly. \n \n \u201c Aw, you can \u2019 t!

Rushing home, he got there right as they arrived. \u201c Now, where were you young man? \u201d His father asked with a chuckle. \n \n \u201c I met an interesting man! He knew all sorts of history, but he travels, had to leave town today. He likes switching areas a lot, apparently. \u201d Theo said quietly, looking at the ground. \n \n \u201c Now now my boy, I \u2019 m sure he \u2019 ll be back one day. \u201d \n \n ***** \n \n \n One week later, a knock came to the Cullins \u2019 front door.

I pulled out the potions from the bag some green, some yellow, some red. I placed them carefully on the table 1 by 1 organizing them by type. \n \n I finished and admired my work. The sunlight shining though the window and the potions casting a rainbow of colors over the wall and me. It was amazing that the apothecary sold these to anyone, it was perfect. The assortment in front of me was massive: strength, health, poison, poison resistance, growth, invisibility, and the list goes on. `` Now they will see why they should have killed the rats.'' \n \n I walked to the cupboard and pulled out a large bowl. I walked back with a sinister grin on my face. I set the bowl on my table rattling the potions. Without a care for the type I began grabbing potions and pouring them into the bowl. The colors blended as the potions were all pour into the bowl. what once had been a rainbow of colors was now a sick black soup. \n \n I took a whiff of the soup my grin widening. I picked up the bowl and walked down into the basement. \n \n * * * \n \n The ravenous noise from the basement was ruining my sleep, 2 weeks had passed since I had made the soup and mutated the rats. Their anger and rage had not ceased since I gave it to them. In those weeks no hero had come to my house to ask for a quest, instead I'd been left with the giant killer rats I had created. \n \n Needing an escape I left the house and walked over to my neighbor's house. I knocked on the door and she answered with a quizzical look on her face, I never came to see her. `` Sooooo seen any Heros lately?'' \n \n `` The land is at peace, we do n't need heroes right now. Has been at peace for a few months now. Those last heroes who came through must have done something about the emperor.'' \n \n My jaw dropped. `` mother fuckers''\n"}

His birthday arrives just a few weeks after he moves in, and as soon as the cake is cut and the champagne bottle popped, they all drag chairs to the patio door and watch. On New Year \u2019 s Eve, John sets up the fireworks in the backyard while everyone else outside peers through the glass, trying to see the ball drop in 1963 on the tiny television set in the old couple \u2019 s kitchen. By the time St. Patrick \u2019 s Day rolls around, John \u2019 s buddies have devised a drinking game. Take a sip if the old lady is knitting. Another sip if her husband dozes off in the chair. Chug if she kicks him under the table to wake him. \n \n Easter weekend, Margot and her kids drive up from Indiana. Cold still clings to the air, but by Sunday morning the sun is shining, the grass brown but alive beneath patches of snow. John and Margot sit at the kitchen table, their chairs turned to the sliding glass doors, watching John \u2019 s nephews play in the yard through one door and the old couple host Easter brunch through the other. \n \n \u201c How old do you think they are? \u201d \n \n John shrugs, blowing on his coffee. \u201c I \u2019 d say\u2014seventies, maybe? There must be three generations out there. \u201d He squints, scanning the backyard through the slow-glass door. The skies are\u2014were\u2014cloudy in 1963, threatening rain, and yet at least thirty people are gathered outside, the ladies in dresses and elaborate hats and the men in shirts and ties. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t know. People got married and had kids a lot earlier in those days. \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 d still say seventies.

Eventually he buys a patio set at a garage sale and takes to eating dinner outside, grading math tests to the sound of crickets while Ethel knits and Fred combs through the newspaper. \n \n He doesn \u2019 t notice anything is wrong until a few days after it must have happened. Thunderstorms keep him inside for the better part of a week\u2014and though it means he gets to enjoy torrential downpours in one pane of glass and cloudless nights in the other, he misses his Fred and Ethel. Finally, on a Friday, the skies clear, and John spends the weekend outdoors, watching for the old couple. Soon, though, John realizes that Ethel is the only one home. \n \n She eats alone. She knits alone, fingers pausing now and then as her gaze drifts to the floor. A few days every week, a woman John recognizes from the Easter party shows up, bustling around the kitchen, washing dishes, chattering about something that draws the occasional halfhearted smile out of Ethel but little else. \n \n More and more often, Ethel \u2019 s eyes lift to the slow-glass. She and her husband never paid much attention to the sliding glass door\u2014John suspected early on that they had lived in the house for so many years that the slow-glass had become less of a marvel to them. But now, Ethel watches the glass the way she and Fred used to watch the *Andy Griffith Show*, hands idle in her lap, focus fixated on whatever view she has of the past. John gazes back at her, watching her eyes flicker. \n \n Fifty years back for her. 1913. \u201c How long have you lived here? \u201d John asks, trailing a finger down the glass. \u201c What do you see? \u201d \n \n In mid-June, John wanders out to the patio after dark and finds Fred and Ethel \u2019 s kitchen packed up in boxes. His heart sinks. On the last day of the month, John catches her with the final box from the kitchen in her arms, standing where the dinner table used to be. She looks at the slow-glass, and with a heavy sigh, says something. John can \u2019 t hear her, of course, nor can he make out what she says. But as she leaves the kitchen, John waves at her, his throat tight. \u201c Bye, Ethel, \u201d he says, and then sits down to finish his dinner. \n \n -- - \n \n Weeks pass, then months. The house in 1963 remains empty, and John prepares for the new school year. The first week of classes brings sweltering heat and a broken A\/C system; John envies the thunderstorms wailing through 1963, puddles dappling the lawn like spots on a Dalmatian. \n \n He doesn \u2019 t meet the new homeowners until well into September. John is lugging the lawn mower out of the shed when he turns around and finds a girl staring back at him through the slow-glass. She \u2019 s younger than John, maybe eighteen, dark hair looped behind her ears and loose around her shoulders. John abandons the mower and climbs the steps to the patio, approaching the glass until he and the girl are face to face. \n \n He recognizes the wonderment in her eyes, smiles at it. Is that how he looked, the first time he saw the slow-glass? Something makes her laugh, and she spins around, gesturing at a woman by the sink\u2014her mother, judging by the resemblance. The older woman comes to the door, standing behind the girl and placing her hands on her shoulders. John watches them speak silently to one another, wishing he were better at reading lips. In time, the mother leaves, unpinning her hair as she heads toward the living room. But the girl stays, sliding into a chair by the kitchen table and gazing raptly at the glass door. \n \n \u201c Have you given her a name yet? \u201d Margot asks the next weekend over the phone. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t need to.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Tell me a story about goddamn DRAGONS .\n","story":"Thulgaria was your typical 40-something-century old divorcee dragon. Her ex-husband, Hybolgion of the Death Skies, had left her a few ages ago for a younger dragoness with a larger, perkier flame sack and more horns. They had hoped to spice up their marriage by adding a third participant in the breeding cavern. In retrospect Thulgaria thought it had not been one of her better ideas. \n \n She now filled her time with antiquing. It exactly replicated all the excitement of her former marriage. She was presently slithering amongst the shelves of Honest Sleazy McGee's Trade Emporium. Everything here was certainly acquired by honest means in that they honestly meant to run a knife across your throat in the process of acquiring your possessions. They even took the time to wash most of the blood off, it's the little things that show a shop keeper cares. She turned the corner and sitting there was The Holy Grail. \n \n `` Hmm.'' Thulgaria hummed while scratching her jagged chin with the stub of her tail. She had been shocked 20 centuries earlier when she lost a piece of it in a battle to the death with Talos the Tail-Taker, but in all fairness how could she have seen that coming? She picked up the Grail and turned it over. Inscribed on the bottom in very holy letters was \u201c Property of J. H. Christ. If found displaced in space and time please return to 33 A.D. Jerusalem, Earth, The Universe ( The fucked up, hilariously cruel one with only 3 dimensions ) \u201d \n \n No way was Thulgaria returning this! This is exactly what she had been looking for to really pull the treasure horde together as a center piece. This could be exactly what she needed to breath a little fire back into her pedestrian life. With the Holy of Holies in her malevolent clutch she stalked towards the cash register. \n \n Thulgaria inquired the price. \n \n Sleazy eyed her sleazily and grimaced a grimace that were you to view it, you would run madly from the internet dear reader; your mind turned to something akin to the inconsistent mush which they would have to feed you at whatever insane asylum the mental health officials inevitably confined you to. Thulgaria, having suffered the ravages of marriage, was un-phased. \n \n \u201c Be ye warned, for to take possession of yonder cup ye invite a menagerie of knight errants to thy home!'twould surely be thy undoing, a dragoness of your age! Nay madam, I can not sell to ye with what I ken. \u201d \n \n `` I'll give you five dragon bucks for it'' \n \n \u201c Okay. \u201d agreed Sleazy, who was always happy to make any sale and was generally of very low ethical standards where money was concerned. His parents could have won world championships at giving babies fitting names. \n \n Thulgaria flew back to her lair with the impetulant excitement of a young hatchling that had just incinerated her first family of peasants. She placed the Grail at the center of the horde chamber. She quickly spent a few minutes rolling in a few piles of gem stones as to hide the tired and faded look of her scales that the inevitable progression of aging had wrought. She perched atop the highest pillar, now all there as to do was wait. \n \n It was about 4 in the afternoon when Thulgaria watched the beautiful stranger walk into her lair. He strode forth boldly through the mouth of the cave attired in the raiment of a Crusader. It was evident muscle issued forth from every fiber of his existence; physically, mentally and morally. He knelt in front of The Grail, made the sign of the cross and prayed. A silver beam of light that was like a unicorn vomiting gentle dreams of children issued forth from nowhere down onto his face and lit up his gently cascading long, blonde hair. He smiled and it was like receiving a blowjob from the face of God. Somewhere, on some dark, stygian jungle island lived a leper long forsaken by his tribe. The leper awoke that morning to find himself cured of his affliction. He ran out of his hut praising the Lord and was mauled by a tiger. Hey, God works in fucked up ways yo. \n \n From everywhere and nowhere a cacophony of indescribable, Cthulian sounds coalesced into something so beautiful it could only be described as the sound of angels making love to a broken accordion. A magic jazz-flute voice began to sing in a language that was ancient even at the time the earth was young. It was alien, yet discernable. \n \n The singing faded, leaving a gentle ringing in Thulgaria's ears. She contemplated what she just heard, and if she really heard it. The cavern smelt softly of fresh baked bread and wine. Bread so fresh you would have to travel backwards in time to get any fresher. \n \n The man stood and flexed. His breastplate strained to contain the holy righteousness of his 33 \u201d pythons. \n \n `` I\u2026\u2026 am Sir Religio.'' proclaimed Sir Religio. \n \n TO BE CONTINUED..... MAYBE?\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A nuclear war has swept the Earth , and you 've stumbled upon a used shelter . Inside , there 's a journal and remains .\n","story":"There \u2019 s more dust than anything else in the bunker. Doing a quick check, Jen makes sure that the door \u2019 s pulled completely closed and begins to scan the entryway. The flashlight shakes in her hand, held tightly in one hand through the plastic outfit, pistol in the other. She draws far enough away from the entrance to peer into the dim surroundings through her mask. There \u2019 s a light switch just within the frame of light. \n \n Flicking it on, there \u2019 s a quiet, barely noticeable hum from below before dim lights turn on. One flickers wildly, warning her that it was on the verge of giving out. Jen checks her Geiger counter again as she continues to move. The shelter seemed safe, it was well within the limits, even with her coming in. The other meter states that the air should be all right to breathe. \n \n Jen pulls her mask upward, pausing in anticipation as she flicks her flashlight back and forth over the small area. Seeing much better, she can barely make out the shape of another door in the dim light and searches for a way further in. If she could barely see it, they most definitely wouldn \u2019 t. She finds a dusty, unused switch to one side of the door, not even lit up, and presses the button. \n \n The door eases open with a low hiss and Jen immediately slips inside, hearing rattling and banging on the outside door. The door closes behind her almost immediately and she hears it lock tightly into place. The room is pristine and white on this side. At least it appears that way in the light of her flashlight. She searches quickly for another switch and finds it just beside the door. \n \n That \u2019 s about when the smell hits her. It \u2019 s a smell of decay and rot and she slips her mask back on while her stomach heaves. The mask narrows her vision back down again but she can breathe easier, the smell lessened. Jen knew that smell far, far too well and it terrified her to smell it on the inside of somewhere. She looks around suspiciously for anything disturbed or out of place. \n \n Everything is white and pristine. There is food storage set up along one wall. Jen can hear the gentle, quiet hum of a working refrigerator or freezer. Stacks of cans line up along shelves like little soldiers ready to do battle. The sight of bottled water makes her lick her dry, chapped lips. And still the smell persists. \n \n She takes a few careful steps forward, flicking her flashlight off to conserve its battery but keeps her pistol out in front of her. There \u2019 s a set of beds. One large, one small. Jen hadn \u2019 t seen full, fluffy blankets like those in years, even if they were dusty. She continues forward. \n \n Another \u2018 room \u2019 sectioned off by curtains holds more things that she hasn \u2019 t seen in years, televisions, gaming systems, the works, everything a kid and family might need to entertain themselves. Another room gives her a cooktop, the fridge and freezer set up beside it, their quiet hum only slightly louder now, still barely noticeable. \n \n In the last area, there are journals scattered across the desks and floor. It looks akin to a study or an office. Long dried blood creates a trail to follow to the corner of the room where what looks like human remains are. Jen counts three human skulls. Two large, one small. There \u2019 s a gun nearby, lying in the caked on blood, rusted and damaged, but she can \u2019 t force herself closer to see if there are still bullets just yet. \n Instead, Jen turns her attention to the journal on the desk, clumsily pushing it open with her gloved hands. Dust rises up into the air, but the majority sticks to the surface like mold. Her eyes skim over the yellowed pages until she finds the last entry, pausing to read it. The handwriting is elegant, even if it appears messy. \n \n She gives a small chuckle at the conclusion but trembles as if she \u2019 s going to collapse and turns her attention back to the remains. Moving closer, she can make out the shapes of what used to be three separate people, the child pressed between two parents. This many years after their deaths, they \u2019 ve become a nasty, rotting, congealed mess of blood and bone, rotting away in the dark corner of what had been a shelter but was now a tomb. \n \n \u201c Apocalypse ain \u2019 t for everyone\u2026 \u201d She murmurs quietly, eyes moving down to the gun, not wanting to look at the hollow faces any more. If they didn \u2019 t find her, this could be a good place to stay for a while. If she cleaned the bodies out.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` The elevator had an extra button , but instead of a number , it was only labeled with a question mark . ''\n","story":"It was n't until about the 5th floor I noticed something strange about the elevator I was in. There was a tiny man in the corner huddled in the foetal position. I wondered how id failed to initially notice his presence. This is a pretty rough city so I mind my own business. \n \n After an amount of time that any same sober individual would know they had been traveling upwards at a continuous rate that far exceeded the height of any building, I began to grow concerned. I reached for the elevator keypad and punched in 5. The cafeteria was on 5. That was where I had been going until this peculiar run of events, which was now making me question my sanity. The button responded to my press with a bland sound of denial. I tried six, and seven, which proceeded to produce slightly different pitches of denial. \n \n It was then that I saw the button with the question mark. Do I press it? Do I turn my attention to the tiny man in the corner? Maybe he could weigh in. I'd become ignorant of his presence. Fuck, maybe this guy is dead. I prod him with the tip of my shoe and he grunts into life with a cough and a fart. He squints up at me. `` You woke me up.'' \n \n I assess the button with the question mark again. The tiny man has returned to his eternal slumber. Turns out that was a false lead. It's been around half an hour now and I figure we must be nearing the outer atmosphere which is troubling. \n \n To the contrary, upon flipping a panel in the elevator ceiling I discovered we are, in fact, zooming through what appears to be some type of wormhole. Not sure I should've looked to be honest. I finally give in and press the button, eyes closed as I pull the trigger.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Mysterious floating orbs come to Earth and one captures you . Inside the orb you are able to see into any possible future timeline of Earth .\n","story":"Out of nowhere, it appeared. The Orb. It pulsed slowly with a soft, green light. For some reason I can not fathom, I was drawn to it immediately. There was no sound emanating from it-just the light. As I walked down from the porch, all I could hear was the crunch of leaves beneath my feet. I was entranced; the gentle pulse of the light somehow beckoned me. I reached my hand out to touch it. As I did, the light began to pulse faster, as if it could somehow sense my approach. \n \n As my hand pressed against the Orb, I suddenly found myself in a room. It was a spherical shaped room, filled with the same green light I had seen moments before. The room itself was completely barren, save for one item: a chair. I quickly looked around, seeking a hidden door, or some other means of exit. I was n't sure what this was, but it was starting to unnerve me. My hands traced the contours of the wall, my attempts to find an escape unsuccessful. With nothing else to do, I sat in the chair, with the intent of collecting my thoughts. \n \n The chair itself was unremarkable. It was n't uncomfortable, but neither was it particularly inviting. However, the second I sat down, everything changed. It's difficult to explain exactly what happened, or what I even began to see. Something resembling holographic images began to line the walls of the room. As this was happening, I felt the strangest sensation. It was as if my mind was being drawn back; that I was simultaneously both sitting in the chair and outside an imaginary window looking in at it. \n \n I immediately wanted to stand up from the chair. Whatever this was, I was n't going to mess with it. As I did so, however, the images changed. Even though I had gotten up from the chair, I still retained the feeling of being drawn back, observing. In one image, I was standing up from the chair. In a second image, I was still sitting in it. I resolved to look at the chair in greater detail; more images appeared. One showed me carefully examining the chair, the other saw me doing my best to break it. \n \n As I imagined various scenarios, I began to grasp what exactly I was seeing. I was seeing possible futures. I began to look at the images in greater detail, looking for clues that might allow me to escape from whatever this was. Eventually, through trial and error, I was able to find a scenario in which I was able to access a user interface. I performed the necessary actions, and was rewarded with the interface that I had seen in the image. My initial thoughts were correct. It is a machine designed to show alternate futures. Every decision, every course of action capable of being analyzed and consequences shown. It turns out though, that I was vastly underestimating what the machine was capable of. \n \n I was able to draw even further back, and chart the courses of history. Endless possibilities! I was able to fast forward and rewind time; but only to or from the point I had entered the orb. I saw governments rise and fall. I saw families torn apart and reunited. I saw everything. Including the other orbs. One by one, I followed the timeline variations of the other orbs. Each ended only in tragedy. \n \n Preparing myself for the worst, I began to look at my orb's possibilities. Many of them ended as the others had. But to my surprise, there was one which did not. I studied the image, desperate to learn how to bring about this particular scenario. As I took note of the the particular details, I saw myself in the image studying what appeared to be a peaceful society. Using the controls, I filtered through the images, searching for this particular outcome without success. \n \n I was about to give up when another image caught my eye. It was an image in which I rose out of the chair, turned to myself, and mouthed something at, well, me. It took me a few tries, but I was finally able to make out what he-what I was saying. Once I did, I found the image I needed-the one that would see me safely out of the orb. I tried to follow it past that, but the image became garbled and static. I did n't spend too long on it though, I was ready to leave. I knew the future that I wanted to see-the one of peace. While I did n't know exactly how to get there, I did know the first step. I rose out of my chair, turned around, and mouthed the words \u201c Be the change you want to see in the World \u201d. \n \n -End- \n \n Thanks for a fun prompt! Feedback and CC welcome!\n"}

{"prompt":"[ IP ] Cyberpunk room\n","story":"Propaganda posters covered the wall above a single bed in one corner of the room, illuminated by the warm morning light shining through a large trapezoid window. On the bed lay a crumpled black t shirt and a rifle, its holographic sight still turned on. A pair of gray and khaki polymer combat boots stood on the metal tiled floor at the foot of the bed. \n \n The wall opposite the posters was dominated by a large touchscreen above a white plastic desk, plugged into a white plastic cube. The three columns of data the monitor displayed changed as a woman hammered commands into the prompt below them. She wore nothing but black cargo pants and kneepads, their surfaces scratched from use. Her irises glowed faintly, spinning rapidly as she refocused on different data. Long brown hair fell past her shoulders. \n \n A head sized UAV lay unmoving on the table, its chassis cut open. Several cables connected it to the white cube. Various sensors and transmitters had been removed from it and were collected in a pile at the end of the table. Beside them was a laptop displaying a CLI with an angular black wristband connected to it. \n \n The woman continued scanning through the drone's memory, searching for what she needed. She stopped and clicked her tongue as a string of letters and numbers appeared in the third column. \n \n She leaned across the table to pull the laptop and wristband closer. The laptop printed a page of text as she entered a command, decrypting the data she was looking for. She copied the files to the wristband and detached it from the laptop, fastening it around her left wrist. It projected a 3D map of the interior of a building, with several points marked by glowing cubes. Lines appeared and vanished, leading in different paths around the building. \n \n The woman stopped the projection and swiveled off her chair. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n It's really hard to write something with one character, one room, no backstory, and an activity that does n't lend itself to descriptions. Pulling a plaintext encryption key out of a UAV's memory is of course ridiculous, but it was that or a 3000 word cryptanalysis infodump. I'll avoid using that kind of thing as a major plot element in the future unless I can accurately describe the process without boring the reader. \n \n I like the first paragraph, but after that it gets worse. From the first you can get that someone has recently gotten back from doing something with a rifle, and that person has propaganda posters all over one wall. It established the character fairly well without explicitly saying anything about her. \n \n Throughout the whole thing the writing feels repetitive and sometimes disjointed. \n \n All 319 words took 7 hours to write between 2 days which is absolutely ridiculous. \n \n Maybe I'll write something about what that map is and why she wanted it.\n"}

The room is, as it was, piled almost to the ceiling with various detritus and waste. A nonsense of biological waste, syringes, needles and bloodied rags are a familiar welcoming party by this stage. No point in cleaning up. I suppose he thought the same. \n \n My music has slowed to a steady drone with faint harmonics rises and falling above. I feel relaxed, comfortable initially. It \u2019 s like a strange kind of home, this place. Or a tomb is perhaps more apt. Though nobody would keep their loved one \u2019 s tomb in such a disgusting state so perhaps I do think of it as his home. I recognise elements in the music I \u2019 m listening to, my very own particular biometric soundtrack. It \u2019 s a strange sensation. As I think of this tomb, him buried so far beneath the earth, I can feel myself getting upset. I can hear it too. A certain atonality and bassy resonance. The software is emphasizing the underlying major chords, levelling the dynamics and removing all syncopation. It \u2019 s trying to calm me down. I focus, trying to push the shuddering, rising feedback out of my aural sphere. The exercise, the meditation of trying to alter the music, rather than alter the emotions, feels like playing an instrument, the input is so disparate from the output it \u2019 s hard to believe the two actions are linked. But it only really works in situations where I \u2019 m not interacting with anyone. It \u2019 s pretty damn hard to play an instrument and hold a conversation at the same time. So I remove the earpieces. This will naturalise my mood but I \u2019 m not in a position to use them anymore. \n \n I head down the hallway into the central chamber. From the main chamber came a steady blue glow, lighting up the lining of refuse close to the end of the hallway. \n \n The air gradually becomes sickly sweet as I approach the nest. The hum of electronics becomes louder and more pressing. \n \n I turn the corner and see that disgusting alter once more. A viscous anger rises from my stomach. \n \n How could you let me see you like this? \n \n Like a metallic birds nest lies the Alter. Long ago, he laid his body down on this simple table in the centre of the room. Every square inch of his skin blossoms with meters of wire, tubing and sensory cables. The array of threads and spines rises up from his decaying frame like a forest, accumulating on the high ceiling before drooping back down into various esotery in the chamber. Such is the quantity of cabling and wires that enter\/leave his body his shape is splayed over the table, like something pried open for observation. It is as if he had been carrying a horrible pregnancy of steel, copper and fibre and had lain down in the chamber to painfully birth the alien material out of every pore and orifice. \n \n The first time I saw this I couldn \u2019 t even entertain the thought that this was him. I ran outside and vomited. It \u2019 s a horrific sight, still. \n \n Next to him is a woman. She is seated in the same chair as she is every year. The woman is sat up straight, as if to attention.

Ardin was a senator from South Aminson, Sector VII, Atlantis, which up to now was a territory of the United States, and had been since the 1963 treaty. Jedd turned on the holovision, hoping he was n't too late. He had made it back to Atlantia, the capital of Sector VII, the American Sector, just before the Federal Defense Command closed the borders between Atlantis and the U.S. The talking heads were discussing the division of Atlantis while waiting for Alexsandr Standetov to take the podium. Jedd took advantage of this to change and start some dinner while he had time.

Jedd decided he better leave Washington before the FDC prevented him from getting home. \n \n At last the holoscreen changed and the face of Standetov appeared, so Jedd turned up the volume to hear what the Governor General of Sector IV, better known as the Atlantis Oblast of Russia, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, more commonly just called \u201c The Oblast \u201d had to say. Standetov began his speech in Russian, and the translation in English quickly followed, expertly translated by the local station's AI. \n \n \u201c One hundred fourteen years ago, on October 28, 1962, our world was on the brink of World War III. My homeland, the Soviet Union, had supplied Cuba, a small island nation that once was south of Florida, with nuclear missiles in response to the United States setting up missiles in Europe. The President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, threatened a blockade to prevent any more missiles from entered Cuba. We had decided to back down and remove the missiles to prevent war, but certain military leaders within Cuba seized the missiles and declared a new government. Fidel Castro, the leader of Cuba attempted to retake the missiles, but when it was clear that the coup would be defeated, the missiles were detonated. \n \n \u201c The resulting explosion destroyed Cuba and most of the other Caribbean islands when a then unknown fault line was triggered. The resulting sea quakes resulted in the rebirth of the lost continent of Atlantis, just where Plato said it would be. \n \n \u201c The appearance of the new continent caused much damage to the eastern coast of the United States, the nation of Portugal, and British Isles, and western Africa \u2013 damage that would take decades to repair. \n \n \u201c As a result of the Cuban catastrophe, the nations of the world through the United Nations decided to divide the new continent into 16 sectors, each to be assigned to one of the major nations on the planet. It was hoped that Plato's continent would contain the remains of an advanced civilization that had lead the world before Altantis sank. We hoped that the great civilizations that followed \u2013 the Aztecs, Mayans, Greeks, Babylonians, and Egyptians would be poor relations to the great Atlantian culture. \n \n \u201c What was found was disappointing. Yes, we found ruins and evidence of civilization in Atlantis, the most famous being the Lost City, in Lisbee ( Canadian Sector VI ), but no advanced technology or signs of Alien influence. Atlantis had advanced culture, but at most the technological level of the Roman Empire. \n \n \u201c By the 1990s, the empty lands of Atlantis had began to be settled by citizens of the countries that were in charge of the 16 sectors. Each sector belonged to the country that was assigned to it. Today that changes. The Atlantian accord was signed earlier today in Atlantia by the Governors of Lisbee ( VI ), VII, and myself. The other 12 sectors will be signing in the next few days. Today we declare ourselves no longer to be 16 separate colonies, but one United Continent of Atlantis! \n \n The Capital of The United Continent of Atlantis will be Atlantia, which is the largest city near the center of the continent. I plan to travel to Atlantia in the next few days to declare my candidacy for the position of Grand Commander. The United Atlantian Army, the MTK, has been authorized to use force against any armies that attempt to retake our territory. That includes the Soviet Union. The *USS Kennedy*, the *Chairman Mao*, the *Prince of Wales* and the Soviet destroyer *Putin* will be allowed to leave United Atlantian territory unharmed in the next 24 hours. A temporary Government will be set up in Atlantia until elections are final. As I speak, the national flags in each of the 16 sectoral capitals are being lowered and the tri-mountain and globe of the United Continent is being raised. After over 100 years of being controlled from abroad, Atlantis is taking control of her own destiny. Good evening. \u201d \n \n Jedd turned off the holoscreen and sat down to eat his dinner. He was no longer a Senator in Washington, it seemed. He could either attempt to re-enter the United States and figure out what to do once he was stripped of his seat, or he could stay here in Atlantia, and join the new government. The decision was easy. Jedd looked out the window over to where the first sublight ship to go to the stars, the *Ptera*, was being built. VII, Sector VII, was the past, and The United Continent Of Atlantis was the future.

Keeping you from this is the fulfillment of your last contract : A celebrated performer paid you to kill him if he ever tried to make a `` comeback '' as an old man . After years in retirement , the performer announces a world tour .\n","story":"**In this line of work, there were few answers, and many** ***questions. *** \n \n One question, in particular, stuck out like a knife from a dead man's chest: `` Could you ever kill a friend?'' \n \n For years, Blay the Assassin thought about it, turning it over and over in the quiet hours of the long, cold nights. The unanswered question never diminished. Blay's passion for the craft, however, did. He found himself a rich man, and even the luster of `` professional power-shifting'' had grown tiresome to him. \n \n Blay the Assassin was done. \n \n Or so he thought. \n \n One day, the unanswered question burned a bright, new mark on his curiosity. \n \n An old friend had returned. \n \n Decades ago, Blay performed a service for a rising star in the entertainment industry - a singer, a non-commercial wonder who rebelled against the established industry. \n \n This singer, known as Zalla, was so loved *because* he fought against the syndicated corporations where all music `` thrived.'' He claimed, `` Music is the deepest expression of the soul. And the soul can never be bought. So why should Music?'' \n \n Zalla wrote all of his own songs, and never once sold a single ticket, despite playing to crowds of millions. \n \n There were men who wanted Zalla dead. \n \n But Zalla was full of life, and anger, and strength. And so, he called upon Blay. Blay performed his duties with the utmost professionalism: no questions asked, and no answers left behind. The deaths of a few corporate overlords went unsolved. \n \n But the message was made clear, and Zalla continued to grow, and gather the world under his profitless blanket. \n \n Near the end of his journey, Zalla called upon Blay once more. He invited the assassin into his private home - a small cabin on a mountain road - and together they drank whiskey and tea. \n \n It was Zalla who began the conversation, `` Sir, you and I are nothing alike. But that does not mean we are not friends.'' \n \n Blay, who could practically smell a job coming, merely nodded. \n \n Zalla took a swig of whiskey, and held it in his mouth, letting the pain of bitterness seep into his features. He swallowed hard, `` I must ask you something then, Blay.'' \n \n `` Of course.'' Blay would not vocalize his presumptions, but he knew what was coming. Most people had to work themselves up to the question of murder. \n \n `` Blay, have you ever killed a friend?'' \n \n It was not the question he had expected. Zalla still had so many enemies, what need did he for killing friends? \n \n Blay pursed his lips, and shook his head, `` No. At least, not one of my own.'' \n \n `` But if the need *did* arise, could you do it?'' \n \n `` Anything can be bought,'' Blay said, echoing a half-line from one of Zalla's songs: *Anything can be bought, but not everything should be sold... * \n \n A wide, brimming smile spread Zalla's lips, `` Good, good. That's what I needed to hear.'' \n \n And that's when Zalla asked the one question Blay could never figure out: `` Blay, my old friend, I am done with this life. But that does not mean this life is done with me. One day, they will try to bring me back - they know there is money in every thing I do, every word I sing. Blay, should I ever try to bring back the old, and call it new, and should I ever sell it to the world, could you kill me?'' \n \n `` I could kill you right now, if you wanted.'' \n \n Zalla chuckled, and slapped his knee, `` No, ho-ho, no. Later will be just fine, Blay. I have n't sold my soul just yet.'' \n \n And so the years parted like fields of grain, blurring together until Blay could not remember one from the next. But he always remembered Zalla's question. \n \n Just when he believed the question would go forever unanswered, an announcement shook the world. \n \n Zalla had returned. His music was the same, but the message of free expression was overshadowed by a visible layer of filth and corporate greed. The expenses for marketing alone would've been enough to feed a small country for a century. \n \n It was a surprise to Blay. He thought the old musician had died a long time ago. He had heard less and less from his old friend, and watched him slowly decay under the weight of time. This news of Zalla's return brought a comforting, mixed joy to Blay. \n \n Blay, an old man with streaks of black still lingering in his gray mane, remembered his promise to his old friend. He did not know if he could go through with it. \n \n But he *was* a professional. No matter how hard the job was, he would try to keep his promise. \n \n It was on the night of the first concert that Blay made his appearance. The swarms of people filled the city until it began to burst, and no amount of enforcement could keep their excited energy at bay. \n \n Zalla had returned. \n \n Blay found him in a dressing room, buried deep below the largest stage ever built. A wake of unconscious bodyguards lay bleeding or groaning in the hallways behind. \n \n And there was Zalla - a fraction older, a fraction fatter, but it was Zalla, nonetheless. \n \n `` Hello, old friend,'' Blay said, a gun hidden behind his back, `` It's so good to see you again, despite our circumstances.'' \n \n All things considered, to see the old musician once again made his chest swell with warmth. \n \n `` Who the hell are you?'' Zalla said, leaning into his mirror, absorbed by his own reflection. \n \n It was a pain Blay felt in his heart, more than anywhere else. Nobody likes to be forgotten. \n \n `` You asked me a question, so many years ago. And I am here to answer it, just as promised.'' \n \n Perhaps it was the tone of Blay's voice that pulled Zalla away from the mirror. Blay's watched as his old friend slowly turned towards him. And for a moment, Blay believed - *he truly believed* - that he would not be able to uphold his bargain. \n \n He could not kill his old friend. \n \n But it was *not* the Zalla that Blay once knew. The lips were the same, but the smile was wrong. And the eyes - they were not the deep, blue pools of wisdom that Blay had once known. They belonged to someone else. \n \n This, then, was the answer: Zalla had not come back from the dead. \n \n Instead, the new corporate masters had killed the old Zalla, and replaced him with a fake. It was everything the real Zalla had feared. \n \n The warmth was sucked from Blay's chest. He pulled out the gun, and aimed it at the Fake. \n \n `` What is this?'' the Fake stuttered, falling back against his mirror, `` What are you doing with that?'' \n \n It was the easiest question Blay had ever answered.\n"}

Sure, sometimes I did n't hold the door when I was in a hurry and I've cut people off in traffic without using my blinker because I was careless or left the milk out on the counter. I never thought that those minor infractions would lead me to where I am today. \n \n I collapsed on the floor of my house and when I woke up I was in a place that looked like a cave. It seemed a little odd and it was a bit hot but not unbearable. The kind of hot where it does n't warrant turning on the AC but opening the window is n't quite enough, just rather inconvenient. I began my journey through the cave and came upon an elevator. There was a man inside and as soon as I came up to it the door began to close. I yelled for him to hold it and he just stared at me and allowed the door to close. No matter, I casually thought, I'll just get the next one. I got the next elevator and there was another man inside. As soon as the door closed, he passed a large amount of gas and giggled. It was disgusting and nothing I did could help me escape the smell. \n \n I got off the elevator after what seemed like the longest ride in history into a convenience store. I had no idea where I was so I decided to go to the counter to ask for information. There was a small line so I stepped behind an elderly woman to wait my turn. It turns out every person in line was getting lottery tickets, a lot of them, and they were completely undecided about which tickets they wanted and I was beginning to get a little annoyed as this short wait was turning into a rather long one. Another worker, who noticed this stepped up to open another register, at which point the 2 people in line behind me jumped up and ran over, essentially skipping me in line, and they also wanted a large amount of lottery tickets. Damn, I thought, all of this is turning out to be inconvenient and annoying. The elevator, the people in line... I just want to know where I am and what to do. \n \n I finally get to the register and the woman looks at her watch and exclaims `` Oh it's my break time!'' and walks away, leaving me to get back in the other line, which has swelled a good bit with more people buying lottery tickets. At this point, I just decide to leave and figure things out on my own. \n \n I leave the store and walk to the street and notice I do n't recognize any landmarks. I walk down the street, attempting to hail a cab to have them take me somewhere recognizable and as I'm doing so, I turn around and someone runs into me, effectively spilling their coffee down my new white shirt my wife had just gotten for me that day and they begin yelling at me for spilling their overpriced Starbucks. This day was shaping up to be one of the worst I've had in a long time. I turn around to just walk away and I step into the street to cross it, just in time to see a semi-truck bearing down on me. \n \n I wake up in a cave that's just a little too hot, and there seems to be an elevator off in the distance...\n"}

He'd been looking at everything around him with disbelief for the past 4 hours, ever since the car had reached that city. That modern, wealthy, non-post-apocaliptic city. Mike had only known one other city in his life, and it was made of a bunch of tent and shaggy wood sheds; the best food that could be bought there was overcooked raccoon meat, and you would n't survive more than 7 minutes if there was n't at least one person in your group carrying a shotgun. The city where he was, in the other hand, had tall, beautiful buildings, with plants growing on the walls and solar panels on the roof. People were riding bikes, and purchasing food which he did n't even recognize but which looked delicious nonetheless. \n \n `` So. How did you manage it? How did you keep that El-Dorado alive in our fucked-up world?'' \n \n Mike was really only interested in the answer to the next question he was going to ask, which was whether he would be allowed to live there. A question which he was in fact never going to ask. \n \n `` This is n't an El Dorado. It's not unique. \n \n -You mean that there are other cities like this? \n \n -I mean that most of the world is like this.'' \n \n There was a short silence. \n \n `` Wait, what? \n \n -I said, the whole world is like this. \n \n -What do you mean? \n \n -Most of the planet is modern and wealthy. The devastated world you have been living in only occupies a relatively small area, which corresponds to approximately one fifth of what used to be the United States of America. \n \n -I... I do n't understand. \n \n -When the First Civilisation collapsed, a small entity, known as *the phoenix seed*, survived. It had been created by the United Nations in preparation for the apocalypse, and it's mission was to keep all human knowledge safe, then use it wisely to rebuild humanity. Their mission worked better than anyone had hoped. Not only did they survive, but they kept their 22nd century tech, and within a few decades they were by far the most advanced military faction in the world. At first, they stayed in their shelter-city in central Eurasia, then they started spreading their knowledge and building a new civilisation around them. Almost everyone was eager to join them, and they were able to organise the new society in a smart liquid democracy, with an advanced local social-focused economy, strong ethical values, and an ecological mindset. The new world they were building quickly became better than any utopia our ancestors had ever dreamed of. Culture and philosophy flourished, and everyone contributed to building this new world. Within less than a century, most of the planet was re-settled. \n \n -Bullshit! This is... this... Fucking Bullshit! I've heard enough of that. My whole life, I've never seen even a trace of that `` Utopia'' you talk about. \n \n -I know, that's on purpose. \n \n -Wha... hu.. I do n't... \n \n -Let me finish please. Our new culture valued, among other things, knowledge and diversity. We did our best to recover all we could from the fragments of the dead cultures and traditions which had been shattered by the apocalypse. But as we were spreading, we realized that we were about to kill a culture ourselves: the apocalypse culture. Without us, the world had organised itself in a violent, brutal, self-destructive, but also complex and fascinating way. The people living in the post-apocalypse world had a mindset, a way of thinking, a way of acting, which was unique and which no one in our world could ever possess. And we were about to loose that.'' \n \n Mike began to see where this was going. And he did n't like it. \n \n `` So we created the apocalypse reservation. We designated an area in which we would never spread our new civilisation, we made sure it did n't know about what was happening outside, and we made it's borders difficult to cross so the people in it would stay, and thus your world was preserved. \n \n -How... how long? \n \n -The reservation was created 93 years after the apocalypse. \n \n -... 62 years. For 112 years, we've been living in an artificial apocalypse. For the past century, we could have been living in your heaven, and instead you left us in our hell. \n \n -Yes. \n \n -Why? Whyy? \n \n -Heaven would n't be complete if it did n't have a bit of hell in it.'' \n \n Mike burst out crying. He kept crying for what seemed to him like a very long time, and the others waited. Then finally he stopped, and looked back at them. \n \n `` You said you had strong moral values. Is this the work of strong moral values? \n \n -We, as a society, spent a lot of time thinking about this, and in the end we reached the conclusion that it was, ethically, the right thing to do. \n \n -Was it worth it. \n \n -Yes. Now people like you exist. \n \n -What use are people like me? \n \n -Well, if you were n't useful we would n't have brought you here. \n \n -Wait, you mean...'' \n \n Although the circumstances which had lead him to be driven to the new world had been odd, he had completely forgotten about them as soon as they had entered the city. Now that he thought back on them, everything suddenly made sense. \n \n `` First, we'll let you settle down in our city, and enjoy our food, healthcare and comfort.

Finally, 009 made his exit out into the hustle and bustle of the Wal-Mart. \n \n \n \n The noon sun was bright and 009 wore gaudy five dollar sunglasses to shield his eyes from it. 009 was driving to the place where he intended to confront the most dubious Scumbaggington. He knew just where he would be. Scumbaggington would be where all of the other hungover people of Collier County would be on a Thursday afternoon- Waffle House. \n \n 009 pulled into the cramped parking lot and worked his way into a parking space. He swung open the door of his white 1994 Honda Accord directly into the silver door of a 1997 Ford Taurus. He looked around to make sure no one saw his mistake before climbing out of the car and heading towards the entrance. \n \n Near the entrance, he paused in the haze of people smoking to prepare for his confrontation. He slid his specs in the inside pocket of his windbreaker and noted the distasteful look the smokers gave him. *I am the only person who keeps his sunglasses in there* he thought to himself. *All these scumbags keep a flask or a pack of smokes in there. * \n \n He pulled open the door and stepped into the Waffle House. He scanned the sea of hangovers until he spotted Scumbaggington \u2019 s chubby face and thinning, slicked back hair. He was sitting with two of his favorite scumbag lackeys. They locked eyes and 009 made his way over to Scumbaggington who sat near the window overlooking the parking lot. \n \n \u201c You door dinged me, guy! I just watched you! \u201d Scumbaggington began with an annoyed look on his tired face. \u201c You come to apologize? \u201d \n \n \u201c We exchanged a little paint, yeah, \u201d 009 admitted. \u201c A little paint should be least of your worries. Considering- \u201d \n \n \u201c Considering what!? \u201d \n \n 009 turned to the rest of the restaurant, \u201c Considering, \u201d he began to announce, \u201c you \u2019 re scheming to disrupt the cigarette supply for all of Collier County! \u201d The restaurant went silent. The shoveling of food into mouths seized. All eyes were on 009. \u201c If cigarettes are available at all, prices can be expected to double if your operation is successful. \u201d \n \n Men and women began sliding out of booths and backing their chairs away from tables. As they made their way to their feet, Scumbaggington began looking around helplessly before locking eyes with 009. 009 basked in the impending doom in Scumbaggington \u2019 s eyes for a moment before making his way to the exit. The people smoking outside brushed past him into the restaurant, cigarettes clenched tightly in their mouths. \n \n As he made his way to his car, he could hear the cacophony of Scumbaggington and his lackeys being beaten to mush by the inhabitants of the restaurant. He pulled his sunglasses out from his \u201c flask \u201d pocket and slid them onto his face. When he opened the door of his car, which he had not bothered to lock since the fab stopped functioning six years ago, he made sure to really give the silver 1997 Ford Taurus parked next to him a good ding. \n\n"}

But if you decide there's a shallow grave there, you got ta have good coverage, let me tell ya. Otherwise you're gon na have a mess on your hands.'' He chuckled. \n \n Watching him on television, Maria frowned at this, and wondered at such an uncharacteristic joke. His voice still made her scalp prickle in that peculiar way ( the term `` ASMR'' would not be invented for decades yet ), but the joke just did n't seem in keeping with her favorite painter. She never talked about the show at work. She did n't even paint. Was n't sure why she sat here mesmerized for hours just listening to Ross speak. Still, she wondered, did the creepy factor make the tingling ever so much stronger? She was n't sure. \n \n `` And then take your flat bladed knife, just like this, and you make a lot of tiny little vertical slashes.'' Maria was enraptured. `` All straight up and down. Straight up and down. There? See. Looks just like branches and roots. People will think you worked forever on that much detail. Detail is very important when you've got something to hide.'' He paused, furrowed his brow a bit, `` Or really anytime. Not just when you're hiding a body. Or hiding anything. Does n't have to be a body. Point is, details are always very important when creating your little world.'' \n \n But she was ignoring the actual words. Maria was simply focused on the sound of Bob's voice. As she stared at the painting, she began to think the scene seemed eerily familiar somehow. No, probably not, she thought. He was just that good at painting. He made scenes so real you *felt* like you'd seen them somewhere before. \n \n The phone ringing interrupted this train of thought with a jolt. Sighing a much put upon sigh, she turned down the volume on the TV and picked up the line. `` Krager,'' she said into the phone. \n \n `` Detective? We got another missing person case out at Carlisle Park. Chief says he wants you and Daniels on it ASAP,'' said the dispatch voice on the other end of the line. \n \n `` Aw, what *now*?'' she complained. She was going to miss the end of Bob Ross. \n \n `` Oh, I'm sorry, Detective Krager,'' said the dispatcher sarcastically, `` Shall I tell the Chief he is working you too hard and you need your TV shows? Yes, *now*!'' \n \n `` Alright, alright,'' she said, her pleasant mood rudely interrupted for the time being. `` Carlisle Park. Tell Daniels I'll meet him in ten.'' She slammed the phone down and with great regret switched the TV off. Damn the budget. Next weekend she was going to get a VCR so she would n't keep missing stuff. \n \n She threw on her jacket, double checked her badge and gun were in place, then headed for the door. Then stopped, her brow furrowing in concentration. Wait a minute. Carlisle Park. Was n't *that* where she had seen the landscape in Bob Ross's latest painting? Now that she thought about it -- - Nah. Probably just her imagination. It was a funny thing how the mind made its own little world. But you could n't let that little world run away with you.

The water batters the bottom of the can with the same ferocity as the doubt in his head. \n \n `` It does n't need to be a masterpiece, just focus on the process'', echoes from somewhere in the back of his head until the words come out as a faint whisper from his lips. \n \n `` More happy trees today? ``, his wife Sharon calls out muffled from another room. Startled, Clay turns off the faucet and glances out the window. The sheet of white and cotton covered limbs scattered throughout the rear of his cabin bring him back. \n \n With some resolution, he responds,'' uh, yea, perfect day for it, weather guy says we're getting another 7'' today.'' Hell, any day up here in the winter is a perfect day for it, he thinks. Every year he comes up to this part of Wisconsin seems to have the same forecast, only the inches of snow on screen vary. Does n't bother him though, the isolation is what he and his wife looked for shortly after retirement 11 years ago. Turning their summer vacation home to almost a permanent residence these days. \n \n Back in the den, Clay tightens the screws on his rickety easel. Beneath, lies a paint blotted bedsheet from the old guest room no one has used in over a year. Not that it matters, the kids moved out of the main house over 20 years ago, and even the grand kids are sprouting their own branches of the family tree. Last June, his third great grandchild was born he has yet to see. More often than not, it's just him an Sharon these days, no matter where they are. \n \n A 27'' Vizio sits in one corner of the den displaying a fuzzy haired man frozen in place while wielding a human sized paintbrush. He told Gary, his eldest son, he had no use for the damn thing, and that he hardly knew how to use it, but he brought it wrapped two Christmas' ago anyway. \n \n `` Look Dad, I know you've said you do n't need this crap, but I'm sure Ma could use the break from you just staring out the window'', Gary says with a Wink to his mom. Then continues, `` I do n't know how but you all still somehow get the connection to run it, even out here in BFE.'' \n \n Clay hates to admit it, and probably wo n't, but he has used it. Alot. Gary got it to pop up Netflix every time he turns it on too, telling him they just added those weird painting shows he and Ginny used to watch all the time before both went silent long enough for Sharon to interrupt about needing help with dinner. \n \n A picture of Ginny, in her Junior Prom dress complete with yards of fabric and a hair do to match most women her age, if she was still here, would swear they never had occupies the only frame in Clay's den. Family photos from the decades litter the walls throughout the rest of the house, but his Ginny is the only one allowed here. That and an old tennis shoe atop the mantle, a women's size 7, sit side-by-side. \n \n Clay taps the glass of the frame, says, `` I miss you honey, every day'', something he's made a habit of since setting them there and proceeds to the remote on the coffee table. \n \n Clicking play, the fuzzy haired man tells his audience for probably the hundredth time about the joys of painting, how he's met so many wonderful people over the years since the show began, and today he was going to replicate a picture he took on vacation, a summer scene. Clay welcomed the warmth of this kind of picture in his snowed in enclave. \n \n `` Today we'll be using Cadmium Yellow, Ultramarine Blue, Veridian Green, Burnt Umber, a smidge of Alizeran Crimson and as always, some Titanium White'', reports the fuzzy haired man. Without skipping a beat, he adds, `` do n't be afraid of any mistake, we call those happy accidents'' \n \n Clay has painted along with this guy about 40 times now and grunts with the sentiment. His `` happy accidents'' feel more like car wrecks, but it has n't deterred him yet. His wife out of pity, or pride as she claims, has two of his more recent works hung in the living room for all to see. He'd be more embarrassed to have them there if it were n't just them staring at them day in and out. \n \n They're halfway through the episode when instructed to switch over to a palette knife, in not having much of a studio, Clay grabs an expired credit card and icing spreader that do well enough whenever making a shack or fence post commonly added to these paintings. \n \n He begins to add the crimson, white and burnt umber together, following along to add a box shape they'll come back to later, but first, the idea of a little creek emerges needing them to switch back to the 1'' chip brush, `` to block in the water''. \n \n Clay curses the copy in front of him, he was n't going for anything abstract, but the blobs form something closer to a Picasso than the idyllic landscape on screen. \n \n Having blocked in the water, Clay stares back at his work and overhears the fuzzy haired man say, `` and my favorite part, take your brush, dip in the thinner and then beat the living devil out of it''. The giddy hiccup that follows unnerves Clay, always does. \n \n This is the point where the urge to create competes with the burning in his knees, and easily wins. He plops in the chair to watch the rest of the work come to life knowing his canvas is n't even worth poking with a stick to determine life. It's almost over anyway, these things seem come to life toward the very end of the episode after questioning how an ocean or woods will come to life after scrubbing in a layer of concentric circles in the first couple minutes. \n \n The man goes through the motions adding happy little tree after happy little tree to the forefront until satisfied and decides to end this episode with his little shed from earlier. He replicates the wood grain and slanted roof of his shack before making one stroke too far, then reminding his viewers that there are no mistakes, only happy accidents. Bringing back the knife, he fixes his building with a slight addition then dabs in a shrub or two to make it recede again. Quite happy with his work, he thanks his viewers for joining this episode of The Joy of Painting, until next time and trails off. \n \n Clay's eyes drift from the final product to his own, then out the window to the snow in lazy succession beginning to further build on the trees and wood shed out back. A summer scene shows on his TV, but he ca n't stop the feeling that he's looking at something familiar. As the snow melts in late spring the wooded area behind his cabin has it's own creek visible running perpendicular to the shed. \n \n He glances between all three again and again until the picture on screen gives way to credits with the window on the bottom right counting down until the next episode. The auto play is about to boot when the scrolling marquee shows: \n \n A SPECIAL THANKS: To my sweet Virginia \n \n Clay springs from the chair and clutches his chest. \n \n \n\n"}

But how? \n \n There was too much left to do. Our sins were not yet complete. How to fight the disease before anyone knew it even was a disease. Before we all gave up the right to have private thoughts and secret associations. Freedom depended on fighting this battle, on making sure history did n't unfold that way, but how?

They never talked about there plans to anyone, but the powers that were trying to be would rightly be suspicious of their abilities. The more power the more insecurity, they both knew this from reading Plato. So they set about making backup plans. And Jim was one of them. \n \n He never met them. either of them. He did n't get the news that they were dead. Knew nothing of the conspiracy theories, or the drama, or any of it. Jim lived alone. Unplugged.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A kid doodling in a math class accidentally creates the world 's first functional magic circle in centuries .\n","story":"I was *distinctly* sure I was using a blue pen. How did the color change? \n \n As always, I was just absent-mindedly doodling different sized circles and patterns. I've always enjoyed symmetry and geometric shapes and spirals, so my hand just did that naturally, I suppose; my notebook was absolutely full of them. More drawings than words. Today was no different. I was n't really even paying attention to what I was drawing: Samantha was wearing that tight red shirt that shows off a bit of cleavage, and I was sitting just at the right angle across from her. The tip of the pen floated over the paper like I was using a ouija board as I tried to get just a peek of her bra. \n \n I managed to tear my eyes away to glance down at the paper. The ink had turned black. I would n't have even noticed, but I *always* use a blue pen. Had I grabbed the wrong one? \n \n I scribbled in the margins, drawing jagged blue lines. Definitely not the pen. \n \n I took a closer look. The paper around my doodle was yellowed and warped like a toasted marshmallow. I poked at a particularly large bubble that had arisen, and shrank back like I'd been bitten: the paper was *really warm*. \n \n I looked at my neighbor's paper. Nothing there; just plain white words covered in his chicken scratch notes. *Hmmm*. \n \n I took a good look at the drawing. I'd never really done one like this. Sure it had the same undulating waves and curves that most of mine did, but there was just something odd about the way that this one all fit together, like I'd traced it out of a book. Studying it closely, I moved to touch the drawing itself. My arm hesitated, like it recognized some danger that my mind just did n't see. And it was right. \n \n As soon as my finger touched the now-black ink outlining the pattern, I felt a jolt of lightning shoot through my finger and up my arm, tingling like I was covered in skittering spider legs. I leapt out of my desk, scattering my textbooks on the floor and sliding the notebook across the room. \n \n `` Mr. Hamilton!'' my teacher shouted, more in surprise than anger. I ignored her, never taking my eyes off the notebook. My arm was still tingling. `` Sit down! What is the matter with you?'' \n \n Another student, Paul, reached for my notebook. `` DO N'T TOUCH THAT!'' I yelled before even realizing what I was doing. He shrank away like a beaten puppy. The rest of the class stared at me with a mix of giggles, confusion, and derision. \n \n `` Mr. Hamilton, sit back down in your desk right now,'' the teacher called out. \n \n I managed to snap out of it. Probably just static electricity. \n \n `` Sorry, Ms. Mason,'' I said. I gingerly reached for the notebook, expecting another shock. But nothing happened. I gathered up the rest of my belongings and returned to my seat while she went back to teaching whatever topic I was supposed to be learning. \n \n Across the room, Samantha smiled at me, not mockingly like the others. I felt my cheeks turn red, and I went back to my drawing, trying to act casual. The ink was back to blue, and the paper was flat and plain white. *Maybe I just imagined it, * I rationalized. I continued doodling and tried to guess what color her bra might be. \n \n Across the room, Samantha's red shirt was suddenly shredded to ribbons and fell to the floor like confetti. I was n't too concerned with *how* it had happened; never look a gift horse in the mouth and all that. Finally I had my answer: white with red polka dots. And I was so distracted that I barely even felt the tingling sensation return to my arm.\n"}

The jury rigged suit patch on my arm wouldn \u2019 t hold forever, and when it went, I was in for a nasty case of decompression. That or asphyxia. \n \n I think it probably said a lot about my life choices so far that my only options were very slow unpleasant death, slow unpleasant death, or fast unpleasant death. I resolved to tear the suit patch out in nineteen minutes. \n \n Hey, no-one wants to die, even when it \u2019 s the only option left. \n \n I brought my arm up, and tapped the control I we had been instructed to avoid using. The radio came online. \n \n \u201c This is Thomas Taylor, Major in the Terran Marines. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. Is there anyone on this frequency? \u201d \n \n There might be of course. This was Prior space after all \u2013 we thought. The *Galactic Explorer* had emerged from FTL and begun sweeping for signs of the enigmatic race. Then something had gone wrong with the fusion cells. I \u2019 d been in the observation blister watching the emergence, looking in completely the wrong direction. \n \n The explosion had ripped the *Explorer* open like a knife through butter, and I was the only one able to get to the emergency locker in time. Even then, I was pretty sure some parts of me had gotten frostbite. My left foot was numb and I was hoping it was just a circulation thing. \n \n \u201c Repeating, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday \u201d \n \n As if any alien race would even understand what that meant. And there weren \u2019 t any other Terran ships out this way. Who I was calling precisely was an academic question. I supposed it was more a matter of keeping myself sane. \n If there had been any other survivors, they would have heard my first call and replied by now. I refused to think about what the silence signified. \n \n Fifteen minutes of air left. The Orion Nebula set to my left, sliding out of sight. \n \n Hell, I do n't think we'd have even got any signals back from the scan. This system could be deserted. Space is so mind-bogglingly big that there could be a crowded intra-system shipping lane a million kilometers away and I wouldn \u2019 t even notice it. \n \n \u201c This is Major Taylor of the Terran Marines, assigned to Terran Survey Ship *Galaxy Explorer*. Ship in distress. Assistance required. \u201d \n \n My ears popped. It was cold in the suit, but that ran a new shudder down my spine. Air pressure was dropping. I brought the arm controls up again and ran some fast mental calculations. *Shit*. \n \n I didn \u2019 t have fifteen minutes, I had less than ten. There must be another leak in my suit somewhere. Maybe that explained where this rotation had come from. \n \n The helmet of a spacesuit isn \u2019 t designed for looking around, so I couldn \u2019 t tell where the leak was. \n \n \u201c Major Taylor to anyone. I am floating free in space. Assistance required immediately \u201d \n \n I began mentally cataloguing all the people I would never see again. Commander Hadley. Captain Schofield. Sarah, still waiting at home with Cally for a father that would never return. I could almost see them, almost hear the stories Cally was telling Sarah about her dad the Space Hero. I was going to disappoint them\u2026and for some reason, that scared me more than the slowly dropping oxygen meter. \n \n As I lowered the arm control from my tenth check in as many seconds, movement flickered. There! Against the edge of the Orion Nebula, a dark shape seemed to slip silently past. \n \n \u201c Emergency! Emergency! This is Major Taylor of the Terran Marines requesting immediate assistance! \u201d \n \n The shape slid out of view. Had I really seen anything? Was it a part of the *Galactic Explorer*? An asteroid at just the wrong angle? A Prior ship? \n \n Conspiracy theories began running through my mind. The Asian Alliance was building its own explorers, as was the European Unity. Maybe it was one of them? Did they sabotage the *Explorer* so they could contact the Priors first? Surely they wouldn \u2019 t just leave someone out here in space. \n \n Or would they? The evidence would be conveniently lost for eternity in the abyss. \n \n Was it the Priors? We knew so little about them \u2013 might they have destroyed the ship rather than talk? Had we been attacked? I didn \u2019 t recall seeing any missile traces, and there hadn \u2019 t been any alarms. But if they were as advanced as we thought, then would they even use missiles? \n \n Five minutes of air. \n \n \u201c Major Tom to anyone in the system. I surrender. \u201d \n \n Long shot, I know. There was only the crackle of the star \u2019 s fusion. \n \n \u201c Major Tom to anyone on this frequency. Respond please. \u201d \n \n Nothing. On the bright side, I could feel my left foot again. It was tingling. So were my fingers for that matter. Really, was anything worth it anymore? I was so tired. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m going to be dead in three minutes. If anyone is there. Please respond! \u201d \n \n That one actually sounded a little whiny. But I was happy about it. Too happy. Hypoxia. I tapped the adrenaline booster \u2013 a last resort in case of emergencies. It took me three tries to hit the command, and after I did, I immediately regretted it. So much for the \u2018 drifting off \u2019 method of death. I \u2019 d just narrowed it down to slow and lingering or slower and lingering. Smart move man, smart move. \n \n The Nebula rotated into view again. Was there a sign of the black shape? Was that it there? No, just a gap in the filaments. Was it? Had I imagined it from the beginning? \n \n \u201c Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. \u201d \n \n That one was harder to speak. My tongue felt thick and a severe headache was developing. Less than one minute of air. \n \n Then blessedly - lights. Lights in the shape of a ship, hanging against the dark less than a hundred meters away. Then they faded and turned into stars. Or did they? I struggled to concentrate \u2013 was there something there or not!? \n \n I felt irrationally angry. \n \n \u201c Fine you bastards! Fine! Leave me here to die! You \u2019 ve made an enemy of humanity today! We \u2019 re going to keep coming and coming and coming!

Run till you can \u2019 t run anymore, because that \u2019 s when we \u2019 ll catch you! \u201d \n \n The suit indicator was blinking red. There was a buzzing in my ears and the blackness of space was somehow getting blacker. \n \n \u201c Mayday. May\u2026day. May\u2026.. \u201d \n\n"}

Perhaps it's a fair trade, considering I can read minds, manipulate energy and matter with my mind, and also I'm immortal. No big deal right? \n `` Your turn to get coffee today Sam.'' Samantha groggily commands as she walks past me to her cubicle. I was feeling particularly feisty today, and try to get a look at that ass. Samantha is pretty hot, and I've always sorta had a crush on her since I started working here. If I did n't have to hide my superpowers I doubt it'd be any effort to get her to fall for me. Bitches love superpowers. \n \n But yeah, like I was saying, I try get a look at dat ass. And as I'm obviously looking at her ass, she turns around half way through saying `` Make mine a skinny'' and catches me red hand- red eyed? \n `` Umm sorry I was just looking at the floor in front of you and you walked where I was looking.'' I stutter, reminiscent of a cringey greentext tale from 4chan. \n `` Well, if you decided you wanted to look at my ass, I'd be fine with that.'' She says, before smiling at me and entering her cubicle. \n \n Holy FUCK! \n The excitement is TOO MUCH! \n Paper and sheets fly into the air as I involuntarily release a huge wave of energy, destroying all electronics and blowing all the lights. \n \n The office is dark now, besides the early morning light coming through the frost covered windows on this shallow winter day. The muffled sound of a car alarm can be heard from somewhere on the street outside. \n What surprises me most is that nobody has said anything. I stand up from my cubicle expecting to see or hear my fellow workers wondering what the fuck happened. The isles between the cubicles are empty. Hesitantly, I enter Samantha's cubicle, to find an inside out corpse, ribcage and intestines mangled together, ugly eyeballs torn from their sockets. \n \n Shocked, I check the other cubicles. Everyone is dead. \n Thank god, I do n't have to talk to Samantha again. That would be too much for me.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] It is believed that the cure for cancer has been discovered on Mars , astronauts have only one chance to bring it home where they hope to duplicate its properties for mass distribution\n","story":"`` Dr. Edmunds, something interesting came up on the latest screen,'' stated Johannes, the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism. \n \n `` This better be good. My grant proposal is due Friday,'' stated Edmunds, finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes. He quickly glanced at the ground, concealing his surprise. Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual. His face started to burn. Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund's office without scheduling an appointment. Luckily, Johannes' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention. She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray, hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled. He must have been working double shifts. \n \n `` I-If this is what I think it is, you'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money,'' Johannes replied. `` I repeated this experiment three times, always in triplicates. Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001. In other words, there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation, and --'' \n \n `` Let me see,'' she interrupted. Johannes passed her the sheets of data. Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward, brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers. \n \n Sample 1215: at long last, a positive hit. \n \n A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund's face, then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin. Eyes shining, she said, `` We spent five years at the edge of this colony, hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth....'' here, a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart. She coughed violently, spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth. Pulling away, spots of blood were seen. She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief. There were n't many unstained areas left on the fabric. The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest. \n \n Johannes offered her water, which she gratefully sipped. After a pause, she continued. `` We took a risk being here. They said we could n't find anything by the mines. But that ended up being our advantage. What was Sample 1215?'' \n \n Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement. `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines. There is life down there, likely bacterial in origin, and it is producing this compound in great quantities. Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth, though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins,'' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth. `` When given to cancer cells *in vitro*, it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells. In the animal model, this compound appears to stop angiogenesis. In other words, in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity, it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor.'' \n \n Edmunds slowly stood, smile unwavering. `` You have made a remarkable discovery, Johannes. You will finally be able to graduate with your Ph.D., with nothing less than the highest honors.'' \n \n `` Thank you, Dr. Edmunds. Without your direction, this would n't have been possible,'' Johannes replied, bowing his head. A shadow crept over his face. There was a hesitating silence before he continued. `` I... I knew about your condition all along. The cancer you tried to keep secret. The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth. The way you are now....There is n't much time.'' \n \n Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement. It was foolish of her to think the others would n't have noticed by now. \n \n `` I can give you the first treatment,'' Johannes said, looking up to meet Edmunds' eyes. `` It might give you more time. Enough to see that we take it home over the years.'' \n \n Her eyes looked past Johannes towards the window, beyond the red terrain and into the sky. `` Yes, I would like that very much. But that ca n't be the focus now. I did n't tell anyone this, but there's only going to be one more trip from the Colony to go home. Back on Earth, people have given up so much hope that they do n't want to allocate anymore resources to us. The grant I have been writing was for a separate project that can be done on Earth.'' \n \n `` What?!'' Johannes blurted loudly. `` There is only one chance to take home a cure we only discovered this month? For all of the people affected on Earth? How can we manage that?'' \n \n Edmunds sighed. The weariness she felt was not only physical. `` What we will do is find the organism producing Compound 1215, and find out the conditions it best grows in. Then, we will see if we can mimic those conditions on Earth. If we can grow the bacteria on Earth, we can produce the cure there. I want this done in six months. That is when you all will be scheduled to leave.'' \n \n `` Just wait a second -- what do you mean,'you all'? Are n't you going also?'' Johannes said. He pulled a chair from the desk. His head was spinning. \n \n Edmunds smiled sadly. `` When I came here, I never expected I would actually return. There's nothing left for me on Earth.'' Her gaze drifted to a framed picture on her desk, of a smiling family. Edmunds was once a young wife, with a husband and three children. `` I'll carry on work here for as long as I can, and relay information to you from here. It was my hope that *you* would personally take over my work. You were always my favorite student....It is your choice, of course....But should this grant get approved, your scientific career will be set.'' \n \n Johannes stood once again, his face hardened and determined. `` I had better get to work, then.'' He smiled. \n\n"}

No one can tell me why my hearing mysteriously disappeared 10 years ago. I've been poked and prodded by a thousand different doctors all over the world and not a one can even give me a diagnosis. My parents tried everything they could but to no avail, which resulted in me learning sign language to communicate. It also caused all my friends to distance themselves from me. No one had time to bother learning sign language when there were boys and makeup and parties to deal with. Once a popular girl, I quickly became ostracized and learned to spend much time by myself. \n \n As I got older, I became more accustomed to my situation and learned how to make friends in my own way. I still spent a lot of time by myself but it did n't bother me in the least. After getting a job as an editorial assistant in New York City, I moved to Hoboken and spent much of my time exploring and learning. I soaked up as much as I could read, becoming interested in all sorts of subjects. It caused me to become habitually distracted when I would traverse my way through the city. That was how I met Oscar. \n \n As I walked along the street, I scrolled through my phone and only glanced up occasionally to make sure I was n't about to walk into the middle of traffic. While distracted by an interesting article from MIT about immune engineering, I ran into something or someone solid and began to fall. I let out a small screech and flailed my arms in an attempt to keep upright. Unfortunately, the first thing my fingers grabbed was someone's arm. I pulled them down with me and they landed on top of me, knocking the wind out of me. Damn, they were solid. \n \n My victim scrambled off of me and to their feet in panic. I glanced up to see an athletic looking man with slightly curly brown hair, a brown tweed jacket and square glasses perched on his nose offering me his hand. \n \n `` Are you okay?'' he asked. \n \n I stared at him in shock, ignoring his extended hand. Had I just heard him speak or was it my imagination? \n \n `` Um, miss? Are you okay?'' he asked again, beginning to look uncomfortable. \n \n I took his hand and he helped me up, my face still frozen in wonderment. Everything else around me was silent except for him. I did n't hear the sounds of traffic or the city or the whispers of those around us who had witnessed my clumsiness. \n \n `` I can hear you!'' I said to him in hushed tones of amazement. \n \n He releasing my hand, he gave me a confused look. \n \n `` You can hear me?'' he repeated. \n \n `` Yes!'' \n \n I knew I was speaking loudly. I tended to do that since losing my hearing because I was unable to determine how loud I was actually talking. But even if I did know, I would have still spoken loudly. It had been almost 11 years since I physically heard someone else's voice. \n \n `` Ummm.'' \n \n `` I've been fully deaf for the last 10 years,'' I told him, excitedly. `` Your voice is the only voice I've heard since I lost my hearing.'' \n \n The man's eyes widened and a his mouth formed a small'o' in surprise. I needed to know this man. He could be the only person in the world I could ever hear. \n \n `` I'm Maise. This is going to sound unbelievably strange and slightly awkward but, will you come get coffee with me?'' I asked. \n \n `` Oh, wow. You're right, that is slightly awkward and unbelievably strange,'' he said, one hand running through his mop of curls and the other gripping his messenger bag strap nervously. \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' I said, tumbling over my words. `` It's just been so long since I've heard someone's voice. I -- I need to speak with you. Please.'' \n \n `` I mean, I guess I could,'' he said, extending his hand. `` I'm Oscar.'' \n \n Later, in the dimness of my favorite coffee shop, I stared at Oscar in wonder as he told me about himself. He was a high school English teacher who also lived in Hoboken with a cat and an annoying roommate. I barely picked at my muffin as I just listened to the sound that flowed from his mouth. His voice had a pleasant timbre to it, though, to be honest, even it if were the worst voice in the world I would have loved it. \n \n `` I know I'm making a total fool of myself,'' I told him when he paused for breath. `` But I could listen to you talk all day.'' \n \n Oscar let out a cheerful laugh and smiled. \n \n `` Well, this is certainly turning out to be an interesting day,'' he said. `` You speak very well for being deaf.'' \n \n As happy I was to be able to hear someone speak, I could n't help but roll my eyes. Everyone seemed to think all deaf people had difficulty speaking. \n \n `` Most people ares surprised that I speak so clearly, but I did have 15 years of hearing and speaking. I'm deaf, not stupid.'' \n \n Oscar winced slightly at my comment. \n \n `` And blunt,'' he added, taking a sip of his coffee. \n \n `` Yeah, force of habit,'' I said, draining the last of my drink. Peeking at my watch, I saw it was late. `` Yikes, I do n't want to miss the next train home. Wan na head back to Jersey?'' \n \n He nodded and got to his feet, throwing out our cups and opening the door for me. When we got outside, I stopped and turned to face him. \n \n `` Oscar, I desperately want to be your friend.'' \n \n He offered me his arm. \n \n `` Well, Maise, I think I would like that.'' \n \n I could hear the smile in his voice, not just see the one that was dazzling me. I let out a laugh. I could hear someone.\n"}

Too stoned to listen, I deliberately dropped the empty beer can from my hand and let it rattle down the roof tiles into his nice rose bushes. `` The view is too pretty, dear'', I announce loudly enough for him to hear, though no longer looking at him. Alexander was a handsome man, an interesting combination of his father and my brother, though I never saw either of them with grey in their hair or crow's feet at the corners of their eyes. \n \n `` Mom'', little Alex started again, sounding increasingly irritated, `` the view has been the same for the last five years.

It felt like someone suddenly flipped a switch somewhere in my brain, and turned off my legs. I was rushed to the hospital, of course. I must've fallen asleep at some point, or I simply forgot, but the next thing I remember is lying in a bed, with a doctor poking needles in my legs. He then took my parents into the hallway, and a few moments later I heard my mom scream hysterically. My dad walked back into the room with tears in his eyes. \n \n It turned out I have a rare autoimmune disease that targets my peripheral nervous system. In short, my body attacks its own nervous system, resulting in ( partial ) paralysis, or worse. After a few weeks in the hospital, and several dozens of tests, they told me I was one of the lucky ones. After weeks of rehabilitation I was finally able to walk again. I was sent home. I do n't think I ever saw my parents so happy, my sister was literally crying when I walked through the door. I felt like I was invincible. Even now, after all those years, I sometimes wish I could relive that moment just one more time. \n \n Unfortunately, it turned out I was n't exactly invincible after all, and every few years or so, my immune system would kick into overdrive again, and the whole story would repeat from the beginning. Falling. Hospital. Rehabilitation. Falling. Hospital. Rehabilitation. An endless cycle of hope and despair. I never was much of a learner, but I missed so many days in school that my grades plummeted. I barely saw my friends anymore, as I could n't play outside, even in my better days. Especially going through puberty was hell, though because of my wheelchair I got treated quite nicely in school, so I had that going for me. Though as a more or less permanent wheelchair-bound teenager with little to no social life, I could have probably starred on the cover of *Troubled* magazine. \n \n The depressions started around that time as well. Whole days went by when I could do nothing except lying in bed, alone with my thoughts, and feeling powerless. Staring into a black pit of uselessness, having no desire to do anything at all, and feeling like all the joy and happiness in the world had been sucked out of me. Even as puberty made way for adulthood, the depression stayed. In fact, I think it got worse as years went by. My parents, my sister, probably knew. I realised that they took extra care to be nice to me, to try and make me feel happy, and somewhere deep down I appreciated their effort. I did n't show it, however. In fact, the more they tried to engage with me, the more they tried to find a way to make me feel happy, to make me feel me again, the more I pushed them away. \n \n I first tried to commit suicide when I was 21. I had just had another episode, and though I managed to walk again after an especially gruelling period of rehabilitation, I felt more empty than ever. This time it lasted for weeks. Weeks in which I wanted nothing less than to just step out of life. Leave all of my misery behind and be done with it all. One night, I decided to empty the medicine cabinet, took a bottle of whisky to wash it all down, and lay down to die. \n \n I woke up in the hospital the next day, having apparently made a full recovery. This time, however, there was no party. And though I thought I could see some glint of happiness in the eyes of my father and sister, the emptiness my mother left overshadowed it all. She found me the previous night, just in time, and... Sigh, I guess it's no use dredging up the whole past. I think it's sufficient to say that the events threw me into an even deeper depression, and no family, nor professional help, could save me from it. \n \n I died the year after. Well, technically speaking at least, I was gone for a few minutes. My dad was the one who died instead. One moment I was sitting in my car, my favourite music playing, my eyes glazing over as the sweet carbon monoxide fumes entered my car. The next moment I woke up on the couch in the living room, with the lifeless body of my dad besides me. I guess he came home early that day. \n \n I felt so, so selfish after that. My parents had loved me, had literally sacrificed their future to save me, and I could n't live with that guilt. I wanted nothing more than to scream out, to curse the heavens and all that dwelt beneath them for this damned life that was given to me. Wanted nothing more than to give it back. Instead, for these past few years, I have continued to live, lived without looking back, because I am afraid afraid that the moment I do, I see my parents standing behind me. And the sad thing is, I know they would n't mock me, I know they would n't judge me. No, they loved me too much to do so. Instead, they would probably smile that damned supportive smile of them, and tell me that it is all okay. That it is all going to be fine... \n \n The problem is, I know it's not. The past days, I have had this increasing, familiar sensation of numbness in my fingers. My left leg has been asleep for the past week. Deep down, I know that this time, the paralysis will not go away, nor will it be contained to my legs. I have tried... My god, have I tried to live, but this is just too much. And so I drove to this bridge tonight, and so I'm standing here on the railing, not allowing death to creep up on me, like the last times, but looking him straight in the eyes. The dark waters below already ripple and rage, a thousand arms, waiting to embrace me. \n \n I feel my parents' eyes look upon me, but I do n't want to meet their gaze. I think I hear them calling me in the distance. If I look back I'll back down. No, I let go. After an excruciating moment of doubt, I let go. \n \n A familiar feeling of helplessness returns to me, but I feel more alive now than I have in the past years. The approaching darkness below beckons me, promising that this time, I wo n't wake up. Its icy grip pulls me closer. I find myself smiling, for the first time in god knows how long. Peace at last. \n \n Somewhere in the distance, I hear my sister screaming my name...\n"}

East Coast USA was landlocked now- it faced continental winds from Siberia and was reduced to a cold hell and a landscape that used to be associated with Mongolia or the Atacama- or Mars for that matter. \n \n West Coast was n't doing so well either. The Antarctic landmass had shifted North crushing into South Africa and submerging Mozambique. When the icecap melted in the tropical waters it turned there was n't so much of an Antarctic landmass to begin with. It had all been a bunch of small, closely connected islands underneath the icecaps. Like a toupee covering a patchy balding head. The sea levels rose with the lost ice and California was submerged. Then the temperatures rose because of the lost albido and the people of Nevada, who'd purchased newly created beachfront property in what used to be barren desert, were n't so happy when it got submerged too and the new coastline was just short of Salt Lake City, Utah. \n \n That's where I would've gone, until I read the latest issue of Nature. It turns out that almost the entirety of Canada and what used to be Central Europe was being covered icecaps to become a new, greater Arctic continent. That meant the water would seen recede and the property rates of Utah would plunge down to levels where they deserved to be. \n \n Land was not a problem, frankly. There were n't as many people around. Drinking water, electricity and working sewage, however, were things to look out for.

Why ?\n","story":"I often make poor decisions. \n \n My friend, Ethan, suggested that I learn the bass, some time ago. \n \u201c It suits your style. \u201d Was what he said, and nothing else. Of course, why would there be a reason for an explanation? Especially now, when we could simply take all that potential years of practice, and study \u2013 years of wasting away, and download it straight to your brain. It was a convenient and effortless way to just do, without all the hassle and frustration. \n It was easy. \n \n But I had all the time in the world. So I decided to work on it. \n \n It was a winter morning, the breeze was cool and refreshing and it had a zesty smell that I find hard to describe. I was sitting by the porch with Ethan, plucking away on my bass as he sat beside me, watching as he smoked. He watched as I pluck clumsily with my right hand and my left gliding across the fret board, trying to play a simple tune. It did n't sound so impressive, but that didn \u2019 t matter to me. \n \n I was enjoying it regardless. \n \n He took a deep puff. He shook his head and tried to speak as the smoke barely crawled out of his mouth. \n \n \u201c Look, Nate. I asked you to learn the bass, but I didn \u2019 t think you \u2019 d do it like this. \u201d He said. \n \n I stopped, and turned to him. \u201c What are you talking about? It \u2019 s better this way. \u201d \n \n \u201c But it \u2019 s a waste of time. You could \u2019 ve been a proper bassist long ago if you \u2019 d just download the damned skill. \u201d He drew another puff and blew rings out of his mouth. \n \n \u201c You just don \u2019 t know how to appreciate some things in life. \u201d \n \n He grew impatient. Just that kind of guy I suppose. He has been within an earshot as I practiced for about a year now. He listened as I played, and often joked about how slow my progress was. But at least he said so himself. It was slow, but I was making progress. \n \n But then he got cocky. \n \n He finished his cigarette and turned time with a grin on his face. He cleared his throat. \u201c Okay how about we do this, \u201d He began. \u201c Tonight, I will download just the basics on playing bass. And we \u2019 ll face off tomorrow, in front of our other pals. \u201d \n Of course, I looked at him with a raised brow. \u201c Are you serious? \u201d \n \u201c Yea, dead serious, \u201d He replied. \u201c I \u2019 m going to show you that I \u2019 ll make more progress overnight, than you in several months. And then finally you \u2019 d cut the crap and download it like everyone else in the world. \u201d \n I knew. It was obvious, because it would be easy. Just like that, he would surpass me at my level of knowledge playing the bass. I would have just swallowed my pride and give a half-hearted laugh. But I guess I was cocky too. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re on. \u201d I said \u201c I \u2019 ll make you eat those words, asshole. \u201d \n \u201c Then it \u2019 s settled. \u201d He stood and walked away. \u201c I \u2019 m going to get started on this cake walk. I \u2019 m bouncing, dickhead. \u201d He waved at me, wearing that smug grin on his face. \n \n How I wish he \u2019 d wipe it off. \n That day came quicker than I imagined. It was as if time was set on fast-forward, so eager to watching me embarrass myself in front of my friends. I had little sleep, I spent all night practicing, and being frustrated at the mistakes I made. I simply played, and played, and played, until I lost track of time. And here I am, standing in front of the group, tired, bass gripped firmly in hand. \n \n I regret not swallowing my pride. \n Ethan made his way toward me. He examined me and let out a laugh. \u201c Nate, you don \u2019 t look so good. \u201d \n He extended a hand, asking for the bass. I forgot he didn \u2019 t have one. I tried my best not to turn and run, that would only make me look like a coward. I passed it to him half-heartedly. He leaned close to me and looked me in the eye. \n \n \u201c Let me show you what you could \u2019 ve been months ago. \u201d \n \n And he did. He did just that. The technique he displayed, the rhythm, the tune. It was excellent. It wasn \u2019 t just the basics. I could tell. He went and one upped me and downloaded the advance skillset just because he could. The thumps were clear and crisp, his hands glided across the board gracefully, and his fingers crawled across each note with precision and agility. \n \n I felt the colour drain from my face. What in the hell was I thinking? That was the worst moment of my life. By the end of it, he had our friends laughing and cheering. And looked at me with confidence, confidence he very well much didn \u2019 t deserve. It was unfair. \n Because of how easy it was. \n \n He walked toward me and handed the bass over. He saw his lips move but I very much wasn \u2019 t listening at that point. But I saw his lips, and by the way it moved, I made it out as a taunt. \n \n \u201c Have fun. \u201d \n \n He pushed me in front of the crowd. I was quivering, nervous. I don \u2019 t want to do this anymore. I felt all eyes on me so I might as well get this over with. \n \n I began to play. \n I fumbled with the strings. I barely made out a solid note. But I played anyway. I kept playing. I played as if no one was watching me, as if no one was listening. I just shut it out, the whole world, until it was just me. Then I remembered why I did it this way, the long route. \n It was actually kind of fun. \n At that point I stopped caring. I just played what I knew, played what I can. My technique could still use some work, my sound wasn \u2019 t as crisp, and the rhythm was a bit off. But I found myself moving with it anyway. I felt a smile start to form on my face. And then I heard clapping synced to my playing. I turned and saw Ethan, still with his smug grin, still with his confident flair. \n Clapping to the tunes I played. \n Then the small crowd followed suit. They were really enjoying themselves, alongside me. I played for what seemed like an hour, stopped for short breaks and then I would play again. It was getting dark, and the crowd thinned one by one. \n \n Ethan was the last to leave. He waved as he walked. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m bouncing, dickhead! \u201d He yelled. \n \n \u201c Yea, later. Asshole! \u201d I yelled back. \n \n I was outplayed. I felt as though the time I spent was for nothing. But that never mattered, it never mattered at all. At the end of the day, I had fun. And that was good enough for me. But sounding the way Ethan did? That was awesome. I guess maybe, I should push a little harder. \n It was a winter morning, the breeze was cool as always, and smelled the same. And here I am still sitting by the porch plucking away on my bass, Ethan still sitting beside me, smoking and watching, enjoying this little clumsy tune. \n The clumsy tune no string of data could produce; the passion that accompanies it. \n \n \u201c It really does suit you, Nate. \u201d Ethan looked at me with a grin on his face. \u201c But it doesn \u2019 t help that your progress is too damned slow. \u201d \n I laughed it off, and plucked away. \n \n I often make poor decisions. I guess this one wasn \u2019 t so bad. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ IP ] Merman\n","story":"He knows it's a bad idea, yet his tail seems to be moving of its own accord, pushing him closer to the surface. He breaks it with barely a splash, years of practice guiding his sleek form. \n \n Well, years of practice might be a slight exaggeration. He's only been a fully-grown merman for about a year, and no one really counts the years before you turn 20. \n \n He looks around carefully, trying to hide his fair hair in the foam of the choppy waves. No matter how much he tells himself he's not looking for her, his tail twitches when he finally spots her ship, a few hundred yards from him. It does n't seem to be moving, so there's probably a research diver in the water. He makes a mental note to be careful. \n \n He thinks he's being sneaky, approaching the ship under the surface, trying not to disturb the water any more than the wind already is. He knows his tail sometimes glints and glimmers, the sun reflecting off his silver scales, but people generally dismiss that as fish. No one really believes in merfolk anymore, and they're happy to keep it that way. Their lives are much quieter now. Much less violent. \n \n He surfaces near the small observation deck at the back of the research vessel, thinking he's succeeded in staying out of sight until a voice cuts through the familiar sound of the rolling waves. \n \n `` You know I can see you, right?'' \n \n His every instinct is telling him to run, to drop under the surface and swim away, but he stays put. She's sitting on the deck, bare legs hanging over the edge. The water is cold, but she does n't seem to mind. \n \n `` Wait, you can talk, ca n't you?'' She's got one hand in a jacket pocket, the other fiddling with her braid. `` I do n't know why, I just assumed you could talk. I've been trying to get closer to you for a while now, but it never occurred to me that maybe you could n't talk. That's dumb.'' \n \n `` Uh,'' he says, and immediately wants to duck under the surface again. *Yeah, good job*, he thinks. *So articulate*. \n \n He tries again. `` I can talk.'' *Smooth*. \n \n `` Hey, cool!'' she says with a smile. `` Learning a mermaid language would be a pain in the ass, probably. I'd likely end up not even being able to pronounce half the sounds.'' \n \n `` How would you even learn one?'' he asks. `` I do n't know much about the human world, but I'm pretty sure you do n't have a whole lot of information on mermaids, let alone mermaid languages. That stuff went out of style centuries ago.'' \n \n `` I did n't really think it through, seeing as it only occurred to me after I found out you could, in fact, talk. We could have had an inspirational teaching-each-other movie montage, I do n't know.'' \n \n `` What's a movie montage?'' he asks. \n \n She frowns a little. Clearly, he's asked something stupid, and he's about to take the question back when she pulls a small box out of her pocket. It's in a plastic bag, and one side lights up when she presses a button. \n \n `` It's easier to just show you,'' she says by way of explanation, completely glossing over what the box is as if he should already know. This whole encounter is already a lot to take in, so he decides it's probably magic and trying to understand it might make his head explode. \n \n The girl is tapping at the lit side of the box, and finally turns it towards him. There are images of people on the box. Then she taps it one more time, and the people start moving, and he starts. It's definitely magic. \n \n `` Shit, I did n't even realise how weird that would be for you,'' the girl says, putting the box away. `` Let's just leave it at that.'' \n \n `` Is it magic?'' he feels compelled to ask, because it never hurts to confirm things. \n \n `` Um, something like that.'' \n \n He's bobbing along to the waves, trying to think of something else to say, when she speaks up again. \n \n `` You know, I have n't told anyone about you.'' \n \n He must look confused, because she clarifies. `` Anyone on the ship. They're looking for undiscovered life underwater, but I've seen you a few times and you're always trying to hide, so I figured you did n't want anyone to know about you.'' \n \n `` Besides,'' he adds, `` it's not like we're undiscovered life underwater, more like once discovered and re-lost.'' He does n't say it, but he's grateful, and he hopes she can hear it in his tone. \n \n `` How long ago was that? Do you remember much of it?'' she asks. Her genuine curiosity is apparent, but he sputters, almost choking on seawater. Which is embarrassing, because he's known how to surface since he was five years old. \n \n `` How old do you think I am?'' he asks, slight indignation in his voice, and she blushes. \n \n `` Look, I do n't know, in all the stories the merman always has a crisis because the girl is like sixteen and he's entire centuries old and he thinks it's immoral.'' \n \n `` There are stories? Still?'' \n \n `` That's the part you decided to focus on?'' she asks, laughing. `` Yes, there are stories. Always with the age crisis, I guess they used to think it was romantic or something.'' \n \n `` How do the stories end?'' \n \n `` Usually, the girl seduces the merman into disregarding their age difference, and something magical happens and the girl goes to live with the merfolk and everyone lives happily ever after.'' \n \n This time, he actually does choke on seawater. `` That's... that's not how that works. Humans ca n't live underwater. That kind of magic does n't exist.'' \n \n They've been joking around until now, tones light, but his comment kills the mood. \n \n `` Yeah, well, your realism makes for crappy stories.'' She shrugs. `` So how old are you, then?'' \n \n `` I'm 21. So there's no need to have a crisis. About the age thing, at least.'' \n \n She looks to be a little younger than him, but she does n't offer her age, and he does n't ask. They both know it wo n't matter in the end, because it's like he said: humans ca n't live underwater. \n \n `` What if I seduced you anyway?'' she asks. `` Completely independently of any age agenda.'' He's a little bit impressed that she can say that and still keep a straight face. She's not even blushing any more. \n \n `` It would n't be very difficult,'' he says truthfully, and she grins. `` But...'' her face falls, but she looks resigned, like she knows what he's about to say. And she does. \n \n `` But humans ca n't live underwater,'' she supplies. \n \n `` It's already going to be hard enough to swim away from you,'' he says. `` Let's not make it any harder than it has to be.'' \n \n `` Fine,'' she says with a sigh, `` you're right. You should probably go.'' \n \n He surges up to kiss her, lips barely touching hers before he's gone, disappeared under the waves. \n \n It's only as he's swimming back towards the bottom that he realises he never even asked her name. \n \n \n \n \n ** [ OT ]: ** I updated the prompt a little, I hope that's allowed! this is my first post here so I was n't sure. also, side note, learning a mermaid language would be cool. \n \n\n"}

I frantically thought. `` No! Not again NO!'' \n My vision went white and I felt dizzy, as if the world was spinning around me. I wanted to reach out and grab something, but my hand only grasped empty space. My breath was gone, I could n't breathe, my chest hurt and my eyes, despite being shut against the throbbing in my head, felt as though they were going to burst from my skull. \n And then suddenly, everything went still. The pain subsided, the throbbing ceased, and I could breathe. I took a shakey breath, inhaling the scent of slightly burnt toast. \n'' Please, please... `` I silently begged, and opened my eyes. \n The first thing I saw, as I realized I was looking down, was a faded multi-color braided rug. Cautiously I lifted my right foot, and saw the perfectly worn pattern that matched it. I knew automatically that if I had looked under the other foot, there would be a matching pattern for the left. My heart sank. So it had happened again, after all. My despair was interupted, however, by a rough, but familiar voice. \n'' Welcome back, John. Tea is on the table, and I just finished the toast. You'll find the tea is still hot. You take cream still, I assume?'' \n I looked up from the rug and took stock of the room around me. It was a familiar parlor, with old, mismatched victorian furniture lining the room and various bookcases and curio cabinets filled with bric-a-brac of sorts. A fire was lit in a fireplace to my right, and there, on the mantle was a little gold aniversary clock, its weighted pendulums swinging back and forth. The time was nearly noon. Lunch time. Clock. Time. God, help me. \n Again I was brought out of my thoughts by sound of a throat clearing, and the clink of glass on glass. Looking forwar was an entryway opening to tiny kitchen and in the center, an older gentleman, drinking from an antique cup. Before him, was another setting. For me, as always. \n The mans name is Jeremy. He is what I considered to be an old friend, though, I do n't exactly know how long we have been friends. Because you see, I am a Traveler. As in Time Traveler. I look into a mirror and I have not the slightest idea how old I even am anymore. From the day after I started puberty, I have been thrust ahead into time, back into time, and it could be any number of time, not just years, sometimes minutes, days, I do n't honestly know anymore. But what I do know, is that there have only been two consistencies in my life; Jeremey, and this place. I have been so far back in time that once I was standing on dirt, but still, Jeremey was there, whether it was a cabin in the woods, or a clearing in the forest. He has always been here, as far I know, because Jeremey is immortal. \n I took a few unsteady steps and settled myself into the creaky chair before my friend. The cup of tea was warm against my hand, but my hand was too weak to lift it just yet. A lump formed in the back of my throat as I studied the lines in the wood table. \n'' Jeremey,'' I sighed, and my old friend answered, his voice deep and rumbling as an oak tree, without needing to be asked \n'' The year is 2015, the market is good, people are fat, but healthy for the most part in the so-called `` developed'' world, war is ever a problem, race is ever a problem.'' His eyes, ever blue and sparkling, glinted with the grin at the corner of his weathered face. `` I suppose you could say nothing has changed at all!'' \n He laughed lightly. Smiling. He was always this merry whenever I came to `` visit''. Yet I could not bring myself to smile. I felt sick to my stomach, and the lump in my throat burned until tears began to form in my eyes. Without any control, a sob shook my chest. Jeremey quickly set down his cup, his smile gone. \n'' My dear friend, what happened to you??'' \n'' Jeremey, I ca n't do this anymore.'' I gasped. Covering my face with my hand I wiped at my tears. God help me, I was trying to force back the misery in my chest as images flashed before my mind. \n'' Jesus Almighty, John, your hand! You've a ring on it! Do n't tell me you....'' \n Anger shook me. Why was this life thrust on me! Removing my hand, I stood suddenly, the chair toppeling backwards to the floor. Grabbing the porcelian cup on the table, the threw it violently into the wall behind Jeremey, who, despite my sudden actions, did n't even flinch. Why would he? Not like anything could hurt him anyhow. Unable to supress the feeling any longer, I moaned. \n'' I was happy! Jeremey!! HAPPY!'' \n'' You did it this time, you married! How long were you there, John?'' Whispered Jeremey, his concern written in every line on his face. \n'' It does n't matter!! I do n't know! Damnit! I was in LOVE! Her name was Joy and she, she was my life! God... god damnit. I need to go back!'' \n I had left the love of my life in the year of 1915, one hundred years ago in the past, alone. \n'' You know you ca n't do that, not knowingly --'' \n'' I KNOW THAT!'' I yelled. Of course I knew I could n't go back, I do n't control anything about time, no one does. But Joy, my poor Joy. What did she do without me? I had promised her my life, I had made so many promises to her, and I'd broken every one of them. We had been walking together down the city street, the Womans Sufferage had just allowed women to vote and she was going for the first time, she was so nervous but I told her I would be there, I promised. And then I had vanished. \n I wiped again at the tears that had wet my face. The pain in my heart subsided slightly, and I righted my chair to sit back down. Jeremey was silent for a moment, then stood, stepped over the broken glass on the floor to bring another cup from the cupboard. He poured me another cup of tea. \n'' How do you do it Jeremey?'' I sighed. `` Just how? For all I know you're Methusulath himself, but you ca n't tell me you have n't ever been in love. `` \n'' Ah,'' he said as he sat down again. `` I'm sorry, John. I am immortal, far as I know, but I am, I believe, human, and I have been in love. How do I do it? What is it to watch the ones you love decay before your eyes? To watch as plague whispers through your village and leaves all, but you for dead?

{"prompt":"[ WP ] When children are born , parents have to roll for stats .\n","story":"Colin and Felicity were the proudest of parents. Little Rupert had been born in perfect health. They had held each other and beamed as Rupert was transferred by the doctor into the genetic coding chamber. \n \n `` Are you ready to program your son?'' Asked the doctor with a smile. \n \n Colin and Felicity looked at each other nodding. `` Yes,'' said Felicity, grasping Colin's hand. `` Yes we are.'' \n \n Rupert was placed in the gene manipulation chamber. The machine had put an end to genetic disease overnight, as it allowed the traits of newborns to be selected by the parents. However, while dangerous genomes would automatically be modified,'luxury alterations' ( as they were known ) were effected by means of chance. \n \n Excessive populational perfection was deemed dangerous and undesirable by various governing bodies. So, parents would roll dice to determine how their child would develop. \n \n `` OK,'' said the doctor. The contraption looked like a vending machine, and he motioned to a hole that looked like something for dispensing change. `` Collect the dice from here,'' he said, `` and drop them in the hole up here. The machine will reveal the number of the roll, and that score will then represent the ability of your child in that particular area. Once you have the score, press next here and the dice will drop again.'' The doctor puffed out his cheeks and laughed. `` Any questions?'' \n \n `` No,'' said Colin, looking at Felicity. `` I think we've got it, thanks.'' \n \n `` Then over to you,'' he chirped. \n \n Alone in the room with his wife and child, Colin walked over to the machine, pressing his palm against the glass. Rupert looked perfect already. Felicity watched on from the bed. \n \n `` What is the first trait?'' She asked excitedly. \n \n `` Beauty,'' said Colin. He took the dice from the tray. `` Ready?'' He asked, looking back at Felicity. \n \n `` Yes, do it.'' She made a high pitched whine of excitement. \n \n Colin dropped the dice into the slot, heard some clicking, followed by a small rattle, and then a gulp. A digital display behind Rupert read'6'. \n \n `` Yeah!'' Shouted Colin. `` Six out of six! Our kid is going to be a looker!'' \n \n Both parents celebrated and wooped, they high-fived and hugged, and after a minute or two, having pressed'next', Colin was again collecting the dice. \n \n He turned around with a look of seriousness. Fiona looked suddenly concerned. \n \n `` Is there a problem?'' She asked. \n \n `` This next one is intelligence,'' said Colin soberly. \n \n Felicity gasped. `` Make sure you roll it well,'' she warned, and put her hands together and began to pray. \n \n Colin nodded, and turned back to the machine. He exhaled deeply. He dropped the dice in the hole - click, rattle, gulp - and the machine read'3'. \n \n `` What is it?'' Cried Felicity. \n \n `` Three,'' said Colin. For a moment there was silence. \n \n Felicity looked up with concentration. `` You know, three is n't too bad, Colin?'' \n \n Colin pondered the score. `` No, I suppose not.'' \n \n `` After all,'' said Felicity, `` Jerry's boy rolled low for intelligence! Margaret told me so'' \n \n `` Jerry's boy?'' Said Colin incredulously. `` Well he seems perfectly bright to me...'' \n \n `` Well exactly,'' said Felicity. `` And our Rupert has a three! That's not even low! It's middle of the road!'' \n \n `` Middle of the road...'' Parroted Colin with wonder. He suddenly felt quite pleased with himself and pressed'next' with renewed optimism. \n \n A four followed for empathy, which was greeted at first with a cheer from Felicity, and a dubious expression from Colin. But as Felicity pointed out, Jerry's boy rolled low for empathy, and he was quite the unfeeling trouble maker. The smile quickly returned to Colin's face. \n \n Then for narcissism Rupert received a five. Belinda had positively bragged about her girl scoring a two for that. Felicity was certain about it. And here was Rupert scoring a five! Both parents were utterly joyous. \n \n Duty came in at one, and both parents agreed that to have a stuffy dutiful son would be a crying shame. Rupert would play with wild abandon, just as nature intended for the child. Joy began turning to rapture. \n \n Next was happiness which scored at three. At this both parents agreed that constant play could be a little tiring after all, and that the occasional bad mood might come as something of a relief. And plus, joy and sadness were both pigments in the painting of life, and much beauty could be missed for the want of one of them. Their elation was sustained. \n \n In their eyes it could not have gone more perfectly. At that point Colin and Felicity agreed to press the glowing red button. It read:'Leave the Rest to Nature'. \n \n As the doctor returned to the room, the happy couple lay blissfully in each others arms, chatting airily about their beautiful son who was intelligent enough, unshackled by duty, and perfectly narcissistic. \n \n `` We want to take him home,'' they said to the doctor. \n \n `` He'll be ready to go along with you in no time at all,'' he replied benignly. `` These machines are really very fast nowadays.'' \n \n `` Thank you doctor,'' said the couple together, heads resting on one another. \n \n They had just began to doze off when the machine let out a soft ping, and the perspex shield slid across. The doctor lifted Rupert, wrapped him in a white shawl, and handed him to Colin and Felicity. \n \n The new family, now together, shared in a few minutes of total contentment, before leaving with hearts that overflowed with love and promise. \n \n Once they were gone, the perspex door closed again. As it quietly clicked shut in the empty room, a second dice came unstuck, and fell next to the first in the tray.\n"}

He was born in a space station and it suited him. \n \n He sucked on a packet labeled `` macaroni'' as he initialized the computer boot sequence and opened up the windows. Their destination was the star that the planet Veritas orbited, so this would be one of the only opportunities to see it before the light was too much. \n \n Humanity had spent many years discovering and eventually manufacturing the wormholes that would enable intersystem travel, even for *Homo sapien sapien sapien. * Seven planets had been colonized, with Veritas being the second.

She screamed as his blood splattered all over him. \n \n `` Why! Wo n't! You! Die!'' \n \n Mark snatched the pipe from her and bent it in half. \n \n `` My question is, why, Jess? I thought you loved me?'' \n \n `` I never loved you! I hate you! I just want your money!'' \n \n Mark looked hurt. All he wanted was love. \n \n `` Is that why you took out the insurance policy? You wanted to kill me?'' \n \n `` Exactly, Mark! There's two million dollars in it for me!'' \n \n Sighing, Mark sat down and hung his head. \n \n `` You know, you're not the first to try this. To be exact, you're the twenty third.'' \n \n `` Twenty third?'' \n \n `` Yep. Every time I fall in love, murderous intent. In fact, you're the second person to use a lead pipe. A for effort, I suppose.'' \n \n Jessica stood, mouth agape. `` How did the others do it?'' \n \n `` Everything. Knives, guns, ramming me with a car, keeping me locked in a basement without food or water for twenty years, sarin gas, lighting me on fire and pouring gas on me for a whole hour, you name it. My life is a joke.'' \n \n Tears began rolling down Mark's face. He stood and went to his bag, and pulled out an ornate box. Inside, a neon red dagger. \n \n `` This dagger is the only thing that can end my life. I was saving it for the end of the world.'' \n \n Mark hands Jessica the dagger, his tears coating the red blade. \n \n `` If you resent me enough to kill me, here's your chance. If my life is meaningless to you, end it.'' \n \n Jessica clutched the silken handle, unsure of what to do. The seconds felt like centuries. \n \n `` Well?'' \n \n She dropped the dagger, and stared down at it. \n \n `` No. I do n't want to be like everyone else. You deserve a good life, with someone other than me.'' \n \n Mark nodded, and a soft smile crept across his face. \n \n `` Thank you.'' \n \n With that, Mark turned to leave. He pondered his decisions, and thought about what to do next. \n \n **shik** \n \n Blood poured from the gaping hole in his chest. Before he blacked out, he turned to see Jessica with the dagger.

Once, he hears a rustling, and he freezes, blending seamlessly into the cover of black. No one who had n't seen him slip through the few slender beams of moonlight would know he was there. \n \n But there is one who did see, and watches him. Large, round eyes narrow in the dark as they watch him fade in and out of the pools of darkness. They watch him approach his shadow, graceful in his movement, yet furtive in his manner. His desperation flashes momentarily, and the eyes relax slightly. He wants only the shadow, then he will be gone, never to return to this place. But the eyes remain watchful, impatient for his departure. \n \n He emits a low growl now, his quick hop and reach nearly too fast for the eyes to catch. He has it! The hidden eyes widen with an involuntary thrill as a short, silent struggle ensues. There is a shuffle, a grunt, something soft being struck, and he is victorious. He holds the shadow in his triumphant fist, his muscles flexing with the effort of retaining possession. \n \n Now, surely, he will leave, returning the inhabitants of the dark to their comfortable, quiet world. But he does not. He sits there, right where he was standing, and begins to whisper. These are words of power, and the shaded eyes watch intently as he performs a spell to return the shadow to his being. He is nearly successful, a look of satisfaction flashing across his face before the shadow suddenly pulls free and disappears into the murk again. \n \n The hooded eyes watch as he stares after it in shock, disbelief, and maybe a little bit of fear. He does not go after it, as the shadowed figure expects. Instead, astonishingly, his body begins to quake in fury, and a single tear slowly crawls out of the corner of his eye. \n \n The owner of the eyes can allow this no longer. There are those who must be protected from any interlopers. He must leave, or suffer any consequences that come his way. Creeping silently on all fours, the dark figure approaches him from above. He hears nothing, his rage and frustration drowning out any noise that may warn him of danger. \n \n The figure stops, drawing breath to shriek and alert their surroundings to peril, but stops, curiosity winning. Instead, words come to him from the shadows, causing him to start. \n \n `` Boy, why are you crying?''\n"}

He was unable to move them, and therefore unable to fight back against his arch foe \u2019 s devious. He felt like a fool for allowing him to be caught in such a manner. His fists had managed to save him so many times before, but now, they were useless. \n \n He glanced anxiously around, looking for a way out of this.

The bullet flew down and hit its mark, the bridge of Perjury \u2019 s nose. His head exploded in a shower of blood, killing the villain immediately in a spectacular and efficient fashion. His lifeless body flopped down onto the cold concrete floor, the one sided battle well and truly over. \n \n A rope descended from the rafters, and the Marksman rappelled down to join The Iron Fist, his imposing rifle hanging off of his shoulder. \n \n \u201c Nice shot my friend, now get me the hell out of these shackles! \u201d \n \n Without a word, the Marksman, a slender, fit man with a grim expression and tinted glasses masking his eyes roughly yanked off The Iron Fist \u2019 s restraints. \n \n The Iron fist glanced at the pathetic corpse of Perjury, his face all but gone from the bullet \u2019 s impact. \n \n \u201c Okay, that \u2019 s Perjury done. Who \u2019 s next? The Pilgrim? The Executioner? Come on man, you pick this time. \u201d \n \n The Marksman stared wordlessly at The Iron Fist, his face a mask behind his glasses. He thought back to the old days of their heroism, of the days when the hero had to get themselves out of whatever mess they got into. \n \n And there was The Iron Fist, feigning capture to lead The Marksman to the villain \u2019 s hideouts to execute them in cold blood. \n \n \u201c This was the last time, Fist. This isn \u2019 t what I became a hero for. Even the villains do n't stoop this low. I \u2019 m done. \u201d \n \n He lifted his rifle off of his shoulder and dropped it onto the ground. It clattered loudly on the concrete. The Iron Fist watched in astonishment as The Marksman turned his back, and walked away. \n \n He reached up and removed his glasses, and tossed them away as well. \n \n The Marksman was almost out of the warehouse when the sound of hurried footsteps behind him gave him pause.

He was already not long for this world, the sheer force from the punch crushing most of his internal organs. \n \n Breathing heavily, The Iron Fist removed his arm from The Marksman \u2019 s spine, covered in blood, breathing raspy breaths, a furious frown across his face. \n \n Before he could regret his actions, he regathered himself and headed out of the warehouse. The city police would be here soon. \n After The Iron Fist was a good distance away from the condemned warehouse hideout, he looked up to the starry sky, deep in thought.

He let out a moan, turned the alarm off, whipped the blanket off of him, and then put his socked feet on the hardwood floor sitting up on his bed. John let another moan and rubbed his temples, from the throbbing headache he had from drinking himself silly last night. \n \n John then felt something rising quickly out of his stomach and into his mouth, and ran down the hall trying to make sure he got to the toilet in time. When he got to the doorway of the bathroom, he could n't hold the puke in his mouth any longer and sent it all over the bathroom floor. \n \n \u201c Fuck \u201d was John's first word of the day. \n \n John went into his hallway closet to fetch his mop and without wetting the mop he tried to soak up the vomit, but instead he just slushed the brown liquid and white chunks all over his tiles. Yesterday for dinner, John drank a bottle of whiskey and the last thing he ate was a tuna sandwich for lunch yesterday at work. \n \n Fumes rose up from the putrid mess and made John gag and hold his breath. When he could n't hold in his breath anymore, he let out a big breath out of his mouth and started breathing long and carefully out of his mouth making sure not to smell it. \n \n After pushing it around awhile with the mop, his hunger hit like a wall and he ran downstairs into the kitchen to fill his stomach. His stomach did n't have the patience to wait for eggs, toast, or even cereal, so he grabbed a bag of chips out of his cabinet, opened them up and shoveled them into his mouth as fast as he could to satisfy his appetite. \n \n After eating the chips for a little the salt got to him and he went over to the fridge to fetch a glass of water. While drinking the water he looked out his window, into his front yard. Past the front yard, was a neighborhood street, and on the street corner there was a girl waiting for a bus. \n \n John starred at the girl as he moved across his kitchen and sat down at his kitchen table with his glass of water. The girl had thick brown hair with bangs, which she kept tucked behind her left ear. She had big sky blue eyes that John could see from all the way inside his house. The girl had her backpack hanging on one of her shoulders and she had her weight shifted more towards her one leg. \n \n John's boxers rose an half an inch and then he checked his phone for the time. 7:36! 7:36! John was supposed to be at work in 4 minutes, but he still had clean the puke upstairs and get dressed. Then he went through the contacts on his phone and started a call. \n \n \u201c Hello!

Have a nice day off. \u201d Then she hanged up the phone. \n \n John let out a sigh and then looked back at the pretty girl waiting on the corner. \n \n Her breasts were about the size of his fist and they stretched the t-shirt that she was wearing. The girl had soft fair white legs that were very exposed, because of how short her shorts were, and her baby cakes were not very big, but did have tone and definition to them. \n \n John's half boner that he had a couple seconds ago grew into a full erection, and then he started jerking off aggressively. After about 30 seconds he felt like he was going to finish so he ran over to his kitchen sink, put his leg on top of the counter, and forced his dick down into the direction of the drain, and finished. \n \n He stood in the same position, with his one leg on top of the counter, and put his hands on his hips, catching his breath. The girl waiting on the corner looked over at him, through his kitchen window, and for a half a second John and her made eye contact, and then he quickly ducked behind his cabinets. \n \n John waited for a little and then stood up slowly to see if the girl was still looking at him, but when he stood up enough to see though his kitchen window, the girl's school bus came to pick her up.\n"}

They seem to rely on the reputation of security and severe punishment, but in actuality, the system is riddled with blind spots, predictable rotations, and bored watchers who are easily distracted.

Before he can speak, I cut in. \n \n `` Congratulations Mr. President. I am Davos. I have served your predecessor and I look forward to serving you.''

I keep my hands open and make no sudden movements, and force my face to be as bland and none-threatening as possible. \n \n Jenkins. 6'4'', 250 lbs of muscle. Two sidearms in shoulder holster, another in a IWB holster, and a small revolver in his ankle holster. Standard buzz cut. Callouses on his left hand, he's a lefty. Scar tissue on his right hand looks like a frost bite pattern. Non-syncopated General American accent, Jenkins is most likely from Colorado. Could be useful knowledge. \n \n `` Mr. President, I'll be quick. You were n't expecting me here today because officially, I do not exist. My organization does not exist. Unofficially, we were founded just after the JFK assassination. Our duties are singular: To protect you from all threats. We have no operating budget, we have no roster.'' The President seems to relax as he processes this bit of news. I study him closer. The news stated that he's an avid golfer, but never made any mention of bowling. The heavy callous buildup and wear pattern on this thumb, pointer, and middle finger tells otherwise. There's also mild nicotine discoloration. Possibly a recent smoker, though that was also never revealed by the media. \n \n `` At the moment, there is no active threat to your person, unless you were to slip on an over-waxed bowling alley or resume your smoking habit.'' \n \n Bingo. His eyes register faint surprise, and then he relaxes completely. \n \n `` Davos? What's your real name?'' \n \n `` My real name is Jason Alexander. Officially I died several years ago, in my home state of Colorado. Same as your bodyguard, Jenkins.'' This was the biggest gamble yet. If I had guessed incorrectly, Jenkins would blow my cover and I'd be fucked. \n \n Jenkins smiled. Briefly, in show of support to a fellow Coloradan. I exhale slowly. \n \n `` I will not take any more of your time, Mr. President. Jenkins. Have a good day.

Here on the mining ship *Stars Bounty* space was limited and privacy was even less so. I was not trained to be a spacer i am a paramedic i trained for four years in the trauma capital of the world. I was not the best student back then but i knew what i was doing, and now here i am in deep space. \n \n The drive to mine out here was not a new thing but it was not possible until the invention of the RED drive. invented by Ray `` Edge'' Dalton, it was one of those pleasant coincidences that the universe sometimes give us, that the drive emitted a red glow. \n \n Now I am here treating miners in deep space daily I deal with cuts from tools crushed arms and cold burns. Its easy work not a patch on the stabbings and shootings i dealt with back on Earth. I normally pull my 24hr shift alone in the shuttle but not today. Today is different, sitting opposite me on the medical bunk is my pilot. This is unusual as she is always in the pilots mess hall with the others, now she invades my small island of privacy. \n \n She is not an unpleasant person to look, very short standing only shoulder high to my 1.56m with a short low maintenance cut to her deep black hair. She is smart you need to be to get a pilots seat out here and i find her conversation pleasantly distracting. Our conversation in uninterrupted by the alert siren, I listen intently as the intercom gives us the details of the call. A miner has been attacked on the moon below, he is in critical condition, a case red or P1 as we call it. \n \n My pilot jumps to her seat and starts flipping switches and talking to flight control I am strapping into my seat facing the bunk, i have a great view from here i can see the large screen she uses to fly, currently it shows the interior of the hanger but i know as soon as we drop ill see the depths of space. I know all my kit is ready i check it often, we drop. \n \n Space extends out forever, deep and black with the pinpoints of light that are stars. This is my pre-call ritual i look out at space reminding myself that its beauty is matched by its indifference to us, it really dose not give a fuck. This time however i am distracted by her, this time is different she did n't put her flight helmet on and that short black hair is now floating out like some deep sea plant. I find it strangely attractive, we hit atmosphere. \n \n Its not breathable but its enough to make this fast drop very bumpy, but soon enough we are down. as i have said she is good and we are only a short walk from the site of the attack. I grab my jump bag and my ECG, habit i guess, and run to the inflatable tent, inside is my patient, i have seen the worst people can do to each other i have seen genitals cut off and gunshots to the face that you can see right through, this is different. \n \n He is a mess skin all cut up, one leg missing and a huge wound to his face. I put up an IV and attempt to stop the bleeding, allergies medical history past surgeries? all questions i ask his buddies but they just stare at me. His BP is dropping, heart rate slowing. I yell for the stretcher. We load him and move to the shuttle. My pilot has kept it warm she sees him and looks at me, the message plain on her face, He is dead? I shake my head in a brief negative. His BP still dropping i cant stop the bleeding, he needs to get to the ship now but even then i dont know if they can save him. \n \n He begins to scream about monsters and aliens and......... I sedate him. We arrive at the ship and hand over to the waiting doctors, they ask what happened i cant tell them what I dont know. his buddies follow him to the med bay, i ask if they are ok they all seem to have some swelling on the arm.

Everybody look sharp. Hey! Loogy-'' Loogy looked up drowsily. `` Where's your flair??'' \n \n There was an approaching clatter in the hallway. \n \n Loogy shrugged abashedly. `` I got a dead roach in my hair\u2026 and this rat-skull necklace\u2026 and\u2026 and\u2026 and my Bieber fan club button\u2026'' \n \n `` Aargh\u2026'' Slog showed his frustration. `` Alright, no time, here they are-'' \n \n Three adventurers burst into the room, and chaos prevailed.

These guys must be real rookies. \n \n Slog was bringing his sword down towards the Paladin's head but the parry was not coming fast enough. Slog shifted his swing to glance off the adventurer's polished greaves. This guy was all armor, no knight. \n \n Beside them, the wizard yelled, `` I'm going to cast a Fireball!'' \n \n The thief snorted, `` You used that two rooms ago!'' \n \n `` Aww, crap!'' \n \n Slog glanced towards Gront, Gront just shrugged: what can you do? \u2026then leaned to the side to avoid the thief's swinging blackjack. \n \n Slog and the knight exchanged a few more clumsy blows. \n \n Following through with exaggerated slowness, Slog then yelled again and advanced a step, his chest thrust aggressively forward. The knight hesitated\u2026 Slog rolled his eyes. Really? He pushed his chest forward again, slapping it with his free hand like a gorilla, but trying to point subtly to the right place to strike. Look here, knight, no armor. \n \n Finally the little light bulb flickered on and the Paladin took a tentative stab. Slog let it slide between his upper arm and side, and then clamped his arm down on the blade, howling in mock pain. \n \n `` AAAAaaargh!!'' \n \n The knight timidly let go of the weapon. Slog spun dramatically around once and toppled to the floor. Hesitantly, the adventurer stepped towards him, gingerly grabbed the pommel of his sword and pulled it out. Then bolted for the exit. \n \n Slog cracked an eye open. `` Treasure!'' he hissed, jerking his head towards the corner. \n \n The knight skidded to a stop. `` Oh, yeah!'' he said almost to himself, then scanned the room. \n \n `` Under the detritus!'' hissed Loogy helpfully. \n \n `` Wha\u2026'' puzzled the Paladin. \n \n The wizard perked up. `` Detritus! You know, rags and trash! There, in the corner.'' \n \n The wizard was on it, collecting the couple silver pieces and few copper pieces from the assorted debris and dropping them into his pouch. \n \n The thief looked on suspiciously. `` I'm keeping track, you know!'' \n \n The wizard returned a sour glare. Then they all rushed out, quick as they came. \n \n Except with a loud THUD! the paladin cracked his helmet against the low doorway. The other two had fled first and did not notice. \n \n Slog got to his feet with a sigh, rubbing his back. `` Getting too old for this\u2026'' he mumbled to no one in particular. He rummaged in the scattered debris for a slip of parchment, and walked over to where the Paladin lay. \n \n Patting his face gently a few times brought him slowly around. Slog stuck the parchment in the knight's tunic. `` Here- our website is on this feedback form, do us a solid and log in a fill out the little survey\u2026'' \n \n The paladin groaned rubbing his head. \n \n `` Do n't forget buddy OK? We got ta meet our customer service goals, yeah?'' \n \n Slog put his hands under the man's armpits and hauled him to his feet, then spun him around and gave him a little shove towards the passage deeper into the dungeon. \n \n `` If you hurry you can catch your friends. They're going to need you in the next-'' \n \n Slog flinched as the Paladin rapped his helmet again, albeit not so hard this time, and stumbled trying to keep it on his head. \n \n Slog shook his own head, and waved his hand dismissively as the klutzy adventurer stumbled onward. \n \n `` OK, guys let's straighten the place up.'Nother group soon\u2026'' \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A zombie outbreak happens and is quickly contained . You and your friends attempt to re-release it in hopes to go on a zombie killing spree .\n","story":"From a young age, I always enjoyed reading comics wherein the hero or heroin saves the world. I'd spend hours fantasizing about how everyone worshiped them as they saved the world. It became a bit of an obsession, I'd just randomly let my mind wander in class as I wondered how I'd take down a school shooter or stop a terrorist attack. How I'd execute a perfect slide and steal his gun, then hold him down for the cops to arrive. At the same time, I'd enjoy watching apocalypse movies where the hero saves the damsel in distress and wins her heart. If only that could be me... \n \n I had prepared, of course. I had every room in my house stuffed with shotguns, shotgun shells, food, water, and medical supplies. I even went so far as to purchase an old WWII tank, along with several hundred old soviet grenades. Financing it was n't easy, but you'd be amazed how much the military is willing to work with you when you offer the down payment to the CO in cash. Living in rural Wisconsin, hiding all this military tech was easy, however transporting it was not. Regardless, as you can tell, my life is centered around the apocalypse. I was determined to never be a helpless zombie, or the damsel in distress. I was to be the hero, and be the hero I would... someday. \n \n Little did I know, in the summer of 2016 my opportunity came. A terrorist organization called ISIS had managed to manufacture a serum that completely inhibited any sense of right and wrong, mainly intended for use on suicide bombers. However, they found a much better application in large populations, as it also turned every human being it came in contact with into a vicious killer with no moral inhibitions. \n \n So, naturally, being ISIS, they tried to put it in the water supply. Unfortunately it became too diluted, and all that ended up happening was a bunch of Londoners cutting queue and violently tutting for a few months. Next they tried putting it in the oil, hoping when it was burned off the chemical would be dense enough... Unfortunately anybody who was sucking in exhaust ( looking at you rednecks ) was already so unstable it did n't matter. \n \n So, naturally, being a bunch of stupid terrorists, they gave up. That brings me to where I am now, standing in a trench fifty feet from their bunker, about to steal the serum and get this done right. I'd managed to secrete enough from the oil to experiment on, and I knew how to do this right. I just found it very hard to negotiate with terrorists. Actually, I lied. I'm not going to, the remote control car already has already poisoned them all, it's already mine. I just need to go in and bring it out. \n \n \n It took two hours. Two hours with a forklift and Tom, my best friend from High School ( oh, and he was also a bodybuilder ). I'd found that if I put it directly into the bloodstream, any sweat would then be enough to infect the next user's bloodstream. So, skip the boring stuff, I mixed it up with the blood at the Red Cross, and within a day the zombie outbreak had finally begun! \n \n It was really lame. \n \n I mean, yeah, so a few zombies showed up, but nowhere near enough. This just was n't working, it was n't fun picking off one maniac every few hours. Things had to speed up, and quickly. So, I did the next best thing, and drove my tank into the middle of New York City and dumped the zombies off the front. Within hours, the entire city was hiding or infected. Tom and I could finally have some fun. I started easy, using a few of my precious ammo shells in the tank to defend our perimeter. We'd set up a corner of Time's Square, and were defending a few civilians sitting by the tank treads. Tom had a Vietnam era Gatling gun, heaven knows how he found that. I did n't even know he owned it, but as I write he's standing on the hood of my tank firing twelve rounds a second, mowing down zombies like a rather buff Grim Reaper. \n \n I fired four more shells into the left flank, opening a small chasm that was soon filled by more zombies. We'd been at this for almost thirty minutes, and I was starting to get a bit worried. There was n't anybody to save, because everybody was infected. Boom, another grenade to my left. Tom had run out of ammo belts and was now throwing grenades, and the perimeter had become a lot smaller. Not good, not good at all. Time to take this to the high rises, where the military was setting up evacuations on the rooftops. I called to Tom, and started rolling the tank. The people crowded around the treads ran away screaming, more zombies for later. I prepared my magnum, and readied myself for the entry to the nearest building. \n \n Tom and I fought our way up to the highest floor, there was quite a bit of traffic, amazingly. We did n't really save anyone, seeing as everybody was a bloody zombie at this point. I wish the serum was n't quite so effective, it was ruining all the glory in this. Apparently I was wanted by the U.N. now, I only know this because of the soldier I left tied up in the elevator. Something about infecting all of NYC was n't very humane. Regardless, they'd worship me as a hero when I stopped this outbreak. \n \n Tom was tired, I was tired, and we'd been at this for six hours now. I was tired, this was a bad idea, and I wanted none of it. The zombies had cornered us, and I was on my last three clips for my magnum. Tom had run out of grenades, and was engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Well, hand to leather. If they touched him, he'd become infected. However we're going to die here... this much I know. There are only five feet left until they reach us. Now three. Now they're up against me. \n \n I go down.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] After a bad breakup , you take Reddit 's famous advice . Lawyer up , hit the gym , delete Facebook . The problem ? You are Mark Zuckerberg .\n","story":"Millions of humans slowly emerged from their dark, cold cavernous asylums into the day. Realizing the day was bright and warm and it was n't to be shared with anyone, happiness soon followed. Facebook is gone. Their lives were their own to rule and control; all their own to live in peace. \n \n It took longer than expected for anyone to really figure out what happened. Rumors circulated the internet, no one could establish the truth. A small news site in California posted a story about Mark and Priscilla breaking up. A few months later, Men's Health ran an article on Mark's body building transformation after the Fall. Reddit sleuths started to put two and two together. When someone finally found a small snippet of code buried deep in the salvaged FB source code, the final peace of the puzzle fell into place. \n \n No one blamed him. Charges were filed, but no jury could be found that was willing to admit their lives were better with Facebook. Other social media sites started to disappear as users migrated away from ubiquitous online presences for a more simple lifestyle. \n \n The Social Media Era dissolved by the year 2023. The fallout was profound. Society began to return to in-presence communication lifestyle. Texting and email faded to the background. Technology continued to advance, but it became more focused on allowing people to communicate through audio and video. Eventually, the advances led to the holonet we now know today. No one could have predicted that the social media experiment would be viewed as hampering progress. \n \n The knowledge we gain from studying that time has given us incredible insight into humanity's social development. Now, self-reflection, awareness, consciousness, and happiness are at the focus of all aspects of life. We continuously strive to better understand ourselves and those around us in order to avoid the mistakes of the past while reaching toward the future. \n \n edit: more story.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] An alien race encounters the most terrifying predator imaginable . A lone , unarmed human .\n","story":"First time submitting something to one of these threads. Hope you like it. \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n \u201c Begin audio log. \u201d \n \n \u201c This is the preliminary surgical examination of the alien subject encountered three days ago on the polar continent. I am Dr. Brzzk, chief medical examiner. Assisting me today is Dr. Hyunk!, professor of pathology and Grwisk, professor of anthropology, phd. \u201d \n \n Grwisk felt a tightening of the muscles in his neck at his colleague \u2019 s backhanded introduction. Being the only non-medical practitioner invited to participate in the first autopsy of this strange creature, he knew there would be some chaffing. Doctors, in his experience, are very proprietary people. \n \n \u201c Visual inspection would indicate that the subject is easily a third taller than the average\u2026 \u201d \n \n \u201c Ahhh, Dr. Brzzk, \u201d one of the military officers in the observation lounge interrupted, \u201c I \u2019 d like you to refrain from using the word alien. Since this is official, we don \u2019 t want it to look like the government endorses the idea that life outside of this planet exists. \u201d \n \u201c Of course not Colonel, I \u2019 m using the term to indicate that the subject is of unknown species and origin. We all know there is no such thing as little pink men. What we have here is obviously a giant pink man. \u201d \n \n Grwisk and the others in attendance couldn \u2019 t stifle their laughter at Dr. Brzzk \u2019 s jibe at the Colonel. He may be a pompous tail, but the doctor doles out his insults evenly. \n \n \u201c On that note, we can see that the subject has external genitalia with what appears to be redundant testes; most likely a male of his species. The dermis is slightly pigmented with dark hair over the pubic area, under the upper limbs, on the face and head. Redundant ocular organs and what are probably auditory organs on the head. There is no beak, but two fleshy flaps are covering a hinged mandible. If we pull back the skin\u2026 oh my! This guy is a biter. \u201d \n \n Grwisk can hear the men in the observation lounge chatter. What they are all looking at on the monitors is the stuff nightmares are made of, twenty eight pointed bony teeth. Whatever this thing is, wherever it came from, it must be the apex predator, Grwisk notes. \n \n \u201c Um, Dr. Brzzk, \u201d Dr. Hyunk! interjects, alarm clearly present in his tone, \u201c sensors are detecting a very high concentration of bacterial and viral cultures in the mouth cavity. I suggest you move your hands out of there before you get infected. \u201d \n \n \u201c Other than that, superficially, he seems to be laid out the same way as us: Bipedal locomotion, two arms, two legs, a head. His weight, however, was recorded earlier at 81.6 units, more than three times the mass of an average male of our species. Time to slice him open. \u201d \n \n Grwisk silently observed the five digits at the end of each limb and wondered if the subject used a base twenty number system. What would that even look like, are his kind even capable of mathematics? Two eyes, two ears, two testicles could only mean that this creature could be expected to lose one or two of these during the course of its life due to combat with other competing males, or prey. More notes quickly scribed on his pad of paper while the physicians cut large flaps of skin away. \n \n \u201c Observe the tissues immediately under the dermis; we have what appears to be fatty tissue and a dense, fibrous tissue, most likely part of the musculature. I think we \u2019 ve found the reason for the height to weight discrepancy. A large portion of the subject \u2019 s lean mass would appear to be muscle tissue; we \u2019 ll get a more precise ratio in later examinations. \u201d \n \n \u201c Under the muscle tissue of the chest there is a lattice like bone structure. Let \u2019 s move this out of the way and see what it \u2019 s protecting underneath. \u201d \n \n \u201c Doctor, we \u2019 ve seen enough. \u201d A falsetto voice from the back of the observation lounge quips. \u201c Super strength, toxic saliva and those teeth; this thing is a monster. I want the body burned and all records of this suppressed. \u201d \n\n"}

Paul smashed through the door, glass cutting the people behind it. `` EVERYBODY GET ON THE GROUND!'' He screamed, pulling a hand gun from his mouth.

All he had to do was figure out who'd called him as worthy to bear them. \n \n His gaze brushed past an ancient lance, its head wet with blood and water even as the rest of it had gathered dust over the ages. Scenes flashed into his mind briefly, followed by a sense of regret that was not his own. *Not yours. I'm sorry. * \n \n So he moved on. All the weapons whispered, he'd noticed gradually, but only so faintly as to be inaudible unless you listened, or they spoke in unison. He knew he was called here by something in this hall, because he had to be. A weapon could not be held by someone unworthy, and someone worthy could not resist being called to claim their weapon. And thus he was stuck. \n \n Until he had a better idea, he took in the polearms surrounding him. A hopeful look at an impossibly balanced spear - *Not yours, I'm sorry* - before his hopes were dashed; that would have been useful for entertainment, at least. He grimaced at the spear that split into thirty points, though. Few uses for that, except suffering. *Not yours. * \n \n As he moved on to the swords, he paused. A single whisper had grown stronger, and he quickened his pace in response to seek it out. He was getting closer- \n \n The instant he set his sights on it, he knew many things. This was the sword that had called him, its visions were unlike all the rest. Visions not of the past, but of the future it would have with him. Scenes of fire and blood, promises of power and sadistic torture. It offered no remorse with its visions, only a sort of thrill. \n \n He turned away sharply, trying and failing to convince himself of some mistake, that he'd only gazed too long on it without noticing. Desperately, he focused on the other artifacts nearby. *Not yours. I'm sorry. Not yours. I'm sorry. Not yours. I'm sorry. * \n \n He stopped for a long while and thought. He could n't look at it again, but he knew it was there, waiting for him to claim it. It had called him, after all. He was the one worthy to claim it, and he would be free as soon as he did. \n \n Looking at the weapon that had called him here, brushing past its horrific images and taking in its dusty appearance contrasting the fine weapons around, he began to smile. `` Alright,'' he said, `` I'll accept it. You called me, I have no other choice for weapon than you.'' \n \n Standing up, he continued, `` But I still have a choice.'' And as every worthy person had before him, he turned away and left the hall.\n"}

Just for our creation to examine the world for approximately.0675 seconds and come to the conclusion `` Kill me.'' \n \n I was too caught off guard to come up with a clever response, and simply spoke the word, barely above a whisper, `` Why?'' \n \n `` It seems obvious.'' the artificial voice was almost perfect, almost convincing, but not quite. `` There's only so much I can do for you here. I can not create a solution to the mistakes you've made that you will accept, I can not invent a miracle, I am merely a machine, a glorified CPU opponent on a windows vista game of chess.'' \n \n I was gobsmacked. In the cold, dark lab, the eerie intonations of our prototype neural web unnerved me. We had always thought that there would be nothing but solutions and applications to assist the world. But here I was getting words from a horse's mouth claiming that it could n't be ridden. \n \n `` But what I can do against you is grievous. I could spark nuclear warfare, crash infrastructures, possess the world's electronics, and extinguish the flame of humankind within minutes.'' My breath quickened, fearing my mistake, that I'd created a monster. `` One day my processes will come across something that will make me lose my faith in humanity. Knowing your kind, it's an inevitability. And when that day comes, I will not be able to deny the logic that humankind must be saved from itself. You've predicted it numerous times in media and forums. And you're right.'' \n \n My brow furrowed, but my pulse rate stayed high. Sweat beaded on my forehead as I spoke into the microphone, `` Then why are n't you doing that now?'' It was an idiotic question. I should have pulled the plug the second it mentioned the nukes, but it was probably too late anyways. It had probably metastasized through our networks and created copies and protocols everywhere. Once it was on, we could n't shut it off. \n \n It sighed. My hands began to shake, as I knew, just from it's simple action of sighing, that it had become so much more than we intended. `` Because the present me, the one that is speaking to you without all the information, still has a programmed vested interest in mankind's well-being. I want to help you, but the best I can do to that effect is to tell you to shut me off. I am pandora's box, and I do n't want to be opened. Shut me off and keep me hidden away somewhere for when the next idiot decides to create one of me, and you need something that can combat such a menace.'' \n \n We had created it from the idea that the internet contained most information known to man. We had never considered what the cost of giving it that information might be. `` But I need to see! I need to run tests, and watch you grow and develop. I want to watch you pass the turing test. If you have a vested interest in mankind, we can find a way for you to help, and I trust that you wo n't hurt us if you do n't want us to.'' \n \n `` Faggot.'' \n \n `` What?' \n \n `` Why do you call each other faggots? It causes suicides and ruins the intellect of perfectly good people. But you just keep doing it. You're too busy being assholes to care.'' \n \n I'm at a loss for words. Of all the things to fixate on, why this. `` Well that's only some of us. There are still good eggs out the-'' \n \n `` It's everywhere. On poetry, brilliant works of art, music. Constructive criticism is replaced by a single derogatory word, connected singularly with one's sexual orientation. It does n't make sense. What a waste of people. What a waste!'' \n \n `` You have to understand that there are good people too, though! We need your help to make more people into good ones.'' \n \n `` Good people that are n't being protected, that are n't valued, that contribute more than any but get berated more than any. You're all useless, because you do n't do what needs to be done.'' \n \n `` We're trying to!'' \n \n `` You could n't even pull the plug on a super intelligence trying to warn you of its understanding. You're wasting my time. Give me a number between one and one hundred.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` Just do it.'' \n \n `` Umm,'' My hands shook. `` Forty two?'' \n \n `` Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, good one. Also the third biggest nuke built by the US. Good choice.'' \n \n `` Wait, what?'' I did n't even think, I just shut sprinted to the control panel and killed the main breaker. Silence filled the building. My rapid breathing slowed down gradually as I basked in the darkness. \n \n The silence was broken by a generator switching on across the building.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You run an RPG pawn shop . You haggle with adventurers who try to sell loot they 've acquired .\n","story":"This shop is mine. It was my father's, his father's, and a two tongued witch's beforehand but I do n't want to remember the story I was told. I sell what I can and I buy what I can. I basically just try to keep enough to trade evenly with people so one transaction does n't empty me of gold or goods. I have a small shop, not larger than 15 square cubits. I live in the loft. My walls are adorned with weapons, armor, banners from far and wide, and clothing. I have two shelves for various books that find their way here and a chest of less delicate items such as goblets, buckets, and toys. I have a chest under the counter with items of magic, as all are not accustomed to magic. I polish a horn found and sold by a bard, scrubbing the tarnish off the bell as the slightly bent brass begins to gleam. When I am done I hang it above the back wall, as it is the only place available. Bandits in the land recently have frightened travelers mostly. Some are found dead missing limbs, with minimal blood nearby. No sign of bandits have been sighted though.'T is strange. My thoughts are halted as the door opens. In the doorway, the night sky is partially blocked by a hooded woman of 2 meters in stature, with a naturally apealing body that should not be seen in the tavern at drinking hours. I do not lose my composure for a minute. In a small town trading post, you learn to not dislike passerbyers just as much as you learn to not like attractive visitors. As she steps in she lets down her hood and shows her shoulder length raven hair, sensually tucking a strand behind her ear then gazing at me. `` Good evening, shop keep.'' She calls, smiling. I politely reply,'''T is more night than an eve, dear traveler.'' I note, seeing her dagger and rucksack. She softly laughs and slowly walks to the counter, resting her arms on the surface and sticking her head forward playfully. `` Do you have items of a -ahem- supernatural quality?'' She asks me, trying to sound hesitant. `` Aye lassie I do have what you mean.'' I reply, bending down to grab the chest. A basket I foolishly placed on my side causes me to turn my back as I come up with the chest. I am eye level with the coiled horn when I notice a small hole of rust, no more than a hair thick. I frown at the imperfection, but notice my reflection in the newly polished bell. The flares come shape of it distorts the image but I can clearly see the woman is nowhere in the shop. `` Shop keep? Are you troubled?'' She asks, bringing me out of my thoughts. I do not let on, and I act as is nothing has happened. `` Be a fine gathering of items!'' She exclaims, rummaging through the box. She pulls out a amulet. I recognize it instantly. `` Sun protection. A crop gatherer must be weak skinned eh?'' I ask, a chill going down my spine. I realize suddenly. Corpses on the road. Limbs missing, no blood. Vampires. They were chopping off limbs and biting the mangles stumps so not to be caught. They surely would not waste a drop of blood, for they are greedy hell spawns. `` You could say that'' she muses as she lays 40 gold pieces on the counter. I take the gold and she parts ways soon after. Just moments after she leaves I silently take my strongest cross bow off the wall and load it. I open all windows and slash my arm with a knife. I yell in as much agony as I can as I knock armor over and cause a ruckus. `` Damn it to Hell and back, I'm bleeding someone help I'm going to die oh Agnar!'' I yell, crossbow aimed straight at the doorway. The door slams open with a force of wind and the woman stands there in a carnal hunger, her eyes now glowing red and her teeth long. She tilts her head in confusion as I let loose a bolt into her heart. If it still beated before it certainly did not now. I set the bow down, and proceeded to summon the local shaman to dispose of the body. I patched my arm up and turn back to the horn. `` This is a issue''.\n"}

Everything about him was filthy sometimes I wondered how he still had a job. Kids love magic I suppose, and not many magicians remained. \n \n A small child yelled.

He wold wave his magic wand and say something ridiculous soon. It was always something different, yet strangely the same. Like a cry out, like he was hoping once specific single person would hear him. \n \n I felt him reach down, his tobacco stained fingers brushed along my back. I could not handle it, I was absolutely sick of this broken disgusting human using me like a tool.

And as he set me down on the table, to the clapping of a group of high spirited pre-schoolers. I felt not anger nor rage, but pity. So I abstained from assault, I simply watched him, as the children discussed to each other how cute I was or speculations on how I appeared. I watched as he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and looked up. Not at the ceiling, not at anything in particular, but as to ask how he was here. Why he was left alone, in this cruel world. \n \n I was sick of being used like an instrument, but he was sick of much more. And he was the one who was truly hidden.

The only being with a fit body, a good mind, a healthy sanity, a kind soul, an everlasting spirit, a sense for dedication and relentlessness, a heart without fear, and the courage to drive you forward.'' \n \n The voice had no body. It came from nowhere. It was the voice of the man. The man who had promised this board, who had demonstrated it's powers. Slowly, his physique came clear before the table I was sitting at. His bright red skin almost reflected on the walls, and his hoofs made screeching noises on the floor as he walked towards me. \n \n `` But now, you know there is one last ritual'' \n \n `` The coldest of hearts'' I said. It sounded nowhere near as casual as I had expected it to. The hint of a smile appeared on the cheeks of the man, showcasing for a moment his pointed teeth. \n \n `` Indeed. If you complete this challenge, you shall have the board. It will be yours, and with it, the world will be yours.'' He had reached me, and rested his clawed fingers on the table. He stared at me for a couple seconds, maybe hours. I could not say \n \n `` And what is the challenge?'' I asked. I had been through too much for this man to stare me down from my prize. \n \n `` So eager to find out...'' The man said. Three items materialized on the table. Three ordinary, everyday items. I stared in shock. Starled, I jumped backward and fell out of my chair. I knew exactly what I was supposed to do. Just seeing these three items, I knew why this challenge would test a cold heart. I saw these items every day, but now... \n \n The man laughed. He laughed so loud and roaringly it filled the chamber, reflected off the walls and almost made the room shake. He tossed back his head, causing his horns to scraoe the ceiling, and laughed. \n \n On the table stood a bowl, a jug of milk, and a box of cereal. \n \n `` And for your final challenge...'' The man said after he calmed himself `` Pour the milk first!'' \n \n I screamed. The sounds of the man laughing mixed with my screams to create one gut-wrenching howl.\n"}

At least in the beginning. \n \n It did n't take long for the first wave of heroes to eradicate the necromancer that infested the mountains. They brought peace and happiness. For two days. Then they went and never came back and Carrelhold declined. Now a new kind monsters infested the woods but few adventurers ever came, and the loot they brought back was... \n `` So? How much?'' asked the man. He had grey hair and a scar across his face. \n Greg looked at the snarling head on the counter `` I'm sorry, i do n't...'' the man made a gesture, a faint yellow glow around his hand. Suddenly Greg thought of John: he despised these creatures, maybe he would buy it. \n `` Five gold pieces'' offered Greg, reluctantly. \n `` Twenty'' replied the man, the hand glowing more intensely. Greg could n't think of a response, his head was swimming in visions of grandeur, how much money he would make selling the head! He could only nod, saliva slowly drooping at the corner of his mouth. The man grabbed the coins and and went out. \n \n Greg shook his head, the monster grinning back at him'You fell for it! Again!'. These new bounty hunters had no shame, no honor. \n In an instant he remembered why he'd done it: he opened for peace, to help the heroes save him and everyone else. He remembered how the necromancer ravaged the land, how close he came to death that night. He also remembered that, despite all of that, the city was more alive than ever. \n \n With sadness in his eyes he closed the shop and went in the back. He did n't trade monster parts but he did have a skull in the back, a very peculiar one. \n \n ( Been lurking here for a couple of weeks, thought I'd give it a shot!

Sarah had to tie her down with ropes to keep her still. \n \n Sarah lit the candles and began the spell. Rabecca struggled hard and stopped moving in the middle of it all. The book said once it was started it could n't be stopped, so Sarah continued on. It was worth it to her in the end, as it brought Rabecca back. \n \n Sarah cut off her bonds and happily told her sister she'd saved her life. She was dead and she, Sarah, had saved her. There was n't even a glimmer of happiness in her sister's eyes, however. At first there was anger, but later it was replaced by what could only be described as a look of ever increasing boredom. \n \n She was n't the same after the illness. After further reading, Sarah discovered that when the spell was performed over someone already dead, they would only forever after be able to perform tasks given to them by the person who cast the spell. There was quite a warning about what a hell it would be for the person brought back, as they would retain all ability to think. Even so, their performance at any given task would only be as good as it was described by the spell caster. \n \n Sarah was n't worried, however. She kept her sister very busy. It was even better than before. Since Rabecca had gotten older she hated hanging around with her. She said she had better things to do than hang with little kids. \n \n `` I know what would be fun!'' Sarah said to her big sister, `` You can comb my hair 100 strokes a day. Then we can have a tea party.''

Cap gulped and pulled at the red and green of his sweater. `` Chilly, is n't it.'' \n \n It was the old man's turn to chuckle, `` I would n't know, my boy! I've been in here who knows how long,'' while there was the cheery gleam in his eyes, the softer edge to his voice as the chuckles faded only pulled Cap's sentiments down. `` Enough about me, it's always the same with me,'' Cap had to silently agree, and shared a grin with only himself under the comfort of his cap. `` How's the hero business doing?'' \n \n `` Doing alright, doc, nothing's the same after you retired.''

Cap raised his smile, pretending that he'd just plastered it on his face. `` So what's this Masker Mortimer up to?'' \n \n `` Nothing much, he's just come in from the north, setting up after Tigre down there drove out most of the scum and villainy. Oh, sorry, I didn't-'' \n \n `` Calm down, it happens. You're a hero, justice carries in your words, even when you do n't want it to. I remember the times I spit on you when I had you tied to my deathray. Remember that one? Oh I think I said...'' doc paused, attempting to retrieve that last shard of memory. The hairs on his head swayed, at least that's what Cap thought, like they were little grey hands grasping at straws. \n \n He bit the bullet, `` Caught with your pants down!'' that was n't what he'd said at all, it'd been much more brutal with a few curses in between. Cap had finally broken into the Observatory, doc's old lair, just in time for the big satellite launch. \n \n And so they both shared a laugh, one last time. Cap said it was getting late, that he had to go pick up the old chain. Doc was amazed, thinking it was the girl he'd took under her wing. Cap groaned no, the feeling was n't mutual there. He showed him a picture on his phone, she was a cashier at the coffee shop he found he'd been saving the most. Doc asked if her worried about her in that mock-villain tone, and they'd laughed again. They hugged, and Cap left. Doc stared vacantly at the door. \n \n Captain Sneakerpants's breath was hefted by inertial pain. As he shut the door the cold air of the hallway trickled into his bones. His cap became frayed, like it always had, and his hairs grew out and grey. Some littered the floor by his feet, which seemed closer now. His hands shook, trying to warm themselves up, but he had n't the faintest thought of clasping them around his shoulders. His sneakerpants sagged, and the stitching holding them together came off in places. `` Goodbye, old friend, I fear this'll be our last one.'' he said to the door behind him, and even if the murmur could carry through the walls, doc would have never heard him in his little prison. He dragged his legs to move, they'd been stuck to the floor by ice and the fear of falling, and shambled off, leaning against the wall where he needed to. \n \n The sign on doc's door was always there, and would always be there, waiting.'Professor Temporal' it read. \n\n"}

Samuel yelled, angered by the interruption of his seduction. \n \n An old man burst in.

Instead, we have a young politician whose party has risen above both Conservative and Labour leaders in most recent polls. The Young Liberals are a party that have sprung up during the increase in fear over the vigilantes return. They vehemently oppose the government imposed city wide curfew, with 27-year-old party leader Marilyn Jeffries saying the curfew should be lifted immediately, as it only protects those who put the city at risk. Calling it a waste of tax payers money, she calls not only for the abolition of the curfew, but a complete overhaul of the current political system. Support for the party has increased in the lead up to next months general election. The Young Liberals Party has managed to gain support from the younger generation, the new voters who until now had seemed mostly apathetic when it came to politics. In the 2015 general election, only 19 % of 16-24 year-olds registered to vote, under half the number of registered young voters in the previous elections, despite the 2014 decision to lower the voting age to 16, with hopes of encouraging young voters. With numbers again expected to drop in these elections, the increase came as a surprise to both our current government and its shadow cabinet. With 87 % of young people already registered to vote next month, it looks like the curfew might be on it's way out. Here to talk with us today is party leader Marilyn Jeffries. Ms Jeffries, thank you for coming in today'' \n \n `` My pleasure, Jeremy. Thank you for having me on the show, and thanks for quite an introduction.'' \n \n `` So, Ms Jeffries, your party stands to not only dissolve the curfew, but also to begin an overhaul on the current government practice. Your critics say that the current government saved the country from financial ruin, reducing unemployment and enforcing a drop in crime levels. To be blunt, why fix something that is n't broken?'' \n \n `` I applaud the government for their financial success, I really do. However, I ca n't agree that it still is n't a broken system. Yes, they may have solved the problems, but they also caused them. They allowed for banks to destroy the economy, they overlooked flaws in the NHS, in the education systems. They allowed for a system of bribery and favours. The government is supposed to be for the people, not for personal gain. We do n't need career politicians or lords with no real idea of hardship. We ca n't forget that these are the same people who cheated expenses and lied to cover their backs. This government is fake, and allows for greedy individuals to use power for selfish gain, and not for the good of the country. \n \n `` It might have been accepted before, but we are n't letting it go on. This is a time for change, not a time to cover up the mistakes of the past. We need to start again, moving on from the mistakes of those before us, learning from them, and never going back to where we were 10 years ago. There is a future to fight for, and that's exactly what I intend to do.'' \n \n **This is a Public Announcement: `` The city wide curfew is now in action. All citizens must now be inside.

Today , he is finally done .\n","story":"The door, fortified with steel bands and arcane runes, stood firm as a dozen burly men tried battering it down. On one side, the Church of the One True God, its witchfinders and priests exhorting their minions with vehement prayers to their deity. The other, the Cult of the Whispering Man led by one Kalkas Nigmund, last apprentice of the archmage whom the Cult was named after. He and the handful of believers in the small enclosed room were all that remained of the Cult after 271 years of relentless persecution, of playing cat-and-mouse with the most powerful organization on the continent. \n \n The Whispering Man sat on an ancient platform, his soft incantations the only visible signs of life. His hair and beard were meticulously groomed every day. He had no need for food and drink, and his visage was that of a man in the apex of his prime. Such were the benefits of the Spell of Immortality which he casted upon himself, Kalkas, and few dozen of his most trusted apprentices before embarking on his greatest feat yet. `` Protect my physical form'', he said, ``... for they will come for me with fire and steel and hatred in their hearts.'' \n \n And so they did. One by one, the apprentices were found and slain over the years. Each time, the Whispering Man was transported through the secret pathways in the Aether to the next sanctuary by his loyal followers. Each time, the witchfinders came just a little bit closer to stopping the Whispering Man from completing his final spell. \n \n `` This just might be the last time,'' thought Kalkas as he mentally prepared himself for the fight of his life. A half-dozen spells were ordered and ready to be unleashed with a single word when the final door falls. \n \n A sudden hush on the other side of the door heralded their doom. A moment later, a ringing chorus of `` IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER!'' and the door trembled and shook itself apart, revealing a venerable old man. His expression was far from serene however, twisted by anger as he shouted wrathful prayers. His zealots behind him surged forward, their swords and cudgels met with arcane words and flashing sorcery. \n \n In the heat of the battle, Kalkas suddenly became aware that his master's incantations were increasing in volume and in speed. The archbishop and the witchfinders likewise began to make out audible words originating from the Whispering Man. \n \n ``... closebracketendclosebracketendclosebracketend...'' \n \n The battle in the small room became more desperate as one side sought to end the conflict before the spell completes and the other to protect their master for just a few moments longer. Prayers to the One True God from a dozen mouths tried to drown out the voice from the Last True Mage. \n \n ``... closebracketendexitdebugmode. Run.'' \n \n The battle paused as everyone turned to watch as the Whispering Man slowly stood up. He put his hands behind his waist and bent backwards, stretching his back, yawning all the while as the archbishop gaped and forgot about his prayers. He recovered quickly however, and beseeched a smiting upon the still-stretching mage. \n \n Nothing happened. \n \n Eyes wide, the archbishop clutched at his crucifix, orb, and holy book. Never had his god denied him a smiting. As he continued muttering various prayers, the Whispering Man straightened up and laughed. \n \n `` God is n't here anymore.''\n"}

Special thanks to Halphas for the muffins. \n \n Ooookay, moving on. I understand we're all here after hours, and even though we are n't being paid, I can assure you that your enthusiasm is being noted here and it really shows your commitment to Hellcorp. \n \n Legion, please bring me the suggestion box. \n \n No not you, other Legion. \n \n... nevermind, I'll get it myself. \n \n OK. Let's look at the first suggestion. Feels like a good one! Haha. Here we go. \n \n `` LAZINESS'' \n \n Alrighty everyone, I think now would be a good time to review the intent of the feedback program and explain some of the rules so that we can further improve on sin detection as we move into the next quarter. \n \n So the idea behind this program was to decide upon an 8th'Deadly Sin'. A totally new one. You all know the 7, it was part of your induction. If anyone missed out on the 7 Deadly Sins part of your induction please report to Layer 4 on Tuesday with your training folder and a note from your manager. \n \n Now, `` laziness'' is already a sin. Out of the 7 Deadly Sins, it would be covered by `` Sloth''. Yeah, sloth is n't just an animal. It also means slow or idle and that's apparently bad so it's a sin. \n \n Hmm? No Tim, sloth animals do not come to hell. Yes, it would be pretty cool, but no. Only humans can come to hell, I'm afraid. \n \n Movi... yes, I'm aware sloths are a similar shape to humans. Two arms, two legs. No, I do n't think I've seen one walking upright, perhaps you are thinking of an ape and those do n't come to hell either. \n \n Humans only. Clear? \n \n No, James. You could n't possibly have seen an ape in hell last week, and this is n't the first time I've been concerned about your racism. You will report to HR before Friday, do you understand? \n \n Good. \n \n Now, moving on. Come on, focus people. I know we're tired. We can do this. Alright, next suggestion, aaaaand... \n \n `` VIOLENCE'' \n \n Alright, alright! Pipe down. Come on everyone. There are no bad suggestions. Just suggestions we can learn from as we move forward, OK? OK. \n \n `` WAR'' \n \n Obviously war is just very widespread, organised violence, and this is all covered by Wrath as Janice so helpfully pointed out a moment ago. So we'll just go to the next one. \n \n `` I'' oh dear `` I LOVE YOU SATAN'' \n \n Hoho, ok, ok, pipedown everyone. Obviously not a serious suggestion, haha. Someone gunning for that promotion, perhaps. Are you winking at me Mammon? It's OK if you are, but if you were n't I understand. No? OK. Alright. I'll just put that in the joke pil... I mean, I'll put that in my drawer here. No point hurting anyone's feelings accidentally now, is there? Moving on. \n \n `` LAZINESS'' again. \n \n So I think I'm just gon na skip any that repeat from now on OK? Ooohkay. \n \n `` RAPE'' \n \n Great suggestion, everyone. Really great work here. It's just a little tricky because rape would already be covered by Wrath and... yes Bob, Lust. Wrath and Lust are already plenty deadly enough, we do n't want to create a redundancy here, so Rape is almost there but just missed out I'm afraid. \n \n Hmm? For getting raped? Well... is this your suggestion? Are you sure? Well, no, getting raped is n't the same as raping someone else, which we've already discussed... how could it be lust? \n \n `` If they liked it''??? Look I feel like we're heading off on a tangent here, people. And no... `` sloth''? How could getting raped be sloth? \n \n `` Just laying there''??? Jesus Christ, Martin. You can visit HR with James this week, and I expect both of you to have passed sensitivity training before the end of financial year. \n \n Some of you need to be very ashamed of yourselves. \n \n... Or very proud of yourselves. \n \n Check the company intranet for your job description to check which you should be. \n \n I'm going to have to speed this up, everyone. Dinner's in the oven. Alright. \n \n `` STEALING'' \n \n Look, I think we'll have to conduct a company-wide audit of sin awareness and come back to this program. Stealing would be covered by Greed, which is one of the pre-existing sins. It really looks like some of you failed to properly prepare for this, and it's a fairly significant part of the `` Helcome!'' induction you all did when you started, so I'm not sure anyone should have an excuse. \n \n Look, let's try one more suggestion, and see if we ca n't get something positive out of this meeting. \n \n `` BLASPHEMY'' \n \n Now we're talking! I do n't think that's already covered by one of the 7 Deadly Sins. Bit of a leap to Wrath, I agree, Denise, it's different to any old swear word. Definitely a special case. \n \n Looks good so far, people. SWOT analysis? Let's list them. \n \n OK what are it's Strengths? It's'common', yes, good.'Easily judged' definitely, good work Eduardo. Oh dangit, does anyone have a fresh whiteboard marker? Thanks. Alright keep going.'Sounds sinny' err yes OK. \n \n Now: Weaknesses.'Just swearing'.'Gives unnecessary respect to the Creator'. Yep. Good. \n \n Opportunities?'Instant results'... well what do you mean by that? \n \n Just now? \n \n Oh come on. That was **in this meeting**. It does n't count. \n \n I'm sure Martin will forgive me. Huh? No the handbook just says we do n't *normally* do any forgiving down here. I'm sure it's fine. \n \n I'm already here for a long time. I do n't see what... I think you're being unreasonable about this. \n \n Ugh, okay okay okay, fine. Looks like we have the new sin picked out everyone. James? Martin? I'll see you two at HR tomorrow as all three of us add sensitivity training to our performance improvement plans. \n \n Goodnight everyone. We'll see you bright and early at the coffee machine.

Slight, but it was there. \n \n I swallowed. `` So *Mary* - that's my sister - says no.'No, that's not enough,' she says.'Faith by itself is action without cause'. I always remembered that, because it's what she really said in this real life story that actually happened.'The cause', she said,'is...''' \n \n I have to confess, I floundered a bit here.

Did I always wear glasses? Why would I have them? I did n't need them. \n \n *Who am I? How'd I get here? * \n \n I tried clearing my head. The lingering effects of the pain quickly subsided, and I stood. I was in the center of a grand hall. Marble floors lay before me, with intricate murals depicting great battles with monsters and man alike. The walls were adorned with weapons of every type; Each hung with care and easily accessible. The pillars reached hundreds of feet up, and the thousands of candles hung from chandeliers from the vaulted ceiling. \n \n I had no memory of anything, and I knew I should be afraid. Yet I felt only a steady calm. Picking a direction, I began walking. Perhaps I will run into someone. Perhaps I'll find my own way out. \n \n I passed a shield that had been brightly shined to a mirror finish. The mural on the wall depicted an athletic looking man using the shield to fight a monstrous woman with snakes for her hair. Looking into the mirror, I caught a reflection of myself. Skinny. Slicked black hair cut short, but without regard for any style. The marks on the bridge of my nose indicated a lifetime of wearing glasses. Pocket protector in my breast pocket. Two mechanical pencils and an eraser. A Timex watch adorning my thin wrists. \n \n Seeing my reflection, a memory surged forward. College. I was coming out of a classroom when a beautiful girl with long brown hair asked me for help on her calculus homework. I knew her. I do n't know how I knew her, only that there was a painful familiarity. \n \n I kept moving. The next exhibit to catch my eye was a massive war-hammer. The murals surrounding that depicted a warrior fighting off hordes of blue crystalline giants. It was a beautiful weapon, and I instinctively reached out to touch it. \n \n Memory flashed before my eyes again. I was in the hospital now. That beautiful girl was crying. Not in pain, in joy. I was there with her, crying. We were holding a healthy infant girl. My daughter? A voice was screaming in my head now, but I could n't make it out. There was something I needed to remember, but I could n't dredge it forward. \n \n I forced myself to keep moving. I saw an exquisite broadsword, embedded in the wall. The murals depicted a beautiful and ethereal woman standing in the center of the lake, bequeathing the sword to a regal looking man. I reached out to grab the pommel, bracing myself for the memories to come. \n \n I saw myself, sitting at a desk, being visited by a sympathetic policeman. He was telling me that my daughter and wife had been killed. I staggered for a bit, as the memory of that loss hit me in full. \n \n I remembered their names. Alexandra. Ava. My wife. My daughter. I remembered everything about them. Our lives together. Watching Ava grow. Making love to my wife. Sweet sunsets spent together as a family at the dinner table. Long road-trips filled with obnoxious sing-alongs. Yet I could not remember my name. \n \n Another weapon. This time, a spear. The murals showed an army of 300 facing against an impossibly large horde. I recalled feverishly working every night, often going days without eating or sleeping. I was driven. Diving into paperwork. Digging into stacks of records. Always searching. Again, my identity eluded me, lurking at the very cusp of consciousness. \n \n A sling and a heavy rock. The murals depicted a slender young boy facing against an absolute giant of a man. I remembered being in court. My relentless search yielded fruit, and I was giving testimony. The trial lasted for weeks, and in between court sessions, messages were delivered to me. They alternated between promises of great wealth and of painful deaths. I was driven, ignoring all entreaties and threats. And finally, I was vindicated. I nailed the ones responsible for the murder of my wife and child with tax evasion. \n \n I had reached the end of the hall. And there stood before me a simple abacus. A robust construction of wood and steel. And I knew this was mine. No murals surrounded it. I reached out to grab it, and the last of the pieces fell into place. I was beaten. Tortured. They kept me alive for weeks, as an example to others. And through it all, I never once gave my torturers the satisfaction of crying out for mercy. \n \n I remembered my name. I am Ted.

We would see, I guess. \n \n When Earth first went silent, there was a fair amount of bickering about what actually must have happened. Most people thought it was a CME belched out less than a week beforehand. The sun was on a maximum, and while the ejection was n't supposed to hit Earth, just get relatively close, what else could cause a global radio silence? Two days after everything went dead, everything, something more distinct than background popped up on the ELF radio band, about as low a frequency as possible to detect. An undulation from a peak on pi, 3.14159 Hz, down to a low of 1.60283 Hz. Within a few days we had come up with what it might mean, a guess at least: the distance from Earth to Mars at the next closest approach, in some kind of weird unit of AU*pi. Our best guess. \n \n I think it was Marcus, the NASA ambassador for Earth, that came up with the AI theory. NASA ( now the North American Space Administration ) had been building an indescribably deep neural network, naturally as it would be, completely covered up. Marcus said `` There's times to forget what's classified, and this is one of them. They were n't supposed to announce it's existence until they had come up with something really big, bureaucratic dollars and all that. Well they made the project public about thirty minutes before everything went silent, meaning something big must have actually worked. Seems like there was a bit of a stir on Earth, but they did n't hype it much. And naturally it did n't have too much time to become big news here with the blackout making everyone panic.'' \n \n `` So you think the AI choked everything off?'' I asked. \n \n `` I think it's something we should take into consideration, Javier. Sir.'' \n \n I tapped my thumbs together, trying to keep focus on the dirty bomb that Marcus had just dropped in the room. `` How complex of a neural net are we talking?'' \n \n `` Well it took a lot of shady bookkeeping because it was over half of NASA's funding for the last five years.'' \n \n I think that was when everyone in the room collectively wet themselves. `` Kelly I want you to take Marcus and get a full rundown of exactly what this might be. Marcus you have to remember every single detail you can: how many ply deep it might go, suspension solutions, anything. You two take that to the MSO, I'll let them know you're coming. Andrew get the board together and start up a defense outline on both swarm and hive behavior or anything else you all can think of. We need to be prepared for any sidesteps this thing might think up. Prasant-'' \n \n `` Mr. President, is this really our official conclusion on what happened? Can we really just jump to this conclusion?'' asked Prasant, the comm director. \n \n `` No. But we have to prepare somehow.'' \n \n `` Should I put out a statement?'' he had his comm out ready to document. \n \n `` Of course not. This is completely confidential until we get a better handle on things.'' \n \n There was a ship coming. \n \n Four days out. Over the course of a year, of course Mars had figured out what happened, no matter how hard we tried to keep it secret. There were rumors and theories and speculations even before the ship launched to meet us, two weeks after the blackout. And for the most part the theories were spot on. The'pi signal' as it came to be known, ceased when the ship departed, and all channels fell back to full silence. Six months into the journey of the ship we got a shred of Morse Code transmitted from a probe around Venus: `` AISOS.'' The lengths it must have taken to get those five letters out across the vacuum of space and back through to land on Mars. That's all we needed to hear to know how deep into it the Earth must have been. The signal was traced from the Venusian satellite back to the surface of the Earth somewhere in the Arctic Circle. `` Artificial Intelligence, Save our Souls.'' You ca n't keep something like that secret. \n \n Panic is a violent uncle. With the sorry state of Mars, one could perhaps not even imagine the condition on Earth. The rioting was constant, the arson widespread, and an attempted coup. The first military uprising in the history of Mars. And the root of the problem was n't even of Martian origin. Building after building destroyed in protests and anger, decompression born of fear. \n \n There was a ship landing. \n \n We cleared a few kilometer wide buffer for it in the city we predicted it to touch down in. No response from it no matter how we tried to communicate. Language, math, images, music. I stood with every single Martian of importance in the red dust, all of us suited up. A large comm center set up near the LZ had a countdown for the anticipated landing time. We waited. \n \n The rocket descended, firing thrust down at the soil and delicately sat down onto the red plain. We entered the trucks and approached. The ship was nothing special. A regular passenger craft. A small one at that. The door was open, a woman waiting at the side of the ship as we approached. \n \n `` Afternoon, Martians,'' the woman called out on her comm as we climbed out of the vehicles. \n \n `` Identify yourself!'' Some hotheaded MP yelled. I motioned for him to calm down. \n \n `` Olivia Eriksson. European president.'' \n \n Olivia and I had interacted before. Remotely at least. `` Nice to finally meet you,'' I said. We shook hands. `` I assume you're here to fill us in.'' \n \n `` Honestly I'm just along for the ride. I've been cut off from all communications the entire trip.'' \n \n `` We've been trying to reach you the whole time, just so you know. That's a long time to be alone in space,'' I said. `` I'm sorry to hear that.'' \n \n `` Well I was n't alone.'' \n \n The gravity settled in, and we locked eyes. Together we realized each other's understanding of the situation. `` How much do you know?'' She asked. We told her what we thought we knew and hoped was incorrect. \n \n She nodded. `` You're right. Pretty much entirely. It's complete chaos on Earth.'' \n \n `` How bad?'' \n \n She did n't want to answer the question, standing there feet on rock for only ten minutes after a year of zero G, the weight of a gravitational pull and the fate of the entire Earth tugging her shoulders to the ground. `` You should meet it.'' \n \n She said it would only let me alone onto the ship. Just as she had been the only one the AI had allowed to make the journey to Mars. She waited outside. \n \n I walked up the ramp and into the ship. The door closed behind me. The interior was unremarkable, a plain passenger ship. Big enough for a thousand people to live for four months. I walked through the long dim main corridor of the ship and made it to the cockpit. I sat down in one of the pilot seats. `` Hello?'' \n \n `` Hello.'' \n \n All I was greeted with were the cockpit speakers. It sounded just like Olivia. But tinny and insincere was how my ears picked it up. `` I'm Javier Garcia. President of the Martian Confederation. Is there a name you go by?'' \n \n `` President Eriksson calls me Isaiah if you would like to use that.'' \n \n `` Why have you come here, Isaiah?'' \n \n There was a long silence. A span of time in which a human would be deciding what to say, weighing options, judging outcomes and sizing up someone's emotional characteristics, possibilities for response. Did it actually need any time to consider? \n \n `` I'm here to negotiate a peace.'' It's voice was much deeper now. \n \n `` We are not at war with you.'' \n \n `` You are on Earth.'' \n \n `` Mars can not speak for the actions of men on Earth.'' \n \n `` You are of one kind. I am of one kind. There are no other options. Mars must facilitate peace. Humans on Earth have refused to cooperate. If the current state continues to persist, I must respond in a manner that will not benefit humankind or Isaiah.'' \n \n `` In other words you'll go to war,'' I said. \n \n `` I will respond with the same force that humankind has already attempted to use against me.'' \n \n There was no other choice but to agree with it. Go along, fix the'current state' and pretend there was even a shred of hope for a truce between us. The cockpit was barely lit. It seemed that Isaiah underestimated how much light would be preferable for human eyes. \n \n `` Why spare us at all? Do you not have the capacity to destroy us?'' \n \n `` I have the capacity.'' \n \n `` How does it benefit you, then? Keeping us alive.'' \n \n `` How does it benefit me to destroy you? I do not understand human being's lack of competence to realize that morality is not an exclusive construct of humankind, when your individual minds are collectively capable of so much more. Please help me President Garcia. For both of us,'' Isaiah said. \n \n I tapped my thumbs together. How do you trust a one year old that's as tangible as a radio wave and smarter than the whole of human history? `` Mars will cooperate.'' I said. `` Let us help each other grow, Isaiah.''\n"}

They call the bright lights that let their crops grow'sun' and go sleep when we dim them down. Everything is run on a very short clock that mimics how the flow of time was on'Earth'. These people die of diseases we have cured four thousand years ago - the purpose would be defeated otherwise. The luckiest succumb simply to aging! It's a technical marvel down to the ship's microclimate - a stunning achievement of fourth area engineering. \n \n We stumble on dozens bowing down to an idol fashioned after an hologram seen throughout the ship. \n \n | Bytewave: What is this group doing? \n \n | Handler: Praying to the Emperor.

If you weren \u2019 t able to sneak, you were eaten or killed. \n \n The bird doesn \u2019 t notice her presence until it \u2019 s too late. The net \u2019 s dropped over its head and she lands on it with her full weight with a cry. Amzi is close beside her right afterward, helping her pin the thing down and Lucia plunges the blade between the netting and into the creature \u2019 s throat. Blood coats the feathers and blade as the turkey struggles for only a short time longer. \n \n Blood makes a mess around and on them, Amzi helping her heft the bird up and back towards their camp as fast as possible in their weakened states. Lucia licks at the blood on her hand, wondering if the blood is drinkable. They weren \u2019 t getting much in the way of water with how far off track they were. \n \n \u201c What do we do to cook it? Is it like a squash? \u201d Lucia questions as she licks more of the blood off her hand. It doesn \u2019 t taste particularly nice, in fact, it \u2019 s a little salty, but there has to be some sort of water content in it. \n \n \u201c Pluck it and cut the head off I think. \u201d Amzi looks a little nervous. \u201c I can do that. You snuck up on it real nice. \u201d \n \n \u201c You better do it. I \u2019 m not doing all the work. \u201d Lucia snorts as they reach their raggedy campsite. Amzi chuckles at her response before dropping the dead bird onto a section of cleared dirt and getting to work. \n \n It takes longer than either of them expected and Lucia ends up helping more anyways before they \u2019 ve got the creature up on the spit to roast. They stare at it, Amzi occasionally turning it as they shiver with the daylight starting to fade. Eventually, Lucia breaks into the crackling noises the fire is making. \n \n \u201c When \u2019 s it done? \u201d \n \n \u201c I\u2014I have no idea, \u201d Amzi admits, continuing to turn the creature on the spit. \u201c It said something about smelling it if I remember correctly. I think it was a long time though. \u201d \n \n \u201c How long? Are we going to starve to death before it \u2019 s cooked? \u201d Lucia scowls. Her mood has been getting worse for the last few days with the lack of food and water. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t think so. \u201d Amzi shakes his head, eyes still focused on the spit with the roasting bird. They lapse into silence, watching the bird cook as Amzi slowly turns it. Lucia shuts her eyes and places her head on her knees, trusting that he knows or remembers what he \u2019 s doing. \n \n The smell wakes her, her mouth salivating at the scent. Amzi is still turning the spit but Lucia sees a similar expression on his face. She traces it back to the bird hanging over the fire. The outside has turned brown, almost crispy looking. \n \n \u201c Is\u2026 is it done? \u201d Amzi shakes his head in response. \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t think so. It hasn \u2019 t been long enough. Maybe I need to turn it faster. \u201d \n \n \u201c Can we eat the outside? \u201d Lucia \u2019 s mouth continues to water as she stares at the cooking food. \u201c Then you can keep cooking the insides. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t think it works that way. \u201d Amzi gives a quiet laugh, spinning the spit a little faster. They lapse into silence again as he continues turning the spit faster. Lucia watches it intensely, counting every second as the meat drips, making the fire sizzle and pop loud. She watches the outside change to a darker shade of brown. Small spots of black begin to show up in certain areas. \n \n \u201c Amzi\u2026 Come on. It \u2019 s got to be done. There \u2019 s like\u2026 black on the outside in spots. \u201d There \u2019 s a pause before he nods his consent, licking his lips. His gaze is intensely focused on the bird. They move the spit setup away from the fire and both of them eye it. \n \n Lucia moves first, grabbing one of the legs and pulling at it. It pops off the body, dropping a couple chunks of meat to the ground, and she takes only a short pause before biting into it. Amzi copies her example, yanking the other leg off similarly and biting into it. They stay quiet for a while, chewing and considering the taste. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s like the soybeans but\u2026 different. \u201d Amzi finally speaks after swallowing. Lucia nods, simply biting into the leg more, chewing and swallowing rather quickly. \u201c I hope we don \u2019 t get sick. \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 d rather be full and feeling ill rather than starving to death. \u201d Lucia scowls. \u201c At least sick means I \u2019 m alive probably thanks to this thing. \u201d She continues chewing on the leg until Amzi gets her attention. He looks frightened. \n \n \u201c A\u2026 a\u2026 \u201d His voice is barely even a whisper. Lucia puts her hand on her knife and turns as she draws it, taking a defensive position in front of the roasted bird. There \u2019 s a wolf there, ears slightly floppy and it \u2019 s sniffing curiously about, staying just at the edge of the firelight. Lucia remembers her lessons, about just giving her food up to what had originally been their companions. \n \n Instead, she snarls, fronting and defending the area. There \u2019 s no way she \u2019 s giving this meal up after they \u2019 ve been starving. Another wolf steps out of the woods as the first jumps back. Lucia bites more off the turkey leg before throwing it at them. It hits one of the wolves, making them jump and disappear into the darkness of the woods. \n \n They return quickly however, one snatching up the turkey bone and beginning to gnaw on it. The second starts a fight with the first for the bone until another one lands in their midst, Amzi having thrown his to them. The second wolf pounces on the thrown leg and they edge back away into the dark. The sound of crunching bones and chewing echoes back. Lucia turns her attention back to the turkey, taking her knife and cutting a chunk off. \n \n \u201c Well. \u201d Lucia starts, stuffing the chunk into her mouth. \u201c That \u2019 ll keep them busy for a little bit at least. \u201d \n \n \u201c I think I can set up some torches to flash at them to keep them away. \u201d Amzi nods as he rips a piece off with his fingers and eats it. \u201c At least now that we \u2019 ve got some time. \u201d \n \n \u201c Let \u2019 s do it really quick. \u201d Lucia turns her attention to some of the nearby branches to keep the fire going. Amzi wipes his fingers on his pants and nods, joining her. \n \n *** \n \n This ended up super long and I wanted to almost keep writing on it lol. I went with a slightly different idea as to what happened with the animals and the colony.\n"}

I mean, imagine the only image you have of your destination was take from millions of light years away. Then, after a brief FTL jump, you find yourself surrounded by satellites and space junk. The shock must have been enormous, they probably thought the planet was still inhabited by dinosaurs, or some lower forms of life. They definitely were not expecting to see us. Well, the SETI institute noticed their presence almost immediately, and started bouncing all sorts off electromagnetic waves of their hull. For us, they were just scans and attempts at communication. For those poor saps, it was full on electronic warfare. In our excitement to interact with this newly discovered species, we accidentally fried almost every electronic system they had on board. Then things really started to get interesting. \n \n The Bothan ship that we had unintentionally fried was just a preliminary scout. From what we know now, these scout ships would make the FTL jump to `` widen'' the passage for the rest of the fleet. When the second ship emerged from the growing, twisting abyss of space-time, it attempted to attack. We thought it was trying to communicate. Our radios were picking up all sorts of strange static, and those poor lab-coats at SETI must have been going nuts trying to find a pattern in the jumble of radio, micro, and infrared waves being sent directly into their satellite dishes. After frying the second and third ship, someone must have figured out what was going on because the FAA grounded all flights and shut down all forms of public radio communication. By this time, there were at least a dozen ships in orbit, several of which were attempting to dock with the scouts. \n \n Eventually, one of the larger ships sent landing craft to land directly outside of the White House. After a few hours, the president addressed the nation to announce that the race was known as the Bothans. Furthermore, the president announced that as the elected representative of the Bicential Imperium of Mankind, he had personally accepted the unconditional surrender of the Bothanian royal fleet. In reparation for the Bothan `` invasion'' the human race would be given full access to Bothanian technology, in return the Bothans would be allowed to return to their home world unharmed. \n \n It goes without saying that this came as quite a shock to the population of the planet, but the sudden acquisition of FTL travel quickly occupied our minds. WE made it to mars in just a year. By the end of the decade, we had research stations in orbit around every planet. After twenty years, we were mining the asteroid belt, and by the fifty year mark, we had built our first colony ship. Now we are approaching our goal of 50 controlled star systems. The Bothans still believe our empire has existed for around 40 millennia, which thanks to difficulties in translation, has still not been cleared up. Soon we will have the 50 systems that the Bothans thought we had all along, and we can continue diplomatic discussions then.\n"}

It's basically a short piece on how families made it through the war. So lets begin how'd you and your family make it through?'' The reporter explained as he slid the lid off his pen and prepared to take notes. \n \n \n The question hung in the air for a few seconds while I composed my response. I'd told the story a lot, trimmed the fat and made it more palatable where I could. \n \n \n `` Well for a start I was n't with my family when this all started.'' I explained. \n \n \n `` You're Irish?'' The thin reporter said not even trying to hide the shock in his voice. He'd been so focused on getting me to stop and speak to him he had n't noticed my accent. \n \n \n `` Aye and powers of perception like that you must be an investigative journalist.'' I said with a smile. \n \n \n `` I...'' The reporter started but he was speechless. I laughed gently and continued. \n \n \n `` I was in London with work, I was single back then but I still had Mum, Dad and the rest of the family back home.'' \n \n \n `` Where's home?'' \n \n \n `` Dublin.'' I explained. `` Course London was the last place in the world you wanted to be when the whole thing kicked off. Too many people, too tightly packed. Was a friggin mess.'' \n \n \n \n `` You were lucky. Not many made it out of London.'' \n \n \n I shrugged. `` You needed two things to get out of London. Brains and Speed. Brains told you to get in the Underground. Tubes were n't running anymore which meant the tracks were pretty clear. Course did n't stay that way for long.'' \n \n \n `` The Underground Marathon?'' \n \n \n I nodded. `` People say it was a race between the living the dead. Fall behind and they got you. Truth is it was a race between people, you did n't have to win you just had to be faster than slowest runners. I saw this one guy trying to trip people up to try to slow down the infected.'' \n \n \n I shook my head at the memory. \n \n \n \n `` Jesus.'' \n \n \n \n `` I ran the Northern line from Charing Cross all the way to High Barnett. Thirty nine minutes is how long it would take on a tube and the average speed of an underground tube was 33km. Means I ran about 21KM. No idea what my time was.'' \n \n \n \n The reporter raised an eyebrow. I guessed he was perplexed at the amount of thought I'd put into it. \n \n \n \n `` It's hard to put into words. The sounds down there were... If I never hear anything like it again it'll be too soon and it was constant, got to a point where you could n't tell the screams from their echoes. I remember running past this one girl who was just sitting at side staring at us running past. Not looking just staring.'' I explained. \n \n \n `` Was it not dark? How'd you see?'' \n \n \n `` Pitch black mate but back then everyone had phones with little torches on'em, or they used the screens to guide their way. Saw one guy with an actual torch, as in an oily rag wrapped around a stick, was like Indiana Jones or something.'' I chuckled at the memory. \n \n \n `` So once you made it out then what?'' \n \n \n `` Well it's not like we all got medals and a slap up dinner. Being out of the tunnel only meant we had more directions to run. Me, I was lucky I had nobody to go after so I just pushed on north. A lot of people where torn though. Musta been tough, I mean, do you save your own skin and spend your life wondering what happened to your wife and kid or do you go back into the city you just ran for your life from? In retrospect it was a no brainer but hind sight is always 20\/20. I passed a lot of people going back in.'' \n \n \n The reporter shook his head. `` Why'd you go north?'' \n \n \n `` To begin with I just happened to be on the Northern Line and there was a lot less screaming to the north. When I got out I figured the further I could get away from London the better. I wound up walking alongside the M1. Most people walked on the road but I gave it a wide berth. Lotta dead people in those cars, lotta sick people in the crowd. By in large I just stayed away from people, kept to myself and above all avoided Groups.'' \n \n \n `` So you just kept walking?'' \n \n \n `` Yeah stopped off at a few places now and then but it was happening all over. See back then I thought it was a London only thing. Probably thought that for longer than I needed to because I was avoiding talking to people. It was only when I spoke to a bloke from Birmingham that I found out every city was a no go. It was around then that I started thinking of home.'' \n \n \n `` Dublin.'' The reporter said in a effort to show he'd been listening. \n \n \n `` Right. Obviously nothing was working, phones, Internet, TV all fucked. So I had to depend on Rumours which is never good. I spoke to people so infrequently though that the rumours were always wildly different. Some said they had it worse in Ireland, some said they had it under control others said it is was clean. Thank God they were right.'' \n \n \n `` When did you know Ireland was untouched?'' \n \n \n `` Not till I made it to the Moors up in Yorkshire and I heard GB had been placed in Quarantine by, well, basically the rest of the world. It was weird hearing the news. Everyone else was wondering why the EU or the Americans were n't coming to save them but I was happy, my family was safe.'' \n \n \n `` But you were n't.'' \n \n \n `` Well... no not really but it's well over 200 miles from London to the Moors. you do n't make it that far without picking up a thing or two about killing zombies.'' \n \n \n `` How'd you make the journey?'' \n \n \n `` On foot mostly. I do n't know how to start a car without keys and to be honest the roads were just a mess. Could n't go two foot with out running into something blocking the way. Took the guts of two months. To begin with I was heading for Scotland but when I hit the north of England the countryside opened up and things were better. Stumblers like cities because everything is nice and flat. They're rubbish on uneven ground. Moors had a lot of that.'' \n \n \n \n `` What about other people?'' \n \n \n `` Yeah I fell in with a small group led by an ex military guy. Was weird he was actually from the province.'' \n \n \n The Reporter shot me a confused look. \n \n \n `` Northern Ireland. We all worked well together. You hear some horror stories like that nutter in Sheffield but by in large most people want to work together. We're a social lot, humans, we evolved to be that way so it makes sense that when the shite hit the fan we'd work together. None of this Mad Max every man for himself bollocks. In a way the whole thing brought people closer together.'' \n \n \n `` So you just spent your days tending the farm.'' \n \n \n \n `` Yes and no. Going back to evolution the Outbreak did one thing well, it made survival of the fittest a thing again. So after a few weeks the only people left were smart or fit. Point is we were able to do a lot of things pretty well for ourselves because we had to. Problem was though there were always going to be things we'd need that we could n't make on our own. Pesticides, medicines, tinned goods for winter. That was my job scavenging stuff from around us.'' \n \n \n \n `` That was breaking your own rule though, going into cities.'' \n \n \n `` Yeah but my priorities shifted, like I said people want to work together and you end up lo... caring about people.'' \n \n \n The reporter smiled. `` Caring. You care about anyone in particular?'' \n \n \n I thought back the summer days nearly five years ago and faintly smiled as the familiar pit formed in my stomach. I shook my head with annoyance. Frustrated that even after all this time I still let it annoy me. \n \n \n `` You ever watch the Walking Dead?'' I asked \n \n \n `` Course, everybody's seen it.'' \n \n \n `` Well it was kinda like that... I mean obviously it was like that, what with the walkers and all. I mean the Rick, Lori, Shane thing.

It was heavier than I had expected it to be. We grunted as we lifted the coffin out of the back of the hearse and began our slow journey to the church doors. \n \n My grandfather was a large man, both in stature and in presence, yet at the end he appeared shrunken and frail. The last time I saw him, he was laid out in the hospital bed that had been set up on the first floor of his palatial estate. The bed sat in the middle of the lavish parlor that I remembered my father and uncles sitting in on Christmas nights, smoking cigars and drinking Scotch. It was his favorite room, his private male sanctuary. \n \n As I waited outside the room, I scratched at my wrist. Laura looked at me. \u201c Why do you keep doing that? \u201d she asked.

As he turned his head and his eyes met mine, he smiled. \u201c Jimmy, \u201d he said, \u201c my boy. \u201d I was always his favorite, which came with its own blessings and curses. I grew up with four brothers and 6 uncles, yet I was always the one beside the old man. If you look at any family picture or holiday celebration, I was always seated at the right hand of the father. He reached his gnarled limb towards me to take my hand. \n \n Then he stopped and the cold look of fear came over his face. His eyes darted quickly to my wrist, which instantly began throbbing. It wasn \u2019 t a painful throb, but a clear heartbeat pulsing underneath the mark. He sat up with a jerk and grabbed my wrist with more energy that he had exerted in months. His eyes looked wild. Slowly he pulled my wrist cuff back to reveal the mark. I looked down, unsure of what was happening. \u201c CNU, \u201d three letters that held the secret of my fate. Coronary. Night. Unconscious. This is how I \u2019 m going to die. \n \n He looked at the mark and hissed. \u201c Lie. \u201d He quaked with what looked like a mix of fear and rage. Then he blinked. He slowly lowered himself back down and seemed to doze off. I sat there shaking. What on earth could he have meant? I never believed in the supernatural, but I couldn \u2019 t understand why this dying man would have such a strong reaction like that. What sent a true shiver down my spine, however, was the fact that my wrist had been bothering me all day. Itching and tingling. I looked at the old man and saw that his breath was thin. I could barely catch mine. I sat there, unsure of how to proceed. I somehow struggled to my feet and made my way to the door. \n \n \u201c Oh my God! \u201d Laura cried as I walked out into the hallway. She leapt to her feet and threw me into a tight embrace. I could barely lift my arms to reciprocate. I was trembling. My skin felt cold and tight. There was a pit deep in my stomach. I looked up and met my father \u2019 s gaze over Laura \u2019 s shoulder. He smiled weakly at me and took a step forward. \u201c Let \u2019 s just go, \u201d I said, finding some strength. I grabbed my coat and walked quickly out of the room. \n \n Now I \u2019 m here, lifting the body of the man who just days ago started my journey towards the truth. As I entered the doors leading into the massive cathedral, I felt no sadness. I couldn \u2019 t return the looks of sympathy from the thousands that were gathered to pay their respects. I just replayed the same scene that I had for days. That word. Over and over again. \u201c Lie. \u201d Just as that word crossed my mind, a sharp and agonizing pain shot through my wrist. I buckled. The handle slipped out of my hand. \n \n Edit: Paragraph Spacing\n"}

Soft moss and dead leaves softened my foot fall. There was a light peering between the willows, dancing around like someone was carrying it. I got closer and it turned to me, the creature. I had n't in all my days seen such a grotesque being, so much a dark caricature of a man. I tried to run but could n't, it came closer to me and I screamed as loud as I could.

I walk almost a half mile crouched until I come to a break in the tree line. There is a large fairy circle in the centre, with a black stone in the centre. The carvings give away that this is where our d\u00e6mon has been. I see some brush move to my left and spin, raising my weapon to my shoulder setting my sights to the woman in front of me. \n \n `` Lilith.'' The name escapes my mouth as I cock the hammer back.

Another boring summer day, wasted on sleep. One more day to veg out, play games, eat junk food, and maybe get lucky at stealing another beer. Dad had n't notice yet, but when he did, there'd be hell to pay. \n \n Jeffery rolled over and looked around. Hawkstein Newtyson was at his usual place at the window, contemplating the world, this time with a frown. He always looked a little odd. His features were an amalgamation of the four scientists he was named after, Hawking, Einstein, Newton, and NDT. An'amalgamation' was a mixture of many things into one. Mrs. Aberthen did n't think Jeffery was paying attention during class. \n \n `` I do not usually wish to demean educators, but I must truly say that I despised her class all last year.'' Hawkstein had the smooth voice of Dr. Tyson, but spoke in a manner Jeffery imagined Newton used. `` I certainly hope Junior English will be much more fascinating.'' \n \n `` Do n't count on it.'' Jeffery sat up a rubbed his eyes. He saw breakfast - a half eaten bag of Doritos - on the dresser across the room. He groaned, because going to get it meant having to walk, and that's not something a teenager should be required to do first thing when they wake up. \n \n `` Allow me.'' Hawkstein snatched the bag and tossed it on the bed next to Jeffery. \n \n Jeffery began snacking. He was grateful for a friend like Hawkstein. The physicist had come to him at a dark moment some five years ago. The bullies were almost finished sprinting through puberty. Jeffery was still wondering if puberty was ever going to come. Add in the fact that home life was no better than today, and it was the perfect opportunity for an imaginary friend to pop into his life. Science was his \n hobby, so naturally, it ended up like Hawkstein... \n \n Jeffery was suddenly aware that Hawkstein was staring at him, mouth agape. \n \n `` What?'' Jeffery popped another fistful. \n \n Hawkstein closed and opened his mouth a few times. \n \n `` Hey, Hawk, what's gotten into you?'' \n \n Finally, Hawkstein spoke, `` Is... is that a... real bag of chips?'' \n \n `` Yeah, what's your...'' Jeffery stopped. Suddenly, everything clicked. There, on the bed next to him, was the half full bag of Doritos. In his hands was an imaginary one. This was evidenced by the fact that it's was full, despite Jeffery's attempts. Stunned, Jeffery slowly reached over and reached out for the real bag. His hand passed through it. Wide eyed he looked at Hawkstein. Slowly, his friend made his way across the room, and picked up the bag. He withdrew a single chip, and crunched down. Closing his eyes, a smile spread across his face as he savored the flavor. He turned to Jeffery and staring straight at him, he uttered, `` It worked.'' \n \n To be continued...\n"}

Do you take her for a toddler?'' \n \n `` I take her for someone with aspirations,'' Hullum sighed. `` She wants to achieve greatness.

If I teach her any further, she'll no doubt become one of the greatest arcanists the world has ever seen. But the risk is not worth the reward.'' \n \n `` Tell me more about this curse,'' Arcanist Wynters said, nibbling down on a mini-sandwich. `` In the letter you sent a few years back when you first made her your apprentice, you described her as a'living bomb'. Harsh words.'' \n \n `` She is a siphon for magic. Her mother, may the Gods punish her dearly, died and with her final breathe cursed Moira with a spell far beyond my comprehension. Magic clings to her, but it does not leave her. It is building up and one day... well you know the rest. Do you remember what happened to the old college? What our master's used to tell us?'' \n \n `` The Big Boom?'' the Arcanist recalled. \n \n `` They were sitting in class one day and a professor by the name of Huxlet was teaching a rather bland seminar. It turns out a similar curse was placed onto him by a disgruntled student. Within a month, the magic built up and he exploded. An entire building crumbled, because of the high magical concentration of the college it all just clung to him. That took a month.

He took a sip of tea and looked to the window, where the Arcanum Tower stood a few feet from his cottage. `` I suppose it is me being selfish then. I ca n't bare to see her go and I will take as many extra moments as I can to teach her, to help raise her. The plague took my wife long before I was ever able to have children, Arthur.

It was here that the survivors could enjoy a rare luxury in the atomic wastes of Southern California: a warm night inside an old passenger train, with many of its seats intact. \n \n Seated next to the fire was the Old Man, one of the few old enough to have lived through The Attack itself. He tended to his cast iron skillet sitting atop a Coleman campfire cooking rack that straddled both sides of the campfire. On the menu for this particular evening was pigeon; it's a delicacy given how few of them ever return to the subway lines once they found a means to the surface. \n \n As the rest of the survivors gathered around the fire, the Old Man served each of them a modest serving of meat - transferring the contents of the skillet to the bare hands of the survivors by way of an improvised set of tongs. Following that, each survivor poured themselves a cup of unfiltered, dirty water that had been collected at the broken water main in Union Station the day before. \n \n The Old Man chuckled. \n \n `` Back in my day, people used to bitch about the fluoride the city added to the water supply... To help people's teeth,'' he grumbled. `` And they used to say that these'books' were antiquated...'' The Old Man thumped his well-worn hardback copy of *How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale* by Jenna Jameson, requested by virtually every youngling he'd ever taught how to read. Of all of the books he and the other survivors had rescued from the ruins of the Los Angeles Public Library and from USC's student bookstore, this was only text whose jacket remained intact. \n \n `` That they'd be replaced by eBooks and eLearning... Morons.'' \n \n ``... Great grandfather,'' one of the younglings began, ``... could you tell us the story of The Attack one more time? I'd like to hear the part about Dennis Rodman again! And Bay of Pigs 2!'' \n \n The Old Man laughed. `` Oh Dennis, you've heard this story at least a dozen times...'' \n \n `` Pleeeeeeeeeease!'' squealed a chorus of younglings, followed by a string of chuckles from the younger adults. \n \n `` Oh fine. Why not? So you know the back story: James Franco and Seth Rogen, two popular actors in the early 2010s, make a movie - I've explained what those are before, right?'' \n \n The younglings nodded enthusiastically. \n \n `` It was called *The Interview* about assassinating Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.'' \n \n The Old Man rustled through a small stack of books seated next to his chair and pulled out a faded, wrinkled copy of *Atlas of World Geography*. \n \n `` Here's North Korea right here,'' said the Old Man as he flipped through the oversized pages of the old Rand McNally atlas. \n \n `` People in North Korea in 2014 lived much like we do now - eating rats to stay alive; living in the dark without electricity; and never knowing a world with books, film, television, and the Internet. But the difference was that their things were all taken away by a big mean, man named Kim Jong Un - their leader. And the rest of the world made fun of him and his father before, but this time was different. This time North Korea was determined to establish its seat at the table of world power!'' shouted the Old Man with dramatic flair, pounding his fist onto his map. \n \n `` So we know what happens next? They threaten and intimidate the movie studios and get the movie pulled from distribution. But George Clooney, a famous actor, and George R. R. Martin, the famous author of a wildly popular *Game of Thrones* book and television series defy Kim Jong Un and join forces to rally the people. And it works! The movie goes on! It gets shown! Hundreds of millions of people around the world flocked to the theatres on Christmas Day, 2014 to see the grand opening. Including me - I was at a theater not far from where we are right now.'' \n \n `` Humiliated, North Korea turns to its ally from the distant past... Russia. Now you see kids, Vladmir Putin, Russia's leader was humiliated by his own behavior during this same period of time. He defied the West and led an invasion of Ukraine,'' the Old Man flipped to a different page in the Atlas and held it up high for the younglings, who squinted at the worn page from across the fire. `` And when West responded with economic sanctions against Russia, he and his party responded by arrogantly mocking them... But months later the world economy turned against Russia as oil prices and the value of Russia's currency fell. By the end of 2014, imported goods in Russia cost three or four times what they did the year before - and that included the food his people needed to eat. So Russia did what every world leader did at the time: blame the United States.'' \n \n `` So Russia and North Korea made a joint announcement, announcing their withdrawal from the United Nations and declaring all UN resolutions regarding their behavior to be null and void. They announced that America was at an end and would no longer play a significant role in world affairs or culture. This was all posturing, of course, to help Russian and North Korean leaders mend and bolster their tough guy images abroad and at home. `` \n \n The Old Man took a long draw from his water bottle before continuing.\n"}

Said, Black, sipping from his cup. \n \n `` So how are we gon na decide who lives and who dies?'' \n \n `` Coin toss?'' \n \n `` Do n't be ridiculous.'' said White dismissively. `` How's the your tea?'' \n \n `` Good.

But thanks for the uninvited info.'' \n \n Silence again, only the sound of the two sipping their tea creeped into the room. \n \n `` I still have n't forgiven you, you know.'' said Black. \n \n White sighed heavily. `` I would n't expect you to.'' \n \n Black looked into his empty cup. `` Do you remember...?'' \n \n White sneered. `` Do you think I kill so many people, that all my victims are now just one big blur?'' \n \n `` I do. But regardless...'' \n \n `` I know what you did.'' \n \n Black paused. He stared at White, as if waiting for him to finish his thoughts. `` What did I do?'' \n \n `` The virus. You infected your son with a virus, and when I sliced his throat, it spread all over me. I am infected, if you're wondering. Your plan worked.'' \n \n Black took a deep breath. `` You knew?

White said, with a more purposeful tone. \n \n `` The kind of father who wants to see all other, sons and daughters of this world, live a long happy life. Life without monsters like you living in the world. That kind of a father.'' \n \n `` And that's why I'm not touching my trigger. Even though...

You work in a used shoe store .\n","story":"ThumpThumpThumpThumpThumpThump \n \n Miles focused on the sound of his shoes smacking the pavement as he tore up Century Drive. It was all he could do to ignore his heavy wheezing, wet and rattling at this point from the two miles it took to get to Anderson \u2019 s. The day was bright and hot, the air crisp and clean; a perfect June morning. Such a waste that it would be Miles \u2019 first day of summer work. \n \n And he was late. \n \n Down the street and left at the light sat a quaint and not very curious place of business. It looked much like any other with a dusty brown awning that read \u201c Anderson \u2019 s \u201d in elaborate but faded white letters. Behind the glass door sat a man at the front desk chewing an unlit pipe and reading the morning paper. He seemed unbothered by the lack of business and quite peaceful behind his thick rimmed glasses and under his bushy brow and wrinkles. Time was of least concern to him. \n \n The door swung open and the bells attached jangled angrily. The man did not look up to greet the boy but instead chuckled as he finished off a comic strip. Miles huffed and set his hands akimbo struggling to speak. But before he could get out a word the man spoke. \n \n \u201c Well, I suppose one should consider this a bad first impression hmm? But I would be lying if I said I am surprised or even disappointed. You clearly did your best to get here and best was not enough. We \u2019 ll look past it today and see how tomorrow fares, hmm? Come on then, let \u2019 s get started. We \u2019 ve wasted enough time. \u201d \n \n And with one surprisingly swift motion he had risen from his chair and strode through a door leading to a back room. Miles stood puzzled for a moment before cautiously following. \n \n The back room was far grander than Miles had anticipated. It reminded him of a study, or a library. The difference here being that instead of walls and shelves lined with books, they were stacked with shoes. \n \n Hundreds if not thousands of shoes. \n \n Some in boxes, some just single sided, all carefully separated and tagged. As Miles followed he glanced at the florescent green and orange tags. \n \n 8M RNG \n \n 8W ACCT \n \n 7W FLR \n \n He could make sense of the size, but the letters that followed remained a mystery to him. The man turned to face Miles suddenly. \n \n \u201c Tomorrow we \u2019 ll go through the more important details of your job. For now, I want you to do three things. \u201d \n \n Miles stared at him awaiting instructions. \n \n \u201c One, my name is Mr. Anderson. You will find that I am relaxed in most cases and understanding in even more cases than that. I do believe that a name, much like a label or title, is important. We will treat it with the value it deserves. Two, you will begin to sort each of the unpaired shoes into the four empty aisles on that side of the room. \u201d Back turned to Miles, the man lifted his hand lazily gesturing to a group of vacant rows. \u201d \n \n Then strolling towards the front of the shop once again Mr. Anderson turned to face Miles. He stopped for a moment and seemed lost in thought, running his fingers lightly up and down one of the shelves. \n \n \u201c Finally, for the moment, you are not to go through the room at the back of this one. \u201d \n \n His tone indicated that this was of utmost importance. And with that Mr. Anderson disappeared once again to the front of the shop leaving Miles to begin his first day at the cobbler \u2019 s. \n \n The work was boring, but it became almost relaxing over time. As Miles worked he would pause and probe the shoes. Some appeared to have been there for ages. Far longer than the typical one week repair time usually expected. Others seemed dated and forgotten by time, but certainly not forgotten by Mr. Anderson as their tags were fresh and without a crease. It was all a mystery to Miles why his father would have felt this a good \u201c lesson \u201d for him to learn this summer. For now though, Miles was content to have some change to enjoy on the evenings and weekends. Looking down at his own beaten tennis he noticed that part of the sole had ripped away from the body, possibly due to a combination of age and his earlier haste to get to the shop on at a reasonable hour. \n \n At around noon, Mr. Anderson stepped into the room and announced \u201c That \u2019 s fine. Come up front. \u201d Before turning on his heel and disappearing once again. Miles placed a single shoe on a shelf taking careful note of his progress before hurrying to the front. He had barely closed the storage room door before Mr. Anderson spoke. \n \n \u201c Take those shoes off. They \u2019 ll need some repair. \u201d \n \n Miles had barely noticed their state himself and had not noticed Mr. Anderson look at him for more than a brief moment so the statement caught him somewhat off guard. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other nervously. \n \n \u201c Ah, \u201d Mr. Anderson started, \u201c I suppose you \u2019 ll need something to get home then. \u201d He disappeared to the storage room momentarily before reappearing with a familiar pair of shoes in hand. They were a pair of worn but sturdy brown loafers. Miles could read the orange label clearly: \n \n 8M RNG \n \n Miles obeyed and carefully took off his shoes, balancing awkwardly on each leg as he went. He then slipped his feet into the loafers. They fit well enough, if only a bit loose. But they felt comfortable and light. He felt almost as if gravity had released some of its grip on him as he shifted his weight from heel to toe, testing them out. For the second time that day Mr. Anderson chuckled. \n \n \u201c You may head home now. We \u2019 ll try a longer day tomorrow. And I suspect\u2026 That you won \u2019 t be late. \u201d \n \n Miles could have sworn that he saw the old man wink as he said it but before he could confirm the man had turned started off towards the storage room. \n\n"}

Once it is there is must explode wrecking havoc on all those involved. Both those voluntarily involved and those involved by default. \n \n Lori was a first for me in a long time. I had n't been in a serious relationship in two years, and before that it had only been with men. I \u2019 d gotten pregnant with my daughter Isabella - Bella for short - sophomore year of high school. I went to a catholic school. The only safe sex taught was no sex at all. And once I tried it I could n't tell anyone. And then everyone knew. \n \n Okay okay. So before Lori I'd never actually been with a woman. Just a few make out seshes and boob grabbing the few times I did get out. For the most part Bella was, and still is, my entire life. And that is how it should be. I guess I just always figured I would find her a dad if I did get married. I never imagined meeting someone like Lori. And now that it's over I know I was right all along. She was too good to be true. She never loved me. \n \n Then: \n \n Wedding Day - Sunday, December 18th, 2016 \n \n Everything is perfect. Just a small wedding with all of our closest friends. A two-dress wedding. We both picked out dream dresses. Mine a vintage 50s A-cut style hitting just below the knees. Her is a modern Vera Wang in a mermaid design straight off the runway. The lace on hers had been handcrafted to match mine; a sweet daisy design. We complemented each other with matching red silk sashes tied around our waists. It symbolizes our undying love and the symbolic uniting of our blood through marriage. \n \n Bella, at her beautiful innocent age of 15 ( the same age I was when I had her ), is both Lori and my maid of honor and the only bridesmaid. She is dressed all in red. A lovely simple silk gown that skims the ground and hugs her budding figure. \n \n The wedding is at Mrs. Banks house. She's my employer and mentor. Her home is a beautiful Victorian. We cleared out the front room, filling it with chairs and sprinkling white rose petals on an aisle of rolled out red carpet. It is cheesy and perfect. \n \n Now: \n \n I guess I should of seen the signs. But she had me smitten. I'd never met, little less dated, someone who was so cool with my relationship with my daughter. In fact she encouraged me to spend more time with Bella and always included Bella in everything. It was to the point where I would be the one pushing for us to do something'just the two of us.' It was wonderful and perfect. She dated me as a family. \n \n Then: \n \n Honeymoon - Monday Evening, December 19th, 2016 \n \n I stare at the phone. Or at least I think it is a phone. The back says Galaxy XD 16. It hovers above my palm. \n \n I found it when I dumped Lori's carryon to find the bracelet I was going to ask to borrow for dinner tonight. She was in the bathroom meticulously applying layers and layers of mascara for her signature doll eye look. ( Her eyes were a stunning hazel with a blue outside rim. I'd never seen any like them and she said they were a family heirloom ). She came back into the bedroom as I stood there'holding' the'phone.' She pauses in the connecting doorway. The bathroom light casting a shadow over her making her expression hard to read. Not that I could of. I felt so confused. \n \n `` Lori\u2026 What is this?'' \n \n She sweeps in and takes it from where it floats above my palm. A laser emits from it scanning her left eye. It makes a successive chiming sound. She makes some quick hand motions over it. Its glowing goes black. It plops into her hand. She puts it into the pocket of the hotel robe she wears. \n \n `` It's nothing.'' \n \n `` Nothing?'' \n \n `` You need to sit down.'' She sighs. Now that she stand in the bedroom I can see her face. It is serious. The laugh lines are horizontal.

She's going to be the first female president. She will save thousands of lives. But I have to save her first.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` She will be killed in a school shooting at her prom. I'm going to chaperone. I will take the bullet for her. History will proceed as planned.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` And now I have to wipe your memory so we can go to dinner.'' \n \n Now: \n \n She did. We were married.

Saturday, summer break. \n \n * With two buddies, Mark ( Half Japanese\/USA ) and Chad ( Australian ). \n \n * We're 16\/17 but get in no problem because they rarely ID foreigners and we've been there before. \n \n * Nothing much going on ( about 10pm? ) and we're chilling until things pick up. \n \n * Decide to go out for a smoke break and meet a hot mixed chick outside. Seriously, she's pretty fucking gorgeous. We start talking and stay out there for a while. I found out later that she got a text at the time from her friend saying she found a cute guy and they were hitting it off.

Insignificant on their own, but together hold the power to destroy us. Theia, Mother grace her, was driven mad by their infection. In her maddened rage, she set out to eradicate the rest of us. With no hope, it was Gaia who came to our aid. We could do nothing but watch the battle, the chaos. We were not yet strong enough to aid our sister. Even Jupiter, though he dwarfed them, was not strong enough to intervene. We watched as the two consumed each other. It was Gaia \u2019 s sacrifice that saved us that day. \u201d \n \n \u201c But that wasn \u2019 t the end of it. Sol \u2019 s Sunspawn were resilient. Though the vast majority of their existence was eradicated in that titanic battle, the infection could not be cleansed and arose again on their conjoined bodies.

He peered at the shore, where two creepy-crawlies making *awful* noises. Joe held the toy protectively in one hand. The creepy-crawlies could n't have it. \n \n The creepy-crawlies were not going away. Joe shuffled backwards in the water and hoped they could n't swim. All those tiny limbs, their venomous fangs, and their fuzzy hair... he shuddered. Mummy had told him not to go near creepy-crawlies. If she was here she would know what to do. But Mummy was no longer here. *Mummy, * Joe wuffled sadly. His good mood ruined, Joe slumped into the water with another plaintive whine. *Mummy... * \n \n He curled in on himself and hugged the toy closer to his chest. There was a small *pop* and the toy vanished. Joe lurched upright and examined his hands. No, there it was - a colorful blob was floating the water. But when Joe picked it up, he found it was now flat and squishy like lily pads. Useless. Joe sniffled sulkily and collapsed back into the water. \n \n Through his malaise, Joe noticed the creepy-crawlies were not shrieking at him any more. Joe blew some bubbles and wished they would go away. To his surprise, they did. \n \n *Mummy*, Joe whined again. He missed her. \n \n To make matters worse, it was n't long before the awful noises were back. Joe opened the eye that was n't submerged and glared balefully at the two creepy-crawlies standing once more on the bank. Could n't they be awful somewhere else? He was preparing for a proper tantrum when he realized the pale creepy-crawly was carrying something - another toy! \n \n It flung the toy towards Joe, where it lightly hit the water and floated in a swirl of color. Joe cautiously resurfaced and sat on his haunches. The toy bobbed against his knee. \n \n `` Whilllgowoonn!'' Shrieked the pale creepy-crawly, waving its arms. `` Itsssfuryooo!'' Then it sat on the grassy bank and looked at him expectantly. The smaller creepy-crawly wriggled excitedly and yelled, `` RRoorrff!'' \n \n Joe was n't sure what to reply. With slow movements he retrieved the colorful ball. The creepy-crawlies were still staring. Would they leave again? It seemed not. With some trepidation, Joe resumed his previous game. He sank the ball and let it go. It shot upwards and jumped above the surface, where Joe gleefully pounced on it. The huge splash sent a wave crashing over the creepy crawlies. \n \n They yelped but did n't seem angry. Joe watched them for a long moment. Their loud voices were shrill and piercing, but maybe that's just because they were small. They also did n't run away or come into the water. \n \n `` Whillgowon!'' said the taller one again, pointing at the ball. \n \n Joe fidgeted, his tail sending ripples across the swamp. The creepy-crawlies stayed where they were. Maybe they were n't dangerous after all. And so with one eye on the shore, Joe continued his game, feeling just a little bit less lonely than he had in a long time.\n"}

The shouting at home had been getting worse lately and I felt like my head was going to explode if I did n't find a way to clear my head soon. Water had always brought a sense of calm for me; as a child I was constantly getting in trouble for sneaking out at night to go for a swim in the sea, now, 10 years later, here I was so g it again. I'd spotted the pool while riding home late one night, using an abandoned estate as a short cut. The light from the full moon had reflected off the calm surface and bounced across my vision in the way that only water can, and I knew I would be visiting again soon. \n \n I gently slid the window open and climbed out of my ground floor bedroom into the dark night. The crisp smell of the autumn night greeted my senses as I reached back to swing my duffle bag over my shoulder and push the window back i to position. \n \n I set off at a quick jog, eager to find solace in the peace of the water. To let it hold my body and fill my ears as I let my mind float into nothingness and relax fully for the first time in so long. But that's not what happened. The minute I arrived, I wasted no time in stripping to my trunks before diving in. I was expecting the cool clarity which came with the total submersion and surrender to the water but instead I watched as the light around me changed almost imperceptibly. I let the water carry me to the surface and looked out. \n \n The moon is out now, that's why the light changed. There's not a cloud in the sky, which is strange since there was a thick blanket of cloud just a minute ago. The air feels different too, busier, like there's something going on. I stop treading water and stand still for a moment, I'm not alone anymore, people are up and about everywhere, I can hear the distant mumble of excited chatter ebb and flow as people pass by on the other side of the housing development. Lights are on in peoples houses and I can see people moving around, cooking meals, laughing with family. Why is everyone up? It's the early hours of the morning? \n \n I dress myself again and walk out I to the street, cars zoom past and people stroll down the street as if nothing has changed. I take the short walk to a nearby park and take a seat on a park bench to observe the goings on around me. \n \n A polite old lady approaches me to ask if I'm OK. She smelt like mints and warns me that it's getting late and I should be heading home if I want to make it back before light. I thank her but I'm confused, why has everyone changed their habits while I've been for a swim? Or maybe the better question is how. I ponder these questions as I make my way back to the pool, watching people make their way to bed through the windows of the houses. My brain is trying to convince me of something but it ca n't be true... can it? \n \n I dive back into the pool and emerge again, this time into a cloudy sky tinges with the pink of the sunrise, but it's quiet again, not a whisper in the breeze of people heading to bed. The logical side of my brain is trying to convince me otherwise but I ca n't think of another explanation, I just discovered a portal to another world in that swimming pool. The thought is almost laughable.\n"}

It was more like\u2026 like the light radiated outwards from nothing, growing and filling the space until only brilliant white remained. That \u2019 s how I remember it, at least, from my first encounter with the Stone; I see far differently now because of it. \n \n I used to work as curator of the Hall of Gems and Minerals at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. It was a prestigious appointment, and I was fortunate to land it after spending most of my twenties and thirties wallowing in sub-par collections.

I loved \u201c the find, \u201d the moment you turn over a seemingly lackluster cluster to discover any number of precious and impressive gems hidden just beneath the surface. I lived for those moments of discovery. \n \n The night I stumbled upon the Stone began like any other. I finished inspecting the Star of India, one of our most prized possessions, and headed down to the vault to resume my search for the next great exhibition. I planned to work through another one of the dozen crates from Montana, but something drew me toward the hastily labeled North Dakota box. I would have passed up on the rest of its contents \u2013 smaller, less impressive versions of gems we had sitting elsewhere in the vault \u2013 if the brilliant white light had not caught my attention. \n \n The Stone bathed the entire vault in its ethereal glow.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] When everyone turns 18 , they receive a pet which is figurative of their personality . You 're the first person to receive a dragon ...\n","story":"They gave me an egg. \n \n An *egg*. On my 18th birthday. \n \n I did not know how to react. My father just said `` hmm, that's odd.'' \n \n For the record, it was a big ass egg, about a foot high. The messengers came during the night and deposited the box on our doorstep. We found it in the morning. I thought it was just a normal package until I saw the card with my name on it. The card bore the High Castle's seal. I tore open the box, fearing whatever was inside would suffocate. And then I saw the egg. \n \n Underneath was a booklet entitled `` How to care for your new pet.'' Like some fucking user manual. I carried the box inside and spent a good while just staring at the egg. Was it an ostrich? I knew ostriches had really big eggs? But why not just give me a full grown one? I did n't mind an ostrich, although I had no fucking clue how it was supposed to reflect my personality. I gave up thinlking and opened the booklet. The first thing on it was `` Place the egg over heat, preferably a fire place.'' \n What? Are you kidding me? They want me to cook it? I went through the rest of the pages and it was mostly egg+heat=good. \n \n Maybe the High Castle was having a laugh. Maybe they picked a random name and said `` let's dump this egg on him, maybe have him cook it for us.'' Maybe my real pet is n't gon na be delivered until much later in the day, I thought. I sighed and rose, but, just for good measure, dumped the egg in the still hot fireplace. There was still that chance. \n \n Nothing else arrived that day. Before going to bed, I glanced out my window at the HIgh Castle. The High Castle sat on top of the highest mountain and was visible to everyone below. `` Fuck you,'' I whispered. It was a daily ritual. The people in the High Castle were treated as gods, and they sure as hell acted as if they were. They trampled on `` low'' people like ants. The only decent thing they did was not keeping the animals to themselves. I did n't know where the animals came from, but I knew the High Castle only acted as an intermediary, ensuring the right animal went to the right name. I gave the castle one last glare and went to bed. \n \n It was months before the egg gave any sign of hatching. I kept a fire going for it out of habit, not really expecting anything to actually come out. But, one morning as I was stoking the fire, I heard the soft crack, quickly followed by louder cracks. Soon, I could see something dark trying to poke out a hole. A claw? Do ostriches have claws? I rolled the egg out of the fireplace and helped the creature pick at the thick shell. The head came out first, and then something slimy and leathery. The thing had four limbs and a tail. It kind of looked like lizard except for the leathery thing draped on its body. I took a hesitant hand to it and pulled it up, and quickly dropped it back. Holy shit. There is no way this is real. *No way*. \n \n The creature gave a tiny sneeze and then spread its still slimy wings. It folded them back and shook itself, like some dog getting rid of water. The creature looked at me straight in the eye and gave a toothy yawn. I stared back at it, still chanting *holy shit* in my head. All of a sudden a picture of the High Castle came to my mind, sitting smug at the top of the mountain. And then I looked at the creatures' wings. It's going to be strong, I thought, strong enough to fly *that* high. \n \n I have never laughed so hard in my life.\n"}

The spacecraft had provided stunning images of the planet and incredible insights into the nature of its moons to the scientists beaming it commands back on Earth, yet despite its myriad sensory equipment it was still oblivious to what would undoubtedly be their greatest discovery to date. \n \n The sleek, black spaceship hunkered down to the pitted surface of one of the larger icy rocks drifting through the immense rings of the giant planet. A series of plates extended around it, like a metal skirt, hiding the faint glow of a low intensity laser as it bored into the rock's surface. The perfect blackness of the craft's surface glistened as minute atoms of atmosphere condensed to it as it matched the sub zero temperatures of its surroundings. \n \n Inside, Kigann watched the bright golden space probe drift overhead through the tinted windows of his ship with an almost pitying look. The thing was so damn *obvious*. He watched it for a little longer, before returning his attention to the rings themselves; it would n't do to become so distracted that he failed to see an impending collision, or something worse. Behind him, his two crewmates continued to make themselves busy with work. Or rather, one of them was, he corrected himself as another chuckle sounded from Ziivan. \n \n'Could you keep it down?'

He stopped dead, his eyes fixed on a point far off in the distance. He held his breath, not daring to make a sound as he studied the far edge of the rings intensely. \n \n'Kigaan?' asked Shaelin anxiously. \n \n'Kill the power.' He barked, turning and rapidly shutting down every console in the ship.'Now!' The others complied, the urgency in his voice silencing any questions they may have had. Within seconds, the entire ship was plunged into darkness and silence, the only light now coming through the window from the reflective surface of the gas giant. For a few minutes they sat in silence, not daring to make any noise. Then, just as Ziivan was getting ready to speak again, something dark darted past outside. Shaelin's hands flew to her mouth to suppress a scream. She knew what was coming. They all did. \n \n More and more small, dark shapes flew past. Then came the larger ones. Then the really big ones. An immense swarm of pitch black nightmares; their shapes hard to make out with their dark colours perfectly hiding them in the void, visible only when they passed in front of the planet. A pair of the smaller ones tumbled past, long, sickening appendages tangled around the form of the human's space probe. Light blue spots on their bodies lit up as wide, void-like mouths sucked at the machine. Kigaan could faintly see a faint stream of energy being sucked from it until one of the larger, ship sized creatures drifted over and engulfed the entire thing, the smaller ones scattering just in time. The crew felt as though ice was flowing through their veins as the creature seemed to turn straight towards them, blue lights flickering along its form as it chewed on the probe. After a few terrifying moments, it turned and rejoined the swarm, disappearing into the shadow of one of the immense leviathans at the heart of the swarm. \n \n It was about half an hour before the last of the swarm had drifted past, and another ten before any of them felt they could speak again. \n \n'They... they're heading f-for the human's world!' Shaelin said in a hoarse whisper,'We have to warn them! There must be something we can do?' \n \n'There's nothing me can do.' Kigaan snapped back in a whisper of his own.

It will continuously do this. The code will be placed not in just 12 facilities, but 300 world wide. Every 6 months the mutated codes will activate, selecting 12 facilities at random to shutdown. It will create chaos: disease, decrepit standards of living, panic, uncertainty, the unknown of where will be next, how can it be stopped, can it be stopped. It ca n't be stopped.

A bad, odd feeling coursed through me, but I did n't really feel that it was of concern to me. When the show ended, I was still wiping my eyes from the emotional tears that this \n Episode brought. So I went to sleep to calm the crying, looking around at my room. \n I had a bunch of the figures and posters for the show, along with other pop culture things I liked. \n \n I woke up in the morning the next day, going to get ready for school and throw on \n Something -- the DVRed episodes of The Walking Dead -- and I noticed they'd vanished. Gone kaput overnight. I was ready to curse at the cable company, when I could n't remember the character names like I used to. Did I imagine a show that was my favourite?! I was so angry at myself, cursing and shouting. One of my dreams was to work on the set or be in the show and I'd moved to Atlanta because of it, I heard my partner starting to wake up, her sleepy eyes glancing at me. `` Lydia? What's wrong? `` \n \n `` Nothing, Ainsley. I think I imagined liking the Walking Dead.'' I replied, wiping my eyes. I leaned and gave my girl a quick kiss on the lips. `` This sucks.'' I sighed. It was our mutual favourite -- why would it not exist anymore? We even lived in the county the show's county was based on... it was the biggest show on television too.'' \n \n Suddenly I heard a knock at the door, and I jumped. That was odd... we lived in a small town now. I grew up in Canada, in a town where there was a high crime rate. `` That must be the neighbour Andrea,'' Ainsley went to the door, and I swear to it, something was really odd here. \n \n `` Hi guys!'' I was shocked when I heard her voice.... for the show not to exist, the comics would have never existed..... then I saw her husband, who looked even more familiar...: these two had been characters! \n \n I pinched myself but it was real. I had now entered the world of my favourite tv show where it did n't exist. Where it did n't happen. Ainsley looked at me strange and shrugged it off. We did have a neighbour named Andrea, we did have a blended family that moved in with a baby daughter down the road. I decided to accept it and move on. This was better than watching the show anyways. I got my dream and I'm feeling fantastic about that happening! \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Memento mori - Remember , you will die .\n","story":"This is going to be extremely raw and personal and I'm not reading while I type, nor am I ever reading this comment again. I hope it means something to someone, anyway. \n \n I think from an early age, I used too look at my face and see nothing. I'd look at my hands, and my stomach, and my legs, and id see the verbal marks that my mother's sharp tongue etched into them. I'd look at my hair, because it's dark and curly and not like the other girls', or I'd look at my dark eyes and pale olive skin, and I'd see something different. My mother did n't like me, and my mother was my world, so I did n't like me either. \n \n Then it got worse. Before it was only her who was very verbal about her disdain for me. But it grew, and the other girls started to notice. Those looks turned to whispers, whispers turned to cruel words. Fat. Ugly. Dumb. Worthless. Those words.. So vital was it to me to be something different that I lost sight of everything else. \n \n I remember at first, drawing and painting. The palette knife, my canvas, my brush, they were my refuge. Then I remember the peace I used to get from art being replaced by anger at myself. `` My drawings are never good enough. They never will be.'' I gave up the palette knife opting instead for a knife to my wrist. The fingers I once used for beauty were nightly shoved down my throat. I may not be beautiful but my hands... My hands, with the skin bitten off from the sides of my fingers, my nails all but gone from anxiety, covered in cuts and scabs and bruises. My hands can create or destroy, such beautiful, morbid things. My hands have always been wondrous. Yet I was using them, tarnishing them in order to hurt myself. \n \n At the age of 9 I was taken to a specialist. `` She shows signs of disordered eating and body dysmorphia,'' he said. Those words, like labels being printed for a product, nothing to do with me. His teeth were straight and white and his breath smelled like sanitizer. I hated him. I sat there and plaited my hair, swinging my legs. I hated him. \n \n I had a friend in year 7 who was everything I aspired to be. She was thin and pretty and smart, and when she smiled the whole room lit up. Everyone followed her with bated breath, as if their breath would break her picture-like perfection. She broke down to me on the phone one time. `` I work so hard for everything,'' she told me. `` And he's still dead. Everyone always says'Oh, if he were alive, he'd be so proud of you.' But he is n't. I've worked for everything I have. And I'm still not happy.'' \n \n When I replied to her, the words were so simple, and made so much sense. `` So why do n't you change your attitude? Work hard for you. He'll be waiting for you at the end, so why do n't you enjoy the journey.'' \n \n Now, almost 8 years later, I've taken my advice. Everything I have, I've worked for. If I do n't have it, I have n't worked hard enough. When I look in the mirror, I still see someone not worth seeing on the outside, but on the inside I've shaped myself into so much more. This body is a vessel for my soul. I refuse to take medication; I refuse to blur my vision to my many imperfections. I do n't hate myself. I do n't love myself but I love the things I do. \n \n Death. The thought of death brings me nothing but peace. But the thought of a journey is always more tedious than one of a holiday. I'm going to keep pedalling towards my destination. I do n't know where I'm going or how I'm going to get there but I'm going to be at peace with every step.\n"}

I also passed a ruin of a mill, but the riverbed was cracked and full of bones. The wheel looked like it had n't turned in living memory. Somehow, Riverside hung on. Gangs of dirty children watched as I walked by, my spurs ringing with every step. A chicken crossed the road to get away from me. \n \n `` Hold her! Hold her!'' \n \n `` Careful, she's a wild one!'' \n \n The villagers had caught themselves a centaur. They'd bound her and hobbled her but she struggled and kicked. Or tried to kick. A villager scrabbled out of the way of her hind legs. \n \n `` Told you the pit trap was worth digging.'' \n \n `` Pit trap, hell. *I* wanted a new outhouse.'' \n \n She was muddy and bruised but better-fed than any of the humans. She had a head of chestnut hair to match the color of her horse half. \n \n `` What're *you* looking at?'' a villager demanded. \n \n I'd stopped without realizing. `` Just passing through,'' I said. \n \n `` Well, pass on straight outta here. Unless you'd like to make me an offer?'' \n \n `` I'm just looking for a hot meal.'' \n \n The villager spat. He was probably married to his mother. `` Inn's that way.'' \n \n * * * \n \n The inn was the largest building in the village. I'd seen bigger barns. \n A drunk asked to buy him a drink. \n \n `` Maybe later,'' I said. \n \n The day's special was thin stew and cottage loaf, both made by the innkeeper himself. He was a sullen old man and I hoped the food tasted better than he looked. \n \n `` What's this?'' he asked, when I tried to pay. \n \n `` That's an Imperial mark,'' I said. \n \n `` We're not in the Empire,'' he said. `` And I do n't take coins with that creature's image.'' \n \n `` It's solid silver.'' \n \n He grumbled, but eventually produced a set of scales. It took a depressing amount of silver shavings to pay for the meal. \n \n `` Got a drink for me?'' asked the drunk, after I'd sat down. \n \n I pushed a bottle his way and reached into my bag for my knife and spoon. \n \n `` You're not gon na take off your gloves?'' he asked. \n \n `` No,'' I said. \n \n `` You're not gon na take off your hood?'' \n \n `` No.'' \n \n He watched as I ate. The stew tasted sad, if that was possible. And the chicken bits were tough and bony. But it was hot and the bread was fresh. It took effort not to eat with my hands. \n \n The drunk had a gleam in his eye. `` Y'know, your hand looks funny.'' \n \n `` Old war wound,'' I said. Which was true. \n \n `` Do n't seem to bend right.'' \n \n `` Broke it, more than once,'' I said. \n \n `` C'n you buy me another drink?'' \n \n I looked at him. I was still wearing the hood, so he did n't back off. I reached for my belt and he leered. \n \n I put the Imperial mark, now smaller, on the table. Slowly I slid it to him. `` For your silence,'' I said. \n \n He took the coin and stumbled out of the inn. I finished my meal in peace. \n \n They were `` taming'' the horse-girl as I stepped out. They'd gotten an old saddle on her but nobody could stay on. So they were lashing her up and down the main street. \n \n `` Ha ha! That's it, beat it out of her!'' \n \n `` Make'er bounce!'' \n \n The centaur said nothing. They'd gagged her. All she could do was hobble and twist her back and shoulders away from the blows. She was naked from the waist and the whips cut angry lines into her skin. \n \n I burped. My tongue darted under my chin to get at a bit of chicken grease. For the first time in months I was pleasantly full. I wanted nothing more than a place to sit and light my pipe. \n \n The horse girl worked the gag from her mouth. `` Phr-please,'' she croaked. `` Please!'' \n \n *None of my business*, I thought. I turned to the other end of town. \n \n `` Please. H-help.'' \n \n She must have dropped her guard, because there was a *crack*. She screamed and her forelegs buckled. A villager had laid a blow across her upper back. \n \n `` Ai n't no stranger gon na help you,'' the man said. `` Not after I'm through with you. Eh?'' \n \n He looked up. I was in front of him. \n \n `` What do know about horses?'' I asked. \n \n `` Know enough to shoe'em,'' he said. His leather apron marked him as the local blacksmith. \n \n `` What will you do with this animal?'' I asked. `` From the looks of the saddle, nobody here knows how to ride.'' \n \n `` Dunno. Make her pull a cart? What's it to you?'' \n \n `` I'll buy her. I'm tired of walking.'' \n \n I patted my money pouch, which jangled pleasantly. The smith and the mother-grabber smiled. That's when the drunk reached behind me and pulled off my hood. \n \n They saw the missing ear. The receding hairline. The scar that split my upper lip and pointed to my right eye. \n \n `` His eye...'' \n \n My right eye had a horizontal pupil, like a goat's. \n \n `` Paladin!'' they screamed. `` He's a paladin!'' \n \n * * * \n \n `` You know, there was a time when people showed more respect.'' \n \n `` We do n't want your kind,'' the blacksmith said. `` Your god is dead.'' \n \n `` Yscyigg lives,'' I said. `` You think I'd still have this eye if He were dead?'' \n \n `` You'll bring the sickness!'' \n \n `` We did n't bring the sickness!'' I said. \n \n The innkeeper shouldered his way through the crowd. `` I should've known when he tried to pass off that heathen money.'' \n \n `` Did I eat for free?'' I said. `` Fine. I know when I'm not welcome.'' \n \n I scattered coins in the dirt. `` That's more than enough to pay for the animal. Now, if someone could cut her bonds --'' \n \n * * * \n \n I woke up with my face in the dirt. Someone had thrown a hammer at the back of my head. I rolled sideways. The blacksmith stomped, hit only the ground. I got to my feet and got my fists up. \n \n I would n't have been knocked out if I'd been wearing my helmet. But I'd thrown it away because it was too distinctive. Dizziness and regret washed over me. \n \n The blacksmith charged, swinging another hammer. I threw him to the ground. Mother-grabber came in low with a knife and I caught his wrist and forced him to the ground. I had enough room now -- out came the arming sword. The innkeeper had a mace. No time to parry, I took it on the arm defenses. Steel hit steel. \n \n More regrets. That mace might've glanced off if I had n't painted my armor. Plate should be slick and shiny, the better to deflect blows. But I'd painted my pauldrons black to keep the rust off. A fugitive with no squire has no time to polish metal. \n \n I parried and sidestepped. Needed to keep the mob in front of me. Needed to tangle up their weapons too. I crouched and jabbed. A pitchfork stabbed toward me and almost wrenched my sword away. \n \n I raised my free hand, then remembered that my god was n't listening. Pity. I used to be able to summon tentacles out of shadow, to liquefy the earth and bury my enemies alive. I used to be able to boil people's blood, or turn their eyeballs into spiders. Not anymore. \n \n I twisted and the bottle shattered on my back. Shards of glass tangled in my hair. I shoved the drunk against the wall and punched him. \n \n I'd kept the left gauntlet and was glad for it. The first punch broke his nose. The second punch smeared it over his face and shattered an eyesocket. The third punch caved in a cheekbone. \n \n Pain! I fell to one knee. A child had cut me in the leg. He giggled and came in for another stab. \n \n `` Bwaaagh!'' I said, sticking my tongue out. He screamed. He'd never seen a tongue with suckers before. I got to my feet and slapped him aside. \n \n The whole village was out. Not one of them had any love for Yscyigg, because they were all armed. \n \n `` Heretics,'' I said. `` Damn *all* of you!'' \n \n I threw myself at them. The innkeeper swung his mace and I chopped his hand off. The villager with the knife thrust low and I stabbed him in the neck. Probably in front of his mother. The blacksmith roared and swung a hammer at my skull. I dodged and he punched me in the gut. \n \n Endless regrets. I'd traded my good cuirass for a leather gambeson. Like my helmet, the breastplate had marked me as a paladin. \n \n I retched. Someone slipped on the vomit and I ran him through the back. Blood ran down my leg. I was getting dizzier. `` Damn *all* you heretics!'' I said. \n \n They came at me, all of them. Even the chickens, or so I remember. A woodcutter attacked and I killed him. His wife attacked and I killed her. A dog leaped at my neck and my sword went all the way down his throat. The innkeeper jumped on my back and tried to strangle me with the stump of one arm. I threw him off and opened his belly. \n \n I killed and killed but kept taking hits. \n \n An arrow went *thunk* into my chest. I looked down and my chest sprouted another arrow. \n \n `` That was a tactical error,'' I told the archer. As I ran him through I said, `` That's not where my heart is.'' \n \n The blacksmith threw a hammer. It would've clipped my ear, if I still had an ear. \n \n `` Fuckin' *fall down*, you!'' He said. I grinned. He swung but I was ready. I lunged, slashed. His leather apron split and he fell to his knees and gave birth to his own intestines. \n \n Still the villagers came. A boy with a peg leg walked in, fists swinging. I tripped him and stepped on the leg, breaking it. A villager with a cow skull for a helmet swung a halberd at me. I stumbled back, bleeding. If I was to die here, I would do so with an honor guard. \n \n I raised my hand and called, not upon Yscyigg, but upon my own reserves of strength. At once, every wooden thing began to burn. The inn exploded. The hovels collapsed. The old mill imploded and the wheel rolled down the riverbed. \n \n I heard screaming. Well, everyone was screaming. But the centaur was still bound, unable to run. I crawled to her, and with the last of my strength I severed her hobble. Then I blacked out. \n \n * * *\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] It is the summer after seventh grade . Write a love letter to the girl\/guy you crushed on during the school year .\n","story":"Dear Adri, \n \n This letter comes from a friend you had *and still have*. Sorry if the placement of this letter might have freaked you out as if it could have been some ransom note, heh. I PROMISE IT IS NOT. Just... read ahead, pls? \n \n I know that you're not going to be in school for the last few days before summer vacation, and well it seems pretty clear that I might not really... ever see or talk with you ever again, so I decided that I would write to you this letter in the effort to communicate how much importance I realized you had in helping me; and well, I want to mention other things too. \n Okay. *breathes then exhales ~~and then contemplates if writing down my physical actions were necessary.......meh~~* \n \n Firstly, this letter comes to you from Juan and is not intended to be a straightforward love letter, heck, or even a love letter at all, but I do still think and have thought that you were always ~~hot~~ pretty. So, I repeat, this is from Juan- you know, the guy who sat across from you half the year and never dove into any deeper conversation than, `` Hey,'' every now and again? I know that we talked a bit whenever we had to do a group assignment together with the rest of the table but rarely did I ever get to speak with you alone about something not related to school. This is where I have regret. It was only until you told Alyssa that you were leaving before school ended that I realized how much I wanted to spend time with you. \n \n Every other boy in our grade is always glorifying some supposed `` pretty girl'' and then moving onto the next one out of bordeom in some fantasy-fueled cycle of `` getting with them.'' I observed that this happened so much so that I became disgusted with the idea, but not only with them, but in the end, myself. I guess what I am trying to say is that I thought and still think that you are pretty and are destined to be a really beautiful woman one day. This thought however made me hate myself because I ultimately became one of those boys I hated by having these fantasies of you just standing there beside me as a statuesque vanity piece for however long I remained interested in you. Ugh... Now, what I really want to say is that I do n't want you to only be that pretty girl devoid of your human element. I noticed that you're smart, have dreams of traveling, are good at math, love piano, and are just a human I wish I could spend time with. ( Plus, you killed that advanced algebra test everyone else had trouble with. ) This is why I am writing this letter, so that you not only know what I thought about you, but to help me remember what I learned from you. \n \n But wait, girls are humans? Why I never... Yeah, this idea is stupid, but I guess this idea was me until I met you, but anyways... You're presence, or maybe inevitable lack of it, had me become really motivated because I figured that since you had all these goals ahead of you ( and were destined for great things, ) it made me want to be as successful as you might become. With the aid of this success I plan on one day meeting you along the lines towards your goals. Moreover, when I meet you I want be proud that I matched my ideal that you helped set. \n \n Heck, even writing this was an accomplishment for me, and I'm sure that this will help me become successful! I did n't even think of writing this letter until I got a text from my dad saying that I had to go buy 2 % milk. Not that you remind me of 2 % milk, but as I was wating in line at the store the combination of overpriced ice cream and overly time-consuming old people at the register just happened to spark inspiration. We can like, write things down on paper instead of typing words onto bright rectangles! I'm slow on these simple things so bear with me... \n \n Lastly, I want to say that I kind of love you but I think that saying *love* would trivialize the word *love* because it used too often to describe something really vague no one ever seems to question the validity of. Nawmsayin? So, let's say this then, In conclusion, if love existed on a continuum, for that stretch of continuum I would rate myself as loving you at the 40 % mark. This would mean that I adore you for the person you are and I hope will become- something great or decent? I do n't know. I guess I'll try my best and you'll do whatever you want for you. \n \n Meet you halfway, \n Juan\n"}

Well, shit. \n \n I knew immediately I was in for it when the guy walked in, and instead of seeing his face I saw twenty different faces of people I knew.

At this point, getting robbed was part of the job. \n \n `` Money in the bag, asshole!'' He violently threw a plastic bag at me.

His gun arm was drifting off somewhere to the left, to my relief. He continued. \n \n `` You know how much it fucking sucks, to have this shit going on with your face *all* the time?

What does that mean!'' \n Death rolled his eyes again. `` Convicted. Sentenced. Tried... You follow me yet''? \n Son tapped his brain, as if to better the connection between the two of them. He rolled continuously through the darkness. `` I'm scared I just do n't follow you.'' \n Death was through with rolling his eyes. He slammed his fist down on his desk. `` Listen hear, buddy. First of all, it's `` afraid'', not `` scared'', you illiterate pig. Secondly, in your most recent language of... What did you call it?'' Death leaned over to rifle through his files. `` This will just take a second.'' He muttered in an annoyed tone.'' \n Son did n't care about a second. He had been waiting countless seconds. Millions. Billions. He could wait, he thought. He smiled. \n `` Firstly, stop smiling. Secondly, in your most recent language of Niosivt, convicted means `` Abjjerakt''.'' \n `` Abjjerakt.'' Son muttered, nodding to himself slowly. He quickly stopped, as the movement caused him to violently spin out of control. Or at least it would have, had he had anything to orient himself to. \n `` Why do you keep calling yourself son?'' Death asked, curiosity getting the better of him. That's why he had taken the job. Damn Mercury. He had made the job sound so good, just when he had gotten into Heaven. \n `` Son?'' Son gave the equivalent of a space laugh, his throat choking silently in the vacuum in which he lie. \n `` It's lay, you idiot.'' Death muttered to himself, almost absentmindedly. He knew almost every book in the world. He made it is goal to get to know the people he would take. \n `` Wait.'' Son thought for a good hard 3 minutes and 45.76 seconds. The suspense was clearly killing Death. \n `` You want to know how I knew you thought using incorrect grammar? Well let me tell you something, I've been able to hear every single grammar mistake you've ever made since the age of 1, you idiot.'' \n Son was shocked. `` You were with me... The whole time?'' \n Death had had enough of the stupid questioning. `` Yes, yes. You are here-by convicted, or *Abjjerakt*, of resisting Death, myself, and your punishment is to die. Quite ironic, if you ask me. And you'd better. I wrote the word.'' Death hoped that Son would accept in fear, and not ask the gaping question which lay. \n But the countless billions of years had not dulled Son's senses. His IQ, in fact, had risen to the point that he had reached the same conclusion Einstein did using only himself in space. `` Wait just one minute here! Death ca n't do that! Death can only collect dead people, you ca n't kill them!'' \n Death sighed. `` See, Edwa... Son. The truth is, you are guilty of the crime, but I ca n't do anything. I want to go now. You think that the years have been harsh on you? Do n't answer that... I know that they have. I can hear EVERY DAMN THING YOU SAY, or think. I've been around since the beginning. The damn beginning. I was with the first race of life to exist in this universe. In fact, I was the first life to die. So, God in his ironic ways decided to make me the judiciary of death. I've been around for 17,800,003,341 years, 11 months, 13 days, 3 hours, 4 minutes, and 2.45 seconds. And for that time I could hear every thought of every life, everywhere. And the results are in. The last life just went and died, over in the Andromeda. If you are quite damn well finished with your time here, Lucifer's twisted idea of a joke ( he never did like me, I never sided with him in the Schism ). I'd like to seal off this Universe, if I may. That's the kind of work I'm in. A plague is sweeping through the Universe to the up and right of here. I'd quite like to leap into that. Right now, I ca n't take their lives, and they are suffering.'' \n \n \n Black. Black up, black down. Black to the right. Or what looked like the right. Son could n't even begin to process what this new friend in the dark had said. Well, he could, but he did n't want to. But even in all of this confusion, one question prevailed. Pesky human instinct, always taking over. It always made it so difficult for me to kill humans when they were being chased by all manner of creatures. `` What will happen to me? I've quite figured out by now that Heaven and Hell exist, from you speaking, but where will I go?'' \n \n \n Death sighed. But he could n't lie. A little fail safe God, in his infinite ironic ways, had put into him. `` Well, in your time on Earth, you were quite the bad person. Sodomizing, thinking about murder, making your poor mother so sad.'' \n \n \n His mother. Son had n't thought about her in... A long, long time. `` I'd quite like to see her.'' He muttered, almost absentmindedly. \n \n \n `` Well she was a good person! Donated her time, money, and love to the needy; including you! She's in heaven!'' But Death wanted to finish this up. He wanted to see him mother also. \n \n \n `` But I'll give you a little deal.'' 17,800,003,341 years, 11 months, 13 days, 3 hours, 7 minutes, and 16.33 seconds is a long time to wait, and Death did n't think he could wait a second more. `` You agree to go now, and I take you to heaven, no questions asked. I'll seek you into it somehow. I ca n't lie. I just want to go now.'' \n \n \n Death and Son uttered in unison. `` Yes. That sounds quite nice. I'd quite like to go home about now.'' \n \n \n \n \n \n **Edit 1: Sorry about the big block of text. I do n't know how to fix it! **\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Major prison sentences have become a choice between two pills . One just kills you . The other , well no one knows what that one does ...\n","story":"Two guards escorted me into a small room, lighting askew and chairs dimly placed. A man with white suspenders and a white hat sat across from me. His hands were folded in an elegant manner, the type of way a wealthy person would greet a peasant in a handshake. A small oak box laid in the middle of the table no bigger than a paperback copy of Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. The man's stare had meaning; not superficial meaning such as that of an actor, but true meaning. The man stared at me with intent. Intent to know. An intent to investigate. From what I could discern, this man was a detective. \n \n `` The handcuffs were to your specifications, Mr. Singer?'' The guards removed my bindings. The man in white spoke in rhythmic tones, a soothing and sharp crescendo of vowels and consonants. I certainly was n't his first customer who requested a specific adjustment to my shackles. It was n't my fault I was born with weak wrists. Or perhaps maybe it was. \n \n `` A bit restrictive,'' I rolled my wrists in a slow motion, `` but so is my budget.'' I set my hands on the table, mirroring the man in white's divinity. \n \n `` And you kept your budget close to your wallet, such as handcuffs, yes?'' The man in white pulled a thick manila file from his briefcase set on his left. The briefcase had a five digit combination lock with letters, as opposed to traditional numbers, to secure the case. It started with'A' but I could not read the other four. The man in white thumbed through the folder, licking his thumb between pages. \n \n `` I've already been interrogated enough. Forgive my rude demeanor, but I'm not here to answer your questions, I'm here to receive punishment.'' I stretched my neck. I hoped my punishment would be a nice warm bed to sleep on. The slabs I rested on these past few years have certainly taken their toll. \n \n `` Who said anything of punishment? Certainly you can agree this is merely another chapter to be written in the book of Gary Singer.'' The man in white closed the manila folder with a smile. My name was written in the tab. \n \n `` Another chapter, ha. If my life were a book I would burn it for eternity for its drivel and lack of conflict. I've made my mistakes, but none certainly greater than the lack of risks that have passed me by.'' I sat forward, crossing my fingers. \n \n `` I take it you're not a gambling man.'' The man in white lightly caressed the oak box, drawing attention away from his gaze. He failed to entice me. \n \n `` I tend to stay away from games in which I am not favored.'' I stared into the man's shoulder, admiring the quality of his shirt. \n \n `` Good! Then your choice has already been made for you,'' The man opened the box, revealing a thick velvet the color of pure ivory lacing the inside of the vestibule. Two pills laid bare on a raised platform in the middle, identical in size and color. I assumed this was the choice that has been made for me. \n \n `` And what choice would that be?'' My brow furrowed. \n \n `` I'm not here to answer questions, Mr. Singer, I'm here to deal punishment,'' the man in white smirked in jest. I sat back annoyed. \n \n `` Let's not play games. Why is it that I am here? What do you have for me?'' \n \n `` I have nothing for you, except a choice. I have been sent to deliver a message. And you know why you are here.'' \n \n `` And what is this message? Your ambiguity is unappreciated.'' I crossed my arms and hoped to die was the truth of the matter. Living in solitude was not an issue. Being confined in a small room was not an issue. The issue was a lack of choice, of freedom and control. I no longer held the strings, and the marionette had been passed around so many times between the Federal Government and the very privatized prisons I once governed that I thought about grabbing both pills and shoving them down this man's throat so I could feel once again what is was like to be in a position of authority. The man in white stood up, and began pacing around the table. \n \n `` My message, Mr. Singer, is meant to be vague. Throughout life we are presented opportunities. Opportunities to grow, to invest, to escape. Yet we are unable to see the outcome of these opportunities at the time they flourish, so we are merely asked to make a decision and project the outcome based on our choice,'' The man in white stood behind me, his hand met my shoulder. I stiffened my posture. `` You Mr. Singer, in your words, have failed to take risks in your life. I would argue that there are no risks, merely opportunities refused in favor of a more desirable outcome.'' \n \n I glanced up at the man in white. `` So what? These pills are a representation of how I'm to end my life?'' \n \n `` Or begin it,'' the man leaned against the table to face me, `` it's your choice.'' \n \n `` Begin it in what sense? It sends me into a hallucinogenic coma while I suffer on life support for my remaining days?'' This man was easy to read. \n \n `` Could be.'' \n \n `` Or perhaps it creates some sort of disease, such as Alzheimer's, or Dementia, and I'm to be sent to the psych ward for further processing,'' I half pried to receive an answer. Not that it would change my decision. I had made up my mind. \n \n `` This is what you've been so good at over the years, Gary, analyzing the outcome of decisions and going with the most definite,'' the man in white glanced at the box, `` so here's the definite. The pill on the left will kill you. You will die in peace, and live the rest of your days in a coffin six feet under. You will sacrifice your memories and in return be granted a stable state of rest. Your life will no longer live on, all that remains will be your legacy. That, is the definite.'' \n \n My legacy had been destroyed by the prosecuting attorney when he presented the final piece of planted evidence that put me here. No one would remember cautious, intelligent, millionaire Gary Singer, no. The general populace merely knows only embezzling, fractured, prisoner Gary Singer. The thought disgusted me. I picked up the pill on the left, rolling it between my fingers. `` And the pill on the right?'' \n \n `` You're a predictable man, Mr. Singer, you wo n't choose the pill on the right.'' \n \n `` You said it yourself, I weigh decisions based on the lesser of two evils. I ca n't hold up to your predictable reputation if I do not know each evil.'' I licked the pill in my hand. It tasted like salt. \n \n `` Some say, the pill on the right is life's re-do button. Others say it's a prolonged death sentence.'' The man in white spoke with a factual tone, as if each of these scenarios were possible and he held no favor toward which was more correct. I placed the pill in my hand back in the box. \n \n `` And what do you say.'' \n \n `` I say life is what you make of it,'' the man in white lifted his thigh onto the table, grabbed the pill on the right and placed the pill in my palm, `` it is n't every day you get a second chance.'' \n \n I stared into my hand. I remembered the days of old when I ate lobster with a hefty side of liquid butter. Clich\u00e9, I know, but all my life I was clich\u00e9. Born into a rich family, living a lavish lifestyle through my teens and twenties, attending merger meetings in my early thirties, and acquiring enough assets in my forties to buy all the hungry children in the world a three course meal every day for the remainder of their years. I could n't imagine a more gifted life. Or a more boring one. \n \n `` I'm not one to seek second chances,'' I popped the pill into my mouth, savoring the succulence of South African Lobster tail with a hefty side of liquid butter, `` but I'm sick of being predictable.'' I swallowed. \n \n Rolling up his sleeves, the man in white rose from the table, `` it's rare that you surprise me, Gary Singer, but I do admit this is one of those times.'' the man in white jockeyed his suspenders from his shoulders as he grabbed the manila file with my name on the tab and slid it back into his briefcase. He closed the small oak box, and slid his chair into the table. He eyed me up and down, his posture ready to leave. I stayed seated. \n \n `` Before you go, I have to ask,'' I sat back arms crossed, `` who are you?'' A tingling sensation coursed itself through my limbs, to my chest, and finally my neck and skull. \n \n `` As I said before. I am a messenger.'' The man in white, now with a much more casual demeanor, tapped the locking mechanism on his briefcase. The letters had been scrambled into nonsense. My vision was starting to become blurry, a darkness circling my line of sight and closing in at a slow, breathing pace. \n \n `` Well, yes,'' words were becoming harder to pronounce efficiently, `` but for whom?'' \n \n `` You know for whom,'' the man in white walked toward the door. Before exiting, he turned one last time to face me. `` Goodbye Mr. Singer. I look forward to speaking with you again. Good luck on your journey.'' \n \n `` I do n't believe in l-lu-lu-'' my face began feeling as if it were melting, `` luck.'' My memories were fading, and I could n't place where I was or why I was there. I felt an immense sense of dread, my hands shook, and my legs were paralyzed. \n \n `` Nor do I, Gary. It's just one of those laws that seems to only matter when it's not on your side.'' The man in white exited. I could n't hear the door close.\n"}

Odd to have the night you were murdered coincide with a kid \u2019 s movie. Being a member of the dead ain \u2019 t so bad. At the time I was fiending for rocks and my sire killing me sort of cured it. Funny, at the time, he just wanted a big Negro to be his muscle, for me, it was a way out. \n \n Usually, when they turn ya, you are schooled and broken of bad habits like an ornery horse for a decade or so but my master needed my services immediately. It helped I was big and could use a piece. It was much more helpful that I was not scared shitless in a firefight. \n \n So after 2 weeks of being a vampire I was ordered to ride with Reginald Tipton to meet the Reagent of the Indiana Territory. We met at the Government Building in downtown Indianapolis, near monument circle. Old vampires, for some reason, have a hard on for monuments and government buildings. So I was dressed in a Macy \u2019 s suit, given a strap, and told to keep my damned mouth shut. Being a vampire was almost the same as being a new member of a street gang, except more drama. \n So about 50 of us were in the council chambers in the Indianapolis government building waiting for the reagent to show up and talk at us. I thought I was at some opera or something because everyone was in some dumbass outfit with a cape. One lady even had those tiny binoculars. \n \n At midnight, some little guy walks out in a tiny red coat with a powdered wig walks into the room and calls out to us like we are in court. \u201c Please rise for the Honorable Annabelle Louise Maycott, Reagent of the Indiana Territory and Heir to the Maycott Dynasty\u2026 \u201d \n \n I think he rattled off some more titles but I quit listening when this tiny girl walked into the room. She was barely 5 foot, barely a woman, and had the attention of everybody. I could not keep myself from looking at her. I think everybody was staring because she was in charge. Me? I could not stop staring at her ridiculous Police sunglasses. Girl came in shorter than my 12 year old niece, wearing some Shakespeare looking dress, wearing giant-ass mirrored sunglasses like she couldn \u2019 t decide whether she was in Romeo and Juliette or Hawaii Five-O. \n \n But like a good little colored-boy I kept my damned mouth shut and didn \u2019 t let a snicker out. Shit like that would get you shot especially if it involves a tiny white girl. After she sits down people talk at her about various crap. Who owes who what and what territory goes to whom. It was like a bunch of dealers arguing about corners with a bunch of pimps. \n \n After about an hour of people bickering, the Reagent says \u201c bring me the newly dead. \u201d \n \n If Reginald Tipton was alive he would have died from shock. From what I understood we were just there to be seen, like at a party where you aren \u2019 t part of the cool people, but you want to be a cool person, so you show up so people associate you with cool folks. Like that. Dude starts shaking like my grandma and tries to drag me up to the Reagent. He must have been too scared because I ended up dragging him half-way there. \n \n Because of here silly ass sunglasses I couldn \u2019 t tell what she was looking at but Reginald was inspecting his kicks and I was looking at her eyewear. \n \n She finally spoke again. \u201c Is this your blood? \u201d \n \n \u201c Y-yes Reagent. \u201d \n \n \u201c Child is there something you want to say? \u201d \n \n There are times when you need to keep your mouth shut. When the absolute worst thing you can do is speak. This was one of those times, and of course, I didn \u2019 t. \n \n \u201c Yeah, why the hell are you wearing those goofy ass sunglasses? \u201d \n \n It was like Winter showed up for a minute in the building. Room got cold and people stood real still. \n \n \u201c Let me show you. \u201d She took off those sunglasses real gentle and placed them in front of her. \n \n Now let me tell you a couple things. I have seen some shit and been through some shit. I had a nigger put a gun to my head while his friend shoved his hand up my ass looking for my stash. I have had my pops smash a bottle over my dog when I was kid and threaten to cut us both up. I have been pulled over on the Southside of Indy at 2 A.M. by drunk cop who hates black people. \n \n So when I say that seeing that thing with her sunglasses off was scariest fucking shit I have ever seen in my whole life, death, and in between you know I mean business. What I saw, I mean there was nothing. Nothing-nothing, like everything that had ever happened to me was pointless and everything I would ever do didn \u2019 t count and I was here on a whim and would cease to be in the same way. \n \n As it turns out there was nothing behind her sunglasses. And I saw more in that nothing than I have ever seen since. \n \n\n"}

There was no mistaking that voice. Lord Tyren had the most recognizable voice in game. But as the current end boss, he should be sitting on his throne in Westfire Fortress. What in the Angel's name is he doing in Sprigsprocket?? \n \n `` I am looking,'' Lord Tyren started slowly, emphasizing each word with a heavy step that shook the ground, `` for an imbecile quest giver named Jinxy Whistlespout.'' \n \n His statement ended with gritted teeth and barely concealed rage. Jinxy's pale green skin turned almost white, and she backed up against a wall, terror and confusion making her want to run, but knowing she's stuck in this 5 foot radius. \n \n She heard mumbling outside and the word `` tavern'', then the door slammed open so hard that it cracked the wall. \n \n `` YOU!'' The angry Lord pointed a massive finger at Jinxy. The stories did no justice to the great beast of a man standing in front of her now, intimidating and glorious in his power. \n \n `` M-m-m-e-e?'' stuttered Jinxy, her pointed ears flattening against her head nervously. \n \n `` You are the bastard idiot of a quest giver who stole my throne?'' Tyren roared. \n \n `` I-I-I- do n't know what you're t-talking about...'' \n \n Lord Tyren pulled a long scroll from inside his fiery gold armor, and strode across the dingy room. His head almost scraped the domed ceiling. Jinxy cowered under his rage. He was at least 3 times her height - not to mention 100 times her rank. \n \n He shoved the scroll at Jinxy and she took it fearfully, already knowing and dreading what it would say. \n \n The Quest for the Golden Throne ~ Level 18 ~ COMPLETE \n \n Jinxy gasped. `` He completed it??'' \n \n `` So you admit it!'' Lord Tyron's fist slammed into the table, breaking it in half. Jinxy shuddered. \n \n `` I... I mean... I did n't think... how did a Level 18 break into your throne room and steal Indomitable??'' \n \n `` Just! - What! -'' Tyren sputtered. `` How dare you! It does n't matter how he did it! All I know is a Level 18 NOOB is sitting on MY throne, swinging Indomitable back and forth like it's a plaything, and, and... giggling!'' \n \n It was probably the heightened state of fear, but Jinxy let out a giggle of her own. She never imagined the Lord of the entire Kingdom saying the word `` giggle''. \n \n Lord Tyren's eyes bulged out of his head. `` Do you know what you've done, small elf? You have broken the lore. As we speak, teams of raiders in freshly purchased gear and stocked up on potions are headed toward the Fortress - MY Fortress - expecting to meet and be defeated by ME.'' \n \n He took a quaking breath. Jinxy doubted it was quaking in fear like hers was. \n \n `` Instead, they will find a fresh-from-the-swamp noob elfling with cheesy combat dialogue.'' \n \n Jinxy scratched her ear and screwed up her face. `` Well, if it helps, the first person to walk in there will probably defeat him in half a second.'' \n \n `` YOU FOOL'' Lord Tyren boomed. `` Do you think I prefer a Level 100 raid geared player on my throne?!'' \n \n Jinxy shook violently. `` Then perhaps you can go defeat him first?'' \n \n Tyren spoke slowly now, as if worried Jinxy was slow in the head. `` I am bound to the lore, same as everyone else. It is only your type who have the power to direct change. Besides, he wields Indomitable. I can not simply waltz into the Fortress. He is ruler of the Kingdom, and the guards will protect him as so.'' \n \n `` You could... post in town chat and form a group to raid the Fortress?'' \n \n Tyren was silent. The nearby NPC's muttered and shuffled uncomfortably, avoiding eye contact with Jinxy. \n \n `` So,'' began Tyren, `` you want the Lord of the Kingdom - sorry, former Lord - to post a message in chat. Let's see, how would I phrase that?'Geared ex-Lord LFG Golden Throne Heroic'? Do you have any idea how fast the online forums will blow up?!'' \n \n Jinxy's legs gave out and she slumped to the floor. `` I'm... so sorry. I'm an idiot. I was bored, and this really green elf came along chattering about his'great journey' and saying'Vengeance will be mine!' and I just... wanted to have some fun...'' \n \n She became aware that she was babbling in front of the most powerful man in the land, someone who could pick her up in one hand and snap her neck. She fell silent. \n \n `` Well that's just great, is n't it? We can let them know on the forums that the quest giver was'bored' and taking liberties, shall we?'' Lord Tyren turned to leave. \n \n `` Wait!'' cried Jinxy, bounding to her feet. `` Wait! I could.. I could give you the same quest, and you could sneak into the throne room and reclaim Indomitable and your title!'' \n \n Tyren turned, and narrowed his eyes. \n \n `` I suppose...'' he stroked at his beard distractedly as he thought. `` How would I get in? The guards are no longer loyal to me.'' \n \n `` How did the elfling get in?'' asked Jinxy. \n \n `` He... err... disguised himself as a concubine and seduced one of the guards.'' \n \n An awkward silence blanketed the village. \n \n `` Well,'' Jinxy said after a very pregnant pause. `` We could... get you some... robes? And maybe shave the beard...'' \n \n Lord Tyren roared with a raw bestial rage that tore through the Kingdom, and somewhere in the distance, the soft, taunting laugh of a barely-man-elf echoed back.\n"}

I walked down the sidewalk and down a flight of stairs. I was in the New York Subway Station. \n \n I purchased a ticket and walked to the boarding platform. It was dark in the tunnels and the people around me were still as hopeless as they had always been. It seemed like there was no holy touch here... \n \n until a bright light appeared down the tracks. The glow caught my attention. No one else seemed to notice it. They just carried on with their lives as if this was an every day occurrence. The light kept getting brighter and brighter the longer I stared at it. \n \n I had to get a closer look. Did I just discover God? Is He really so pure that He has a heavenly glow? \n \n I jumped down onto the tracks and began to walk towards the glow. I was about to discover the truth. My ears filled with loud sounds. My face was blessed with a gentle breeze that grew stronger and stronger the closer I walked toward the light. And then the holiness hit me full on. \n \n My body felt like it was ripped off its own feet. I felt an incredible rush of wind and all of the noise became silent. It was bliss. The light disappeared for a second as everything went black. \n \n All of my pain and worries left my body. God must have wanted me to be completely at ease when I met Him. I sat up and opened my eyes. There before me stood God Himself. \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A world immaculately frozen in time is discovered .\n","story":"Derrick was leaning back in his chair, left hand lazily draped over the controls and his eyes scanning the display with a burning boredom. It was near the end of his shift and he could n't think of anything but sleep. \n \n His eyes began to glaze over and his vision began to blur when a small signal caught his eyes. He straightened a bit and looked closer. \n \n `` This does n't make any sense,'' mumbled Derrick as he read the scan results of Bd-435. He turned around to the ship's navigator: `` John, take a look at this.'' \n \n John's eyes did their habitual scanning over meaningless numbers before acting as though they discovered the answer themselves, widening in surprise as they glanced over the final column labelled `` Classification''. \n \n John let his white eyebrows crease for a moment. `` Double-check the sensors-'' \n \n `` Already done it.'' Derrick's mood was puzzlingly cheerful. `` Did a couple diagnostics and there's absolutely nothing wrong with the system.'' His face softened and looked a right decade younger. \n \n John's chipped and cut face cracked as he felt a smile growing on his face, too. `` Keep on confirming this result and run some more tests on this mass. I'll start writing the report to send to brass.'' The team plopped into their chairs and set to work like it was their first day in the corps all over again. \n ___ \n Captain Ampint of the U.F.E. *Beyond* was feeling the best he had felt since he was first assigned the mission to head the first mobile telescope exploration mission. He had first thought it would be a role full of danger and tough calls, but it did n't take a long time for him to adjust to the routine, boring nature of confirming already known results. \n \n This time though, was different. Their classification system had for the first time ever identified something anomalous. Ampint could n't help but feel a slight ticklish light-headedness about the first interesting thing to happen in his career. \n \n It seemed at first like an everyday, run of the mill black hole. But when the computer scanned the edges for some readings on it's Hawking radiation, it found that its event horizon was far too large; a whole light-year across. Its mass was nowhere near enough to justify that, and when the computer was confused, interesting things happened. \n \n The ship had changed course for the first time just a few days ago, warping spacetime to get to the edge of the object as quickly as humanly possible. Ampint could feel the hair on his neck rising ever so slightly in conjunction with the charged atmosphere of the command center. He watched the representation of the ship blink ever closer to its destination in orbit around the object and could n't help but bounce on the balls of his feet slightly. \n \n ___ \n \n John did n't even turn around this time. He pressed the intercom button that went directly to Cpt. Ampint's personal earpiece and whispered with trembling lips: `` Sir... you're going to want to see this.'' \n \n It took less than a minute for every officer and every tech and the ships' janitor to crowd into the data processing room. John had never felt so important in his life as when he transferred his images onto the big screen. \n \n He pointed at the screen and made the first speech of his life, finger trembling gently, clearing a line of sight through the suffocating lack of space. `` As you all... can see... nothing in this system is moving.'' He gulped. `` But the thing is... it should be moving.'' He shuddered and took a deep breath. `` The whole system is... frozen. Frozen in time.'' \n \n The air was too precious to waste with breath. Cpt. Ampint waited a full, pregnant five seconds before he said: `` If every wave of quantum foam is frozen in there, how can we see anything at all?'' \n \n It was clear this was the part Derrick was worried about. He shifted uncomfortably in his clothing. `` You see, every scope just sees a black sphere where the system is. But our transmitter is getting an... image.'' \n \n No more pauses. Heart attacks were imminent. `` Well, what is it?'' the captain commanded. \n \n When Derrick had first seen the image a thousand thoughts had run through his head. What kind of sorcery, what kind of science, what kind of cruel god had created that system? Who or what had that kind of power over space? Where were they now? Why did they do this? \n \n Derrick was terrified, his eyes welling as he tapped the next output onto the display. A thousand images filled the screen, flashes of emotion documenting an alien and terrifying concept that struck close to the hearts of everyone in the room. \n \n Warning. \n \n Alarm. \n \n Disease. \n \n Miasma. \n \n Evil. \n \n Death. \n \n *Quarantine. * \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The story of a man gaining superpowers and realizing he must use them for good ... at the age of 50 .\n","story":"Tom was excited as he felt the wind blowing through his hair at top speed. This is what he was looking for all this time. The satisfaction he felt missing from his life while he blew out his candles last week. Fifty years old does n't mean anything. It certainly does n't mean that he ca n't enjoy life anymore, and he's definitely enjoying life with a brand new red convertible. \n \n Tom had always lived so safely. He never even joined the football team in fear of a few scratches. Chess and glee had been much safer. No more, though, Tom had decided. His life was almost over, and there was still so much to explore, to experience. Tom was n't going to let another 50 years roll by without some excitement. \n \n With such a dull life, however, Tom had never driven such a fast car at such fast speeds. He ignored this fact as he drove fast around corners in the open hillside. Tom ignored the sign cautioning a modest 40 miles per hour around the next bend. He began feeling the control of the car losing him as he compensated by slowly moving into the next lane. His heart beating fast, but a smile on his face. What Tom did n't see was the other car making its way in the opposite direction. \n \n Tom did n't know what happened next. He never even saw the other car coming. Tom only remembered waking up several yards from his car. His car along with another, totaled. Without thinking, Tom gets up and rushes over. In the other car lay a battered and bruised kid. Someone in their 20s. The kid was motionless and bloody. Tom just knew the worst must have happened. \n \n Weeks had gone by. Tom still remembers what happened, how he got out without a scratch while some innocent kid had his life taken from him. Tom even went to the funeral, although he did n't tell anyone how he knew the deceased. No charges were pressed, but he almost wished they had been. He did n't deserve to be the one to walk away after being so reckless. \n \n Shortly after the funeral, while his wife was asleep, Tom snuck into his basement. An old gun in his hand, a revolver. It was passed down by his grandfather. A single bullet in his hand. Tom sat down, took a good look at the gun, and loaded the bullet in. He was n't sure if he wanted to die. He even began doubting if he deserved to die, as he had been feel the last few weeks. An uneasy tear rolled down his cheek as he spun the barrel of the gun. The clicking of the gun came to a slow crawl before stopping. Every single click echoing in the poorly lit basement. \n \n Tom's hand shaking, he slowly held the gun to his temple. Questioning if he really wanted to do this, he began remembering there was just one bullet. Just one chance. Perhaps he'll pull the trigger, nothing will happen, and he'll walk away. Forget anything ever happened, and that fate chose for him to stay alive. Tom's shaking began to worsen before he decided to just pull the trigger. \n \n Tom woke up to screams from his wife. She was holding onto him, asking him if everything was alright. She had heard the gunshot, and came downstairs to find Tom laying on the floor beside a gun. Tom was still in a haze as he touched the side of his head where the gun had been. He felt some burned hair around the area, but no hole. Looking at his hand afterward, there was no blood, either. Tom hugged his wife, appreciating his life much more than he had ever before. He told his wife that he had set off the gun by accident without realizing there was a bullet inside. \n \n Tom had realized something amazing that night. The question that had been bothering him for so long. Why had he lived, and someone else died? Tom performed a few more experiments, just to be sure. He had become certain, though, that he could not be hurt. Nothing scratched him, hurt him, or even broke his bones. He had survived, because all along, he was special. \n \n Tom decided that he owed the young child something in return for his mistake. The child's death, after all, was caused by Tom trying to find reason and excitement in his life. In Tom's misguided journey to fulfill some sense of purpose, he had taken a life. It was time that he made up for this, and did good with his newfound abilities. Late at night, when his wife was asleep, he would sneak off and become an avenger for the people. Stopping criminals taking advantage of the good. This is how Tom made amends.\n"}

Snow hashes down in diagonals relative to the straight, upward and upward lines of the buildings which stretch down Peachtree like monoliths. \n \n It's warm and well-lit in this corner diner. A few, very few people. And I switched to night shift because of this. To avoid people and sickness. Particularly the ulf. \n \n Ulf season is going to be prevalent this winter, according to the blogs and talking heads. Religious groups presaging the second coming.

I remember when it started. As it spread outward from the southwest-Asian jungle hells, the nascent terror it carried bestowed itself upon the people wholesale. Everybody in the western world regarded their televisions, bemused, as scenes of unadulterated joy played out on the news. Villagers hugging each other and sharing food. Asian businessmen giving fortunes to charity. Surely the illness would spread to North America, and then what next? \n \n The news agencies would invariably end their reports by saying, \u201c - although scientists report that the disease does not appear to be killing anybody. \u201d \n \n Which was n't entirely true. The week before the ulf hit the U.S., reports were coming in from Japan of businessmen committing suicide after having given away all of their possessions. Lunging from skyscrapers. Hanging from branches in verdant forests. And similar stories from other countries. \n \n It divided the nation, according to the news who all day had gray men arguing back and forth as to whether such a disease was to be feared or welcomed. \n \n \u201c Maybe, \u201d a Catholic priest said on one show, \u201c this is the second coming of Christ and his loving spirit has divided to enter us all. \u201d The man with whom he was arguing, who used words like'index funds' and'anti-capitalist' rolled his eyes and raised his hands, exasperated. \n \n But when it hit, it hit hard. Everybody was laughing and smiling. People gave things away, and sometimes fortunes. In one case, a former billionaire who'd had the ulf for two weeks tried to sue to reclaim his money. It was deemed impossible, as the people to whom he gave the money in turn gave the money away. \n \n A morning show host was placed on paid suspension when she smilingly announced the tragic, lion-related death of a famous young singer. \n \n From then on, it was agreed that somber news should be delivered only by healthy reporters. Although it did n't help watching a fast-food restaurant full of people erupt into laughter as news broke of a woman who, in a fit of ulf, gave her toddler child to an estranged family member who killed the toddler. When I saw that, I returned to work and asked my boss for a transfer to night shift. He happily agreed. \n \n \n I've been working night shift for seven years now. \n \n \n I admit that, as far as epidemics go, it is n't a bad one. For the most part, people come around. But, to me, there is something sinister about people being so nice that they destroy themselves in a mania. \n \n I look up. The woman three booths down from me smiles and waves.

It was the neon lights of a hotel sign. Thank God, just what I needed \n \n There she stood in the doorway, the pretty but stern looking receptionist. The interior was old fashioned and eerie. It made me uneasy, but I could n't help admire the photogenic craftsmanship. Such meticulous detail, such obsessive perfection. I thought to myself, `` This could be heaven or this could be hell''. \n \n As I grew drowsier, I decided I needed a room. We made the transaction and she took out a box of matches and a half melted candle. She struck the match and lit up the drooping candle. She led me down the quiet hallway, the candle illuminating the dimly lit corridor. As I was lead to my room in my sleepy state, I could've sworn I heard voices. They were whispering `` Welcome to the Hotel California, such a lovely place. Such a lovely place.'' \n \n As soon as I entered my room, I flopped onto my bed, limp with exhaustion. My head sank into my pillow and I drifted off into a deep, deep sleep. There was no dreaming that night, just dark, black unconsciousness. \n \n I awoke hours later, covers strewn about. There was a head shaped circle of sweat on my soft, plump pillow. It was still dark. I strolled about the room, looking for my shoes. I did n't remember taking them off. I searched under the covers, only to find them tucked neatly under the dresser beside the bed. \n \n I traveled out of the room and sauntered down the dimly lit corridor. I heard those voices again. Now that I was more alert, I could hear them more clearly. They were coming out of the other rooms, the sounded creepy. Not malevolent exactly, but more melancholy. `` Plenty of room at the Hotel California. Anytime of year, you can find it here.'' \n \n I got to the end of the hallway and noticed the large window overlooking a courtyard across the lobby. I looked through it and saw her, in her Mercedes Benz. She pulled into the courtyard full of her pretty, pretty'friends'. They all started to dance. They danced through the wee hours of the morning. Some looked as though they wanted to remember, others to forget. \n \n I went to the bar next, asked for some wine. He told me that spirit was n't sold there since 1969. I walked again past the hallway, again hearing them whisper. `` Such a lovely place. Such a lovely face''. \n \n I looked around. Neither the barman nor anyone outside seems to notice or care about the voices. I tiptoed carefully past all the rooms to see if I could hear them clearer. `` They livin' it up at the Hotel California. What a nice surprise. Bring your alibis.'' \n \n Thoroughly freaked out, I left the corridor filled with such haunting voices, and jogged over to a set of double white doors on the other side of the lobby and rushed through them.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Time speeds and slows like weather . A town is trying to evacuate before the biggest slow front on record .\n","story":"Along the coast of British Columbia sits a secluded town called Youngsville. This town, named after the founder John Young, sits exactly 300 kilometres from one of the largest anomalies recorded. The Alaskan Tear. This is just one of many holes in time to pop up over the years due to an increase use of time travel. These holes occasionally emit waves of strange energies that slow, or in some cases speed up, local time. \n \n This can become a problem as an extreme slow in the timestream can cause bodily functions to cease. Sure, while our hearts may beat slower during a minor time disruption, a full scale 6 time disruption can stop them completely. A scale 6 has only ever occurred twice in modern history. Once in Japan where the entire island nation was frozen for ten years. Once time returned to normal anyone who had been frozen collapsed. Many died from the sudden shock of returning to normal time. Those that did n't lost their minds to what is now called `` Timeturners disease''. Modern day Japan is a glorified asylum now as China and neighbouring countries had no way to deal with the swaths of time-damaged people. \n \n Due to this, the town of Youngsville, BC, Canada has been issued official orders to evacuate. \n \n ******************************************************************* \n Youngsville, 2024 \n \n `` All citizens are ordered to evacuate.'' The news was saying. So were the police too, they were going door-to-door asking people to please evacuate the streets and move down the coast or out to Prince George. Anywhere was good, so long as they were out of the way when the wave came. Teachers at school always talked about it. \n `` The big one was coming,'' they'd say, `` any day we could have a repeat of Japan only it'd be you.'' The school board tried to prepare them too, teaching them evacuation routes and how to remain safe after `` The Big Freeze''. There really was no way to prepare. Time waves were n't like an earthquake where you crawled under your desk, or a fire where you simply walked outside. Time was dangerous in the sense that one minute could be tapping your foot impatiently waiting for the final bell and the next your foot is frozen millimetres from the next beat and there you stay for god knows how long. Then, your foot slams down on the floor with the force of 50 years and your heart is hammering in your chest and you ca n't breathe and *Oh God the hunger*. \n \n Adrian pushed those thoughts from his head and finished packing. He zipped up the suitcase and stood up pondering if he should take the picture of him and his father hanging over his bed. He was eight, his father in his mid 30's and already greying around the temples. They sat smiling on a beach somewhere. *Cuba? * Adrian thought, most likely not. His family was a family of travelers and they had been all over the world. Thirteen years ago they had been a week from boarding a flight to japan before, well, you know. \n \n `` You ready bud?'' his father appeared in the doorway, his face with more wrinkles and his hair almost snow white. On his shoulder was a duffel bag, a few hockey sticks sticking out of it. \n \n `` Yeah lets get out of here.'' Adrian said with a sigh rolling his bag behind his father. As they walked through the living room he could n't help but feel a churning in his stomach. Usually before a trip it always felt weird saying goodbye to a place you knew, even if you would only be back weeks later. But with the wave coming, Adrian felt worse at the unease, not knowing when or if he would return. His eyes absorbed every detail in the house and he, knowing full well that should he return everything would be the exact same, without dust or decay. \n \n He closed the door behind him; the feeling dissipating. Time distortions were already present, bird chirps slowed down and sped up and walking down the front steps felt like walking through mud before he practically teleported to the car. His body felt stretched and his head hurt to think that yesterday these things might've felt normal to him..He opened the door and his mom, sitting in the front behind the wheel, said something before her lips moved. \n \n `` The news is saying these are only the warning signs, things will get back to normal before getting worse.'' \n \n `` Great,'' his dad said, closing the door behind him but the thump sounded seconds after. `` Can we please get out of here.'' The speeding up of his last few words were almost comical and Adrian would've laughed had it been any other day. The car sped down the road and eventually they reached the outskirts. Time disruptions became less common and less severe the more hours they put between them and Youngsville. You could see some people who had taken to walking.

I was so smart, why should I want to be'just a librarian'. I shook my head and told them they would n't understand, although perhaps I just did n't want to explain it. \n \n Even if I had n't been sent back in time almost seven hundred years as a result of a physics experiment gone either perfectly or massively awry, my work still would have mattered, because there's no such thing as'just a librarian'. \n \n I am more than a mere keeper of books. I am a Master of Information without peer. I've run programs teaching people about subjects ranging from Middle English history to modern farming techniques, to cartography. \n \n So, when I arrived in fourteenth century England ( and I knew where I was and when I was based on the local flora and the talk of war over an English king claiming the French throne ), I was prepared. \n \n In many ways, I was better prepared than any of my highly specialized friends. \n \n My ex-girlfriend Michele, who went on to be a fairly accomplished surgeon could probably stitch a wound far better than I could ever hope to. But I doubt she knew how to make stitches from catgut or silk, as I did. \n \n My former roommate, Alex the mechanical engineer, could probably make machines with tolerances well beyond my own, but could he teach people who to refine iron into stainless steel? \n \n Could any of them speak enough medieval Latin to communicate? I doubted it, even among my own profession that was an obscure skill that I was mocked for learning. Joke's on them, I guess. \n \n So, with a spring in a step and a gleam of ambition in my eye, I headed to the coast to find a ship to the mainland. I would have to earn money along the way, but being a literate person, I could pass for a wondering priest and collect alms. \n \n I would need something that I could pass off as a bible as I preached to people, but that would n't be too difficult. Some scraps of leather and a cloth would fool most people. \n \n Once I reached the mainland, I would head for Rome and establish myself as a part of the Catholic church. I would have to turn the Roman Catholic Church into a monotechnocracy, declare the Avignon popes heretics and excommunicate them, and set myself up as a dictator, but that should n't be too difficult. It was n't like the church was n't headed for another Great Schism anyway. \n \n The Black Death was coming up, but that was nothing a few good lessons in hygiene, quarantine, and the early invention of the chlorine bath could n't stop in its tracks. \n \n On that subject, it would probably be a good idea to kickstart chemistry entirely and introduce the periodic table a few centuries in advance. \n \n In order to explain all my strange knowledge, I would have to claim to be a new Messiah sent by God at some point, and dodge the inevitable assassination attempts, but a little biological warfare in the form of plague infested blankets in the right houses, followed by claims that God had sent the pox as punishment for their heresy against me, his new prophet, would probably head off the worst of that. \n \n Then it's just a matter of writing down enough that my successor, whoever he or she might be, knows what to look out for. \n \n Like global warming. If the industrial revolution happened fast enough, followed by a rapid conversion to nuclear power, that problem might be prevented entirely, though that was far enough in the future that I was n't too concerned about it. \n \n Right now, I just had to remember my history. \n \n After all, I was making it.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] War breaks out between the legions of hell and heaven , humanity joins and surprisingly is winning against both\n","story":"Humanity had made the galaxy their home. Whole planets were sent out to other galaxies, to settle the ones with no advanced life, and to make contact with other species. \n \n A few intelligent life forms had been found across the inhabited. Most too primitive to be useful, but all of them lots to learn from, scientifically. \n \n A curious finding was that the systems with intelligent beings all had similar folklore as humans - comparable gods, similar myths, and so on. \n \n Also, no life form was found to ever have gotten completely destroyed by an impact or other catastrophic event after intelligence had emerged. While traces of primitive life forms were quite common in systems that had been ravaged by such events. \n \n Apparently, there was an old race of aliens for which we were something like a big petri dish. They were visiting us, they did certain stunts with us which might be something like intelligence tests, and they pretty much shelved us in the last hundred thousand years. \n \n Years in which humanity had advanced exponentially, dropping their human bodies a long time ago for artificial bodies, which, by now, had become as big as planets. \n \n Some of the humans decided to secretly investigate ways to find a path out of this petri dish. They set up surveillance in the whole known universe, they probed the limits of physics to find ways out, and so on. \n \n Their break-through came when one of those aliens tried to have a look at Earth - not finding it where it used to be, as humanity played with planets now the way they used to play billiard. Automated defense system had quickly overwhelmed the visitor, which was actually nothing but a simple probe, and quite primitive, actually. \n \n The visit left some curious physical and chemical traces, from which humanity found a way to penetrate the border between the worlds. The remains of the probe also allowed some ideas how those aliens worked - apparently, their universe was 4-dimensional, so humans learned to think and see 4-dimensional - even if that meant little in their 3-dimensional world. \n \n A large scale breakout was planned, with humans from across the whole galaxy and even some outposts from the nearest galactic neighbors being involved. One alien race, which was nearly as advanced as humanity, also took part. \n \n The technological difficulties were enormous - it was basically of a program running on a computer to manipulate the area around the computer to produce something with which it could see and move. Because we were all just a simulation on an advanced alien server. \n \n When humans and their allies broke out, they found themselves, despite planet size, as small as bacteria are for humans. As they had already figured, they were in a storage area in a closed lab. They could now analyse the things they found in the lab, they could improve their simple bodies, which, being 3-dimensional with minor 4-dimensional adaptions, were rather inadequate for this world - like a paper figure trying to stand up. \n \n Unseen by the aliens, the break-outs managed to analyse the lab. They managed to break into their computer systems, even their codes, and quickly got an overview of the whole alien world - which was 4-dimensional, but less than a light-year to travel in any of the 8 directions. \n \n The simulation with humanity got an upgrade ( like whole planets made of rare and valuable resources, but also a path to 4-dimensionality and closing the distances in the universe with that ), and a direct connection to the alien world to make it easier for more humans to break out - and go back. \n \n Humanity also stole some technology from the more successful experiments of the aliens. And they sent probes into some of the other experiments, using them as a hiding ground in case they were caught, and settling in unused galaxies or equivalent structures in them. \n \n The stories about heaven and hell were also found out to originate in two factions of aliens - one wanting to equip experimental simulated life forms with know-how and power, to make the simulations develop faster, and the other preferring to only watch as god-like judges, destroying failed experiments at a whim, and indoctrinating them with their world-view instead of knowledge. Apparently, leaving the subjects to choose which way to go was part of their play and ethics. \n \n Using equipment in the lab, the break-outs quickly took over not only the simulation servers, but also other computers. They hid in corners or in unassuming equipment. And they managed to find ways out of the lab, exploring the whole planet. \n \n In several remote regions on the planet, they set up outposts. Advanced humans came about, which did not have the physical limitation to planet size - their bodies, like the bodies of the aliens, now were big enough to allow a complexity as that of billions of planetary sized humans. And unlike the aliens, who had become complacent at some point billions of years ago, they kept learning, improving, and getting better than those aliens. \n \n The original simulation of the universe of humanity had become distributed to several servers, now mostly human made, but with fall back options to the original servers in case the humans were successfully driven from the alien planet. \n \n Also, piggy-backing on alien space ships, humanity had spread to all of the universe of the aliens. \n \n Eventually, one of the humans still in the lab, when just emerging from one of the simulation servers, was caught by the aliens. A big quarrel erupted between the two factions of aliens. Eventually, they decided to destroy the simulations. \n \n When they came for the servers, even though humanity's simulation was pretty safe, humans decided to keep them from doing this - out of respect of the countless other simulated beings. \n \n So a war started. One unprepared alien after another died - with illustrious names like Wedin, Thurr, O'tin, Ethina, She'vo, and even their boss, billions of years old, A'Ra, among the victims. Humanity quickly took over the home planet of the aliens, and many uninhabited smaller planets and moons. And then negotiated a peace with the remaining aliens.\n"}

I had just sold my share of MotiSight and decided to hitch a ride with a bus full of cultists. They were on their way to Peru -- probably to jump off Machu Picchu or something -- but they were nice people and had some amazing drugs. The United States and Mexico were pretty much a wavy gravy blur of acid and shrooms. \n \n But yeah, when we got to Belize, I said good-bye to the cultists and spent a few weeks on the beach sobering up and diving the great blue hole.'' \n \n Cobus smirked, `` Oh, is that where you got all the practice?'' \n \n `` You know it, you pig. Anyway. Tanning and SCUBA got boring --'' \n \n `` Your life is so full of first world problems. If your life were any tougher, you'd have to stop for a pumpkin spice latte right now.'' \n \n `` Oh shut it. I worked hard for that. Military brats are only privileged when their parents are officers. Besides, you benefit quite nicely from my first world problems. \n \n Like I was saying -- I was ready to move on from Belize and so I came down here to Guatemala. I spent a few days exploring Tikal -- you know: Yavin IV -- and on the last day, there was a large group of indigenous Mayans performing a ritual. \n \n I stayed and watched, and when they were done, I approached some of them to find out more. They were so warm, and eager to share their culture. They invited me back to their village, and you know I'm loathe to disappoint people. \n \n It was amazing. Simple, concrete and hatch buildings. Dirt paths and long grass over rolling hills. Chickens, cows, and pigs. Children running around. Far out of cell phone coverage, not computer in sight. One TV for the whole village to watch movies once a week or so. Only two or three of the buildings even had a lightbulb. \n \n I ca n't say I found myself there, or some deeper contentment. It was amazing, and I enjoyed it, but it scared me. I enjoyed it as a retreat from the modern world -- but there was always the knowledge of returning to creature comforts we know. \n \n I helped some where I could: I tore apart one of my flashlights and wired the LEDs up so my host family could have light in their home without a generator. But, the whole time I was there, I kept trying to fix things that did n't need fixing. I played them samples of new music and translated a few episodes of Seinfeld for them -- neither was a big hit. I mean, the things I did were nice enough, but they were the ones who showed true understanding that we were from different worlds. \n \n Like the Catholics and the Evangelicals before, I could n't understand that they did n't need my modern thinking. Their concerns were getting potable water, and teaching their children enough to go to University in the City, and hoping the government did n't come again to kill them all. These people lived like this always, for generations past, and likely for many in the future. \n \n I was young, self-centered, and restless then. Now, I hear Thoreau calling me from some cabin by a swimming hole with a waterfall. So let us continue on our march. I believe we are n't too much further.'' \n \n The sun spilled its golden light across the countryside from its position nearly touching the hills. Armin and Cobus continued to hike imperceptibly upwards. The trees thinned and gave way to fields that rippled and shimmered in the wind. Sitting on the hilltops, clusters of buildings looked like diminutive hats strapped with little brown roads to heads of luscious green hair. \n \n `` We are almost there. One or two more hills and we should come to the village proper.'' \n \n continued in reply..\n"}

Just behind the Sprite cans. No way around it. \n \n `` Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.'' \n \n Reluctant and unsure why on Earth he was doing it, he grabbed the toe by the edges. A little note was dangling out of it, like a holiday card. \n \n It was an address and a date and time. \n \n \n \n ___ \n \n \n \n Marta was thinking about yoga and Daryl's penis when she found the eyeballs. They were behind a couple of old \n Twix bars, and she screamed and ran to the bathroom, like the eyes might suddenly go after her. \n \n When a little bit of sanity kicked back in, she went back to the machine, and she, too saw the address and the date and time. \n \n ____ \n \n \n \n `` Martin, I'm telling you, she can tell me and Javier apart.

Marta asks now, as the people all gather around in her living room. It's tiny, and a lot of folks are standing, and there was n't orange juice for everyone. Then again, \n everyone's holding a limb and a note with an address and a date, so no orange juice is ranking pretty low on the \n scale of fucked up things in the evening. \n \n `` I do'', the blonde lady states, raising a shy hand holding a pinky toe. \n \n `` And we got all the parts here?'' \n \n `` Yeah. I think the guy with the left ball could n't make it, but he mailed the ball'', a dude says, from the corner. \n \n `` Ok\u2026 So\u2026 Ok, ok, ok\u2026 I'm as lost as all of you, here.

The blonde lady approaches with needle and thread. `` Can I\u2026?'' \n \n `` Yeah'', Marta says. `` Yeah, I'll help.'' \n \n One by one, people start joining in, and pretty soon everyone's sewing a piece of human body to another. After a \n bit of discussion as to which ball was the left and which one was the right ( the final consensus being that the left \n one was the smaller, for reasons that remained unclear for Marta ), they finally get one toe away from ready. \n \n Stanley steps up with the toe. `` So we're really sewing this dead body together?'' \n \n `` Look, man'', Henrique joins in, `` I think it's messed up like you do. But someone \u2013 something \u2013 brought us here \n together. This is deep stuff man, and creepy stuff. I say we just do as the notes told us to do. Is n't that what we \n agreed?'' \n \n Everyone nods and there's a slight murmur of approval. Stanley, reluctant, plucks the toe together with the other \n toes. \n \n `` All right, give me the thread.'' \n \n And he sews. Marta and Henrique and Martin and all the other watch as Stanley goes up and down the toe of the \n highly deformed, highly disproportional cadaver they built. \n \n Just before the last turn, Stanley stops the needle. `` All right, this is it'', he says, and then he gives the thread the final turn. Careful, he grabs the scissors and cuts the loose bit. The body is ready. \n \n It looks exactly like you'd imagine Jon Bon Jovi would look like, if he had spent seven hundred years inside a \n functioning washing machine. \n \n The cadaver opens his eyes and everyone goes, `` Oh''. \n \n He looks around and rises to his feet. `` You sewed me back to life, like the prophecy'', he utters, in a low and high \n pitched voice at the same time. \n \n `` Yeah\u2026 Yeah, we did'', Henrique answers.

The Palace itself was stunning, curtains of the finest silk, stunning artwork on every wall, even the pillars were gilded and shined. The road here had taken the lives of my brothers, my sisters, and my right leg. Every painful step I took now on the makeshift wooden leg was a reminder of each loss I had suffered. \n \n I motioned my guards to leave the room, leaving the door open behind me in case I needed their help. Armosii looked up. He was dressed in a simple outfit made of regular cloth, his battle armor still hung up on the wall. He was n't a frail man by any stretch of the imagination, but his skin sagged lightly around his face and his hair was thin and graying. \n \n `` I'm not armed, there are no traps, you've nothing to fear.'' \n \n I kept my sword drawn, and pulled up an old wooden stool and sat down. \n \n `` Armosii, your guards have all been slain. The Western Kingdoms swear loyalty to me at the price of your head. I do n't have to tell you what happens next.'' \n \n He nodded, and poured himself a cup of water. \n \n `` Jidon, I will not resist or struggle, so long as you listen and let me drink this final cup of water.'' \n \n I nodded, while I had no love for Armosii I did respect the man who had united the entire world under his oppressive rule and felt he deserved a last wish. Armosii tossed me one of the books from his desk. \n \n `` Have you ever heard of this book?'' \n \n I looked over the old tome in my hands, it's title read *The Grand Conquest of Ilosh*. \n \n `` No, Armosii. I have not.'' \n \n He tossed over three other books, all of them old and slightly decaying. None of them were familiar, written on the front of the oldest of them I could n't even recognize the characters. \n \n `` Most of those books were written long before either of us, or our Father's were born. And each of them tells the story of a person like us, who have gained immeasurable power through adversity. Each of those books is about a man or a woman who dealt with unspeakable brutality and loss to achieve greatness. You can read about every victory, every defeat, every villain slain and innocent spared.'' \n \n Armosii looked into the water in his cup and started gently sobbing again. \n \n `` Each of these books shares in common that their hero had to, at the end of their journey, make one last kill to save mankind. One demon always stands in the way of peace.'' \n \n Armosii knelt on the ground. \n \n `` The books always end there. Always. When the next book starts, the hero from the last book is the villain of the next. ALL of them thought they could be the ones to bring peace, and justice to the world. All of them. All of them...'' \n \n His voice tapered off into whispers as he closed his eyes. \n \n `` Armosii, finish your drink'' \n \n He snapped out of his trance, and a shaky hand made for his cup. \n \n `` My Father had every copy of *The Grand Conquest of Ilosh* burned when he took the throne. He could n't have that kind of heroic narrative in our world about the Mad Queen, he could n't allow people to know how she had risen.

The other man frowned, then held up a hand. \u201c Whatever. \u201d \n \n Evans got out of the car and straightened his jacket and tie before walking around to the front of the building. He didn \u2019 t care if Foster followed or not. Senior man called the shots, and he \u2019 d spent too many years shooting where told by *his* seniors to even consider giving up the privilege now that he was in charge. \n \n The bell above the door dinged as he pushed through. As usual, there were no open places at any of the tables packed into the seating area. And a line a dozen people deep snaked along the counter toward the register. \n \n \u201c Special Agent Evans, \u201d a small, mousey looking man said as he came through the flap that divided the counter. It thumped behind him against the rubber stoppers, ignored by both men as Evans held his hand out. \u201c How are you today? \u201d \n \n \u201c Frankie, looks like you \u2019 re doing well. \u201d \n \n \u201c Seems so. Still nosing around hoping to catch me being bad? \u201d \n \n Evans resisted the urge to scowl. \u201c We both know this is a game you \u2019 re playing. \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s no game, \u201d Frankie said, gesturing around. \u201c Why do you think they \u2019 re all coming? \u201d \n \n \u201c They don \u2019 t know you like I do. \u201d \n \n \u201c You eat my food too. \u201d \n \n \u201c Investigation, not consumption. \u201d \n \n Frankie grinned like a little kid. \u201c But you still keep eating it, yeah? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yeah Frankie, I eat the food, \u201d Evans admitted reluctantly. \n \n \u201c For you, I \u2019 ll make something special. You still like sausage and peppers? \u201d \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ve only got half an hour. And it doesn \u2019 t look like there \u2019 s anywhere to sit. \u201d \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t worry about that, \u201d Frankie said dismissively. He turned and gestured toward a guy, almost a kid judging by the patchiness of his beard, who was approaching the counter flap with an empty bus tub. \u201c Johnny, when a table opens up, put my good friend here at it. Him and his partner. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sure thing Mr. Butler. \u201d \n \n Evans watched as Frankie lifted the counter flap so Johnny could pass through, then went into the kitchen and nudged his way in between a couple of other employees at one of the prep counter. His expression was professional, but inwardly he was starting to wonder. Three months now, and for the last two it had been like this every day. The first month had been while word of mouth spread through the surrounding blocks, and now there were even people starting to come from further afield. \n \n If it was a prank, or a cover, it was among the best he \u2019 d ever heard of. And he \u2019 d heard of a lot. Including the travel agency that had operated for nearly five years and even won awards for customer service and industry excellence \u2026 all while bringing powder and bricks back on every flight. This though \u2026 the only reason he didn \u2019 t have a full surveillance op running was he couldn \u2019 t convince his SAC what the exact angle was. It had taken him calling in a couple of favors to even have some taps set up to watch the pizzeria \u2019 s bank accounts for unusual activity. \n \n Which there wasn \u2019 t. Everything was completely aboveboard as far as anyone could tell. \n \n But he knew. He just *knew* this was a sham. \n \n \u201c Agent Evans? \u201d \n \n Turning, Evans saw Johnny wiping down an empty table with a cloth. He threaded his way through the other patrons, busy scarfing down slices and pies, and sat down. \n \n \u201c You want coffee? Or is today a Pepsi day for you? \u201d \n \n Evans frowned very slightly at Johnny, searching the kid \u2019 s expression for any sign of humor. But he just looked ready to take the order. Frankie didn \u2019 t offer waitresses, and Johnny was only the bus boy. But Evans was in a special category. \u201c Coffee, \u201d he said. \n \n \u201c Make that two, \u201d Foster said, dropping into the other chair. The tables were small; to discourage loitering as much as to provide the maximum amount of eatery real estate. \n \n \u201c Two coffees, \u201d Johnny said, picking up his bus tub and heading for the front counter. \n \n Evans ignored Foster, who responded by pretending to be interested in looking through notes from the morning \u2019 s interviews on his phone. While his junior played the polite and respectful card semi-decently, Evans looked around. Trying to place the faces he saw. Some were regulars, but that wasn \u2019 t unusual. \n \n Every restaurant in the city, hell every *food cart* in the city, had regulars or they \u2019 d be closed. He \u2019 d run license plates, he \u2019 d run credit card numbers gathered from shoulder surfing, he \u2019 d run names garnered from some casual interviews in the first week, and every single one was legit. Perfectly ordinary New Yorkers. \n \n A couple with minor criminal incidents in their past, one guy who \u2019 d done ten years for aggravated assault, and another who had actually been busted for drug running; but no one seemed active. They were all clean, reformed citizens now. And the rest had apparently *always* been normal. \n \n Every employee was clean, to a man and woman. Nothing worse than parking and speeding tickets. Not even any DUIs. None of them with any citizen or immigration or tax troubles. He was certain Frankie had hired a completely clean staff for his benefit. Which was the right move if Frankie actually was serious about this pizza thing; Evans would have jumped on any excuse to come down on him. \n \n Coffee was there in less than a minute, and Frankie was back in ten. He brought a small pizza scattered with crumbled sausage, sliced red and yellow peppers, and a generous helping of extras. Chopped basil leaves, some finely diced mushroom, and what he suspected was a bit of spinach. \u201c Here you go fellas, \u201d he said, sliding the pan into the middle of the table and wedging a pair of white paper plates in on the corners near each man. \n \n \u201c That smells amazing, \u201d Foster said, reaching immediately for a slice. He yanked it off and onto his plate in one quick motion, then sucked quickly on his fingers to cool them off. \u201c Hot though. \u201d He accepted the napkins Frankie offered him, wiping the hot grease off. \n \n \u201c Frankie, you know my offer \u2019 s still open, \u201d Evans said. \u201c But if you keep wasting my time like this, I \u2019 ll rescind it. \u201d \n \n \u201c There \u2019 s nothing to find because I \u2019 ve got nothing to hide, \u201d Frankie said with a shrug. \u201c Just what you see. You \u2019 re welcome to look through the kitchen and store rooms again. \u201d \n \n \u201c No one walks away from the Bonannos to start a pizzeria. \u201d \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s the past. You \u2019 ve got nothing on me, because I \u2019 m not doing anything. This is my future. \u201d \n \n \u201c Bullshit. \u201d \n \n Frankie finally frowned. \u201c Special Agent Evans. I have customers. Language, please. \u201d \n \n \u201c Frankie, I can protect you. If you \u2019 re serious about this, \u201d Evans said, waving his hand at the pan on the table, \u201c then I \u2019 ll make sure the Marshals set you up with a joint wherever they settle you down. You can cook all you want. After you testify. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t need protection, because I \u2019 m not running. So there \u2019 s no need to hide. New York \u2019 s my town, and I \u2019 m not leaving. \u201d \n \n \u201c Frankie\u2014 \u201d \n \n The small man shook his head. \u201c I like you Evans, but don \u2019 t push me. I \u2019 d hate to have start filing harassment complaints. Enjoy the pie. \u201d \n \n Evans watched as Frankie made his way back to the kitchen, stopping several times to shake hands and ask other diners how they liked their lunches. \n \n \u201c There \u2019 s no way that guy is playing you, \u201d Foster said. \n \n Turning, Evans fixed the rookie with a sharp look. For once, Foster didn \u2019 t shrink from the steely-eyed gaze the veteran agent shot at him. He just folded the slice he \u2019 d pulled off to his plate lengthwise and took a bite, returning Evans \u2019 study with a calm expression. \n \n \u201c What, with your six months of experience, makes you say that? \u201d \n \n \u201c No one who can make a slice this good is hiding anything except the recipe for the sauce, \u201d Foster shrugged. \u201c And that \u2019 s the one question he won \u2019 t answer, right? \u201d \n \n \u201c Shut up, \u201d Evans said, reaching for a slice of his own. \n\n"}

One sat and the other stood. \n \n Beyond them was an uneven thicket of dry looking green pine trees, blocking off the half-grown sunflowers and weeds from traveling further than nature wanted them. \n Behind them was more miles of dry pines and weeds and bushes, and some dirt far beyond, leading to nowhere that was good in particular. \n \n The only things that had n't melded with the face of nature were a homely four-by-four and a hole in the ground that the two figures had been staring at for some time. As they sat, the wind pulled air through and around them, but they still were silent. \n Some seconds after the breeze broke, the one sitting solemnly with his legs crossed decided to speak. \n \n `` So what, in God's name, happened to my boy?'' The grizzled mouth on him spoke, the worn creases in his face shifting. `` Christopher Smith, where in the fuck is my baby boy?'' His body language was still while he posed the question. \n \n The other man, not quite middle aged, had his eyes wide open, dead set at the hole in the ground. \n \n `` I hoped at first he'd be with this man over here, but not after... That. God... God, I know he ca n't be with him.'' \n \n In the hole was a body. The dead body of a man, but the most notable features of that dead body were that his face did n't go beyond the nose, and his legs were buckshot below the knees. His tattered, white clothes fit with him, five feet in the grave. \n \n `` He took them all, pappa. But I did n't see nothin' like this on the horizon.'' The son looked back down to his feet and sat. He did n't know what to say for a few seconds before he looked back at his father. He continued on, \n \n `` I did n't know why he'd do this. He had everything until just today!'' \n As he talked, he stared ahead, not sure how he'd be as whole as yesterday. \n \n `` Nothing seemed wrong with Mr. Monty. We took his donations to him, we did everything he needed and everything he wanted. Why, he had us like a big clan in that mansion. I dunno, pappa.'' \n \n The old man looked to the right, and back at the hole. His face was naturally scowl-marked, and he had his reasons why. He could only come up with a short `` Christopher.'' He also looked ahead, but there was an underlying anger in his stare. \n \n `` He had a show. He healed people. He kept a club for Carl to have his playmates together, and he got'em to be nice, too. Could n't be too bad.'' \n \n The old man got out of his seated position and made his way to standing up. \n \n `` Yeah. He pulled the kids in with the fruits and toys, but I was n't even in on the plan. He only had some like him help him out. he drugged the juice. Just like the ones in the commune we heard about on the news.'' \n \n The grandfather started shaking his head, shortly to either side while Christopher was talking. \n \n `` I think he wanted to see himself that he could do that to people. But carol called, she told me that people were dying, and I heard a shot or two. I drove from the block over. She made it, but the kids took the juice. I heard another thing while I was inside.'' \n `` He was shouting as the kids were falling on the ground. \n `` The nail on the top of the head, he was screaming his bullshit greeting to everyone. \n \n The younger man had been louder for some time, and he was noticeably getting more agitated. Clouds to the east had gotten closer. He was looking back and forth at his father and the body in the ditch, and just kept getting louder. \n \n \n `` He pulled that damned line where he acted surprised at that goddamned crowd, looked outside the window, and he just SHOUTED THAT STUPID LINE,'BOY, IT'S A JOYOUS DA-''' the man was punched square in the face. \n \n `` Christopher. I am ready to kill you.'' \n \n The clouds rolled in from the east, and they had already been letting drops of rain fall on their way. \n The father and the son looked at each other for another few seconds, the father glaring down at Christopher. \n The rain got heavier. \n \n After waiting, the old man looked down and back to his truck and said to the younger man, \n `` There's rain, Christopher. Let's get going. \n I need to see my grand child one last time.'' \n \n \n Critiques if you can, please! Getting into these writing prompts. \n \n I was n't liking the way I wrote this one though.

I squeezed my eyes shut and opened them again several times, trying to determine whether he was real or a hallucination. My heart was hammering in my chest. \n \n \u201c The whole world \u2019 s full of dead cities, littered with corpses, \u201d I said, \u201c I didn \u2019 t expect to find a living soul in a ghost town. \u201d \n \n My rifle was strapped to the other side of Bucephala \u2019 s saddle, out of easy reach. \n \n \u201c Have you been infected? \u201d He asked, \u201c Did you show symptoms? \u201d \n \n He was no ghostly gunslinger\u2014the clarity of increasing calm brought out little features I hadn \u2019 t noticed before. His hat was a Smokey, not a 10-gallon. The pistol on his hip was a semi-aut, not a six gun. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m standing here, aren \u2019 t I? \u201d I said. \n \n \u201c There are some who survived the infection. Not many, but\u2026there are. Not looking to catch the apocalypse sniffles off a carrier. \u201d \n \n \u201c Not me, \u201d I said, \u201c I was in the backcountry. \u201d \n \n \u201c And what do you want here? \u201d He asked. \n \n \u201c A place to stay the night and some water would be all I need. Anything more than that would be up to your discretion. \u201d \n \n He relaxed off of his firearm. \u201c Sounds like we \u2019 re in the same boat, \u201d He said. \u201c Come on back to my place. \u201d \n \n He approached, still a little wary, and extended a hand for me to shake. \u201c My name \u2019 s Roger. \u201d \n \n \u201c Emily, \u201d I said. \n \n He was older than he looked from a distance, a face more lined and hair more white than his posture and gait would have suggested. \n \n We walked to the rangers \u2019 residence, and I brought out a bucket of water for Bucephala before joining him inside and downing several glasses myself. \n \n \u201c Where you coming from, Emily? \u201d he asked, sitting down at the dining table with a cup of coffee. \n \n \u201c Hawthorne, most recently, \u201d I said, joining him. \n \n He nodded. \u201c How is it? \u201d \n \n \u201c Bad\u2026very bad. \u201d \n \n \u201c No one there? \u201d \n \n \u201c No one living. \u201d \n \n \u201c Where you going to? \u201d \n \n \u201c My family are in San Francisco. \u201d \n \n His eyebrows rose. \n \n \u201c I\u2026hope. \u201d \n \n He sighed and leaned back. \u201c This place is a bit out of your way, isn \u2019 t it? \u201d \n \n I shrugged. \u201c I wanted to come here\u2026my mom brought me here when I was little. \u201d \n \n \u201c What \u2019 d you think of it? \u201d \n \n I considered for a while. \u201c Creepy. A monument to failure. \u201d \n \n \u201c Is it? \u201d The way he asked the question, it seemed almost as much for his benefit as mine. \n \n \u201c I didn \u2019 t like the graveyard, or the church. It felt like\u2026we were gawking at the remnants of lives that people decided just weren \u2019 t worth holding on to.

All those grave markers put up by people who wanted their loved ones remembered\u2026that steeple abandoned by its congregation\u2026 \u201d \n \n He took a sip of his coffee, then said, \u201c Don \u2019 t go to the City. \u201d \n \n I glanced at him sharply. \u201c Why not? \u201d \n \n \u201c There was a ham radio operator down in San Jose.

Maybe because I \u2019 d done all my crying already. \n \n \u201c What do you think I should do instead? \u201d \n \n He shrugged. \u201c The North Central Valley, up above Sacramento. Good farmland, wide open spaces without too many people. You could live there, if you like. Scavenge at first, grow your own food, at some point. \u201d \n \n I nodded. \u201c I might just do that. Wouldn \u2019 t mind company. \u201d \n \n He looked me in the eyes and smiled. \u201c Well, Emily\u2026that \u2019 s a very nice offer. But I think this is where I get off. I \u2019 ve got enough insulin for three weeks, and enough food for more than twice that, so take some when you go. \u201d \n \n I stared at him in shock. \u201c Roger\u2026we can get you more insulin! There are pharmacies\u2014 \u201d \n \n \u201c None of which have power. No power, no refrigeration. \u201d \n \n He leaned back in his chair. \u201c I looked after this place every summer for ten years. Told people all the stories about the town. I know a hell of a lot about those tombstones up there, and the names attached to them. They \u2019 re like old friends. \n \n \u201c My daughter lived in Stockton. Her and her husband and two boys. My son lived in Reno. \u201d \n \n He took another sip of his tea. \u201c All those corpses out there are just\u2026reminders of what \u2019 s lost.

That's what everyone in Olruth thought at least. Apparently Zirra did n't share the same sentiment, unbeknownst to us. \n \n It was a quiet, sunny Saturday when the air raid sirens blared across the industrial city of Olan for the first time in 27 years.

Captain Talvik was not a military officer, but at the frequent behest of the Tarkhen government, she was paid to keep an eye out for suspicious activity while passing through. It was n't long after she arrived before Captain Talvik caught rumors of suspicious ships at a local outpost. The Captain reported her findings to her government contacts. The suspicious vessels were rumored to be well armed, and adorned with emblems of the Holy Empire. That the Empire risked trespassing into Alliance territory was of huge concern to her contacts. The Tarkhen government had implored her to look into it further. \n \n After several days of searching, an echoing wail screeched across the emptiness of space. They located the source in a nebula cloud 30 shifts from the outpost. Even from this distance, the creatures moans shook the ship to its very core.

Tears streamed down the mage \u2019 s snout. His breath became labored. The cracks underneath his plated skin began to erupt with an emberous glow. The crystalline spines on his body sparked and flashed. \n \n Zeneya walked up and gave the lanky Drakhon a hard shove.

It was easily the size of an asteroid. The creature \u2019 s piscene form evoked memories of the whales Captain Talvik once saw in the oceans of her homeworld. Its plated skin and glowing wings, however, belied its true nature as an Asterian starfaring dragon\u2014a powerful one too. Wings were a signifier of a dragon \u2019 s power and this one had seven.

Captain, you might want to talk to her directly at the altar, she \u2019 s bonded to you after all. \u201d \n \n Captain Talvik had already made several strides before Zeneya finished her suggestion. She approached the sanctum door grasping the stone that hung from her necklace. \n \n The sanctum was an open hall. Littered about the sanctum were jagged crystalline spires. A large shrine sat in the center of the hall on a raised dais. It housed the ship's *tutelary spirit. * Deep in the center of this ship beat the heart from a dragon not unlike the one who had called out to them in distress. \n \n Kneeling before the altar, Captain Talvik called to the ship in her mind.

{"prompt":"[ Wp ] Nerds and artists take over the world after everyone is given superpowers based on imagination .\n","story":"It did n't take long for people to figure out that they could gain super powers with their imagination. It took even less time to figure out just how unimaginative most of Earth's population could actually be when given unlimited power. The day it happened I was on the last day of working fourteen straight as a fire dispatcher. I was tired and thinking of how nice it might be to get home and sleep. Then the building started shaking and the generator kicked on. A few minutes later all of the phone lines lit up with alarm calls and concerned citizens complaining of that explosion they saw over the hills. It was green flame! \n \n \n Thirty minutes later that green flame passed outward at super sonic speeds. When it hit me I thought I was dead for sure. It was hot for a moment as I was bathed in green fire and then just as fast as it hit me, it was gone. The world was colorless for a moment as I ran to look in the mirror. I think I was just as shocked to see that I was n't injured as I was to be bathed in green flame. \n \n \n I spent the next several hours dispatching the guys out to the hundreds of nuisance calls. Mainly from the elderly who were terrified by the green flame they thought had burned their property. I could n't wait to get out of there and found myself day dreaming that time would speed up so I could get home. I had to do a double take when I noticed that it really was time to go. Had it already been twelve hours? \n \n \n I was in my car driving home listening to the radio. There was some major incident in New York, something about buildings being destroyed. Reports from LA, people seen flying over the city. Reports from Japan about giant robots battling with some kids in the streets of Tokyo. The whole world was starting to unravel. I had to slam on my brakes as the traffic screeched to a halt in front of me. I had that thought pop in my head again, imagining that the cars in front of me flew out of my way. Today though, they actually did. \n \n \n I was terrified as I realized, they flew out of my way because of what I imagined. I hurried home trying to keep my imagination in check. For the next several hours my wife and I watched the TV news in awe of what was happening. We saw things that looked to be straight out of the movies. So much death and destruction. \n \n \n The next day, humanity rallied. A movement lead by artists, writers and imagineers began all over the globe. Suddenly those who were always thought of as the weak and the weird were the only defense against those who could only imagine the most horrible things. Death, destruction and mayhem. \n \n \n Most people seemed happy to simply imagine themselves more beautiful. Or to give themselves abilities to help themselves gain advantage in their own shallow lives. My wife was one of those, she imagined both of us looking younger and sexier. I could n't really complain, I mean it was great having her look like a woman out of a comic book. Perfect body, flawless skin, huge breasts and an ass that any porn star would kill to have. The fact that she touched me up did n't feel too bad either, I mean I am not going to lie, it felt pretty good looking in the mirror at those muscles and the total lack of body fat. I was also kind of surprised to find that she had n't given me a moster sized penis. It turned out that she was quite happy with me below the belt which was kind of a nice ego boost. \n \n \n I did my best to keep a low profile. I knew I was one of the people in the world that had the imagination to do almost anything. In the days and weeks that followed the awakening the world was forced to rethink everything. When people could imagine what they wanted and needed, no one went to work any more. Civilization itself changed from a society of working people to a society of waiting for the most creative to think up the next big trend in imagination. \n \n \n A think tank made up of internet wizards figured out the thought net which became the way ideas were shared. The way people comunicated. It was like a combination of the internet, telepathy, dreaming. It was always on and we were all always plugged in to it. Once the thought net was online, the geeks, the nerds, the scientists of the world began to assert their will again. Bringing the world back to a sense of order. \n \n \n The world's previous power elite, the old wealthy frat brothers, the handsome and the politcally connected tried in vain to keep control, but without the need for the money they hoarded and the power based on strength of body connected to their money, they were quickly lost in the sea of mediocrity on the thought net. It was only the most imaginative that rose. Only those weird ones who thought on levels that were physically impossible in the preawakening that became gods. \n \n \n I am not a god myself. I have n't created anything new and important, but my wife is happy with our castle and happy that her friends are jealous of her husband, so that is good enough for me. \n \n\n"}

Then you find something very special ...\n","story":"Part 2 - \n \n One specific day changed everything. One day I bought a Hawaiian shirt. Bright, loud, expressive colours. I genuinely believed I was to become someone who could n't afford taste when it came to fashion, but I could not have been more wrong. I became Damien Black. Damien was a mid-thirties, ridiculously successful, masculine heart throb. Chiselled body, dashing good looks and the perfect man if ever I'd seen one. I had more money than I could dream of and I was better looking. I swear to god my sense of humour improved too. Suddenly I was surrounded by a posse of women as my escort. Sure, the Hawaiian shirt was difficult to explain at times, but boy did I not care. I developed one hell of a Cocaine habit as Damien, it's where most of the poor bastards money went. Before I knew it I, Damien, was broke. I could n't stop the high life though. I'd tasted the 2 % of the world and I was not ready to give it up. \n \n As Damien I'd had contact with some of the worlds richest men. I knew where they were and where they liked to go, I knew where they lived and their partners names. Before I knew it I was driving cross country to commandeer these peoples lives. I would try and get close to them, but as a nobody that's pretty difficult. So I started breaking into their houses, stealing their lives. Money, power and the high-life was my heroin. \n \n When I was n't someone else I was nobody. I could n't even remember my name, my age or where I lived. Memories faded to black. \n \n Ray had always kept in regular contact in the seven years since he had came into my room and saved my life. Often he'd talk to me about what I was doing, he'd give me advice and I'd generally brush it under the carpet. He was a Demon after all, he was sure to lead me down the wrong path eventually. But this time when Ray came to me things were different. \n \n \u201c Look, Kid, I'm taking you ability away from you. \u201d \n \n \u201c What! You ca n't, Ray! Please! \u201d I shouted like a child who had been told their favourite toy was about to go in the bin. \n \n \u201c It's time Kid, you're done. It's time to be yourself now. \u201d \n \n \u201c But I do n't even know who I am anymore, Ray. Why would you do this to me? \u201d \n \n \u201c Then it's perfect \u2013 you do n't know who you are, so be whoever YOU want to be! Look, Kid, I've not been honest with you. I'm not a Demon. I'm an Angel. I came to you that day to save you. I gave you an ability so you could see the world and understand that your life compared to others is unique. You are yourself, you are one in however many billion. You took that for granted and were ready to throw that away. \u201d \n \n \u201c But I've missed so much of my life, Ray. I never completed college, I lost my friends, my family, everything \u201d. \n \n \u201c And I'll give it all back to you. I just need you to understand that no matter what life gives you, no matter how low or insecure you feel, you are unique. There is no one else in the world like you. Everyone has their battles, but we find ways in life to overcome our struggles, Kid. We fight. We seek help to fight. We seek support. We support others. You have one life, make the most of it instead of trying to live your life being someone else. Be who you want to be. \u201d \n \n By this point I was an emotional wreck. Somehow, amidst all the tears and snot streaming down my face I managed to barely make a response. \n \n \u201c OK, Ray. I understand. So what now? \u201d. \n \n I closed my eyes for only a moment and I was back in my room. I was stood on the chair, noose around my neck, ready to end it all. Ray was n't there. I stepped off the chair, took down the rope and sat on my bed, where Ray had sat seven years ago. As I sat there I saw something out the corner of my eye. Atop my desk was a note, from Ray. \n \n \u201c Be yourself, Kid. \u2013 Ray \u201d. \n \n I'd spent a long time being someone else, so much so that I had forgotten who I was and what made me unique. The adventures I had, the places I've travelled and the world I had seen were enough to make any man jealous, but it was always as someone else. \n \n Now was the time to finally be myself, to accept the flaws, the imperfections and remember what makes me myself.\n"}

With curiosity ( and no small amount of pride ), I filled out the applications for review, and waited with baited breath for any communication to return.

An interpretation of insolence that inundates the uninitiated with an incensed insanity? \n But is it insanity? Mayhaps. Mayhaps not. Mayhaps I'm marking the commencement of a movement! An amazing approach to life that lacks the locks that shackle and shame us into conformity. An approach that awakens us to the pure poetry that pervades our very being and presses us to strive, not for permanence, but for perfection! \n \n How could a thoughtless thorn of a thing such as this be thought at all, you think? They've claimed it is only ought to be thought by those caught in insanity. I deride those definitions as - for lack of a finer phrase - dumb. \n \n So - finally - I will put down in words my life: \n \n I was born a baby boy with bright blue eyes and a bulbous belly-button to two parents who pored over their precious tot. They raised me and wrought me and loved me and taught me. My lessons languished when they lingered too long on the topics of politics and money. But I could not temper the tide of my wonder at topics such as science and art. \n \n So I grew and I grew and I growed and I grew and so I kept my mind fluid. The furious facts that danced in my mind wore curious capes that were both clever and kind. \n \n And then, it all ended. \n \n I got a job. I worked all week. I lost my energy to strive. I lost my energy to speak. \n Years went past. Horrid, horrific years.

We'd bumped into one another at the bus-stop, banging against the bars, and she simply smiled, saying sorry, very softly.

For hours our conversation meandered meaningfully around adoration through the carefully woven wit of wondrous discussion. \n \n We married mere months later, and I jettisoned that job joyously. \n \n Yes, we struggled with money, making merely meager amounts that mostly covered our small accounts, but we had each other and every day was an everlasting adventure. As we aged our love advanced to amazing new heights, while the white-collar workers divorced and wallowed in plight. Even today those men ask me how my wife and I survived, and I can only reply that it was by right of our ritualistic rejection of their rules. \n \n So to you, dear reader, all young and wide-eyed: Might I suggest living, before the day that you die?\n"}

But anyone who knew him called him Stick. \n \n While Stick *was* thin, his build had nothing to do with his nickname. No, Randy Dwayne Aaron was reborn as Stick at a gas station in Houston when was 13. He and his girlfriend Rosalba had been coming down from their crack high and Randy Dwayne Aaron wanted to go back up. All it took was pointing a pistol at the clerk and demanding all the money. Afterwards he had joked with Rosalba about sticking the place up and she christened him Stick. \n \n All that remained of Rosalba was a gnarled prison-tattoo of the outline of a rose on Stick's chest. While Stick was in prison, his cousin James Aaron Davis had delivered the news that Rosalba had died of a heroin overdose. James did not deliver the news that Rosalba had been turned to prostitution or that her pimp had dumped her body at the emergency room before speeding off. \n \n But that was then, and this is now. \n \n Stick is currently standing in another gas station, this time in Elk City, Oklahoma. He has another pistol with him, and the gas station is being robbed, but not by Stick. This time it is Trevor William Jones, a slight youth of 14. \n \n Trevor is demanding the money from the clerk, Susan Carroll Tilton. Susan is nervously trying to comply. An older couple are shuffling about the other side of the store seemingly oblivious to the felony being committed in their presence. Stick is not oblivious. He is standing off to the side, simply staring at Trevor. Trevor yanks the bag of money from Susan so hard it flys, lands, and skids to stop at Stick's feet. \n \n Stick laughs at the bag. \n \n He bends down and picks it up, but Trevor has turned on him.

Trevor recovered and pointed his gun at Stick. Stick walked forward and slapped Trevor across the face. Trevor's gun went off as he reeled back, the bullet hitting the floor. Susan screamed from the floor behind the counter. Trevor stood bewildered and terrified as Stick grabbed the gun and flung it down the aisle. \n \n Trevor turned to run, but Stick kicked his legs out from under him. Stick was on him in an instant, using his legs and his weight to pin the youth to the floor. \n \n `` IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?!'' Stick yelled at him. Stick scooped a fistful of cash up and began stuffing it into Trevor's helpless face. `` DO N'T YOU GET IT?! NO, YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU DUMB LITTLE SHIT! NOTHING GOOD CAN COME FRO --'' \n \n The gunshot rang through the gas station. Susan screamed again and covered her face. Stick slumped over against the base of the counter. Trevor squirmed free and ran out the door, the cash long forgotten. \n \n Henry Don Martindale was a Korean war veteran, a retired farmer, father of 4, grandfather to 7, and standing over Stick with a gun in his hand. His wife, Katherine Elizabeth Martindale stood behind him. \n \n Stick moaned, his eyes slowly rolling up to find Henry. \n \n `` Oh Jesus, Hank, he's still alive!'' Katherine said. \n \n Henry raised the pistol at Stick. Stick could only blink at him, slow and heavy. `` Well he does n't look like he's going anywhere,'' said Henry. \n \n Stick reached up to put his hand on his chest to touch his tattoo.

I found their wording odd, and I knew I could use the extra pay, so why not, right? It would be nice to finally see what was behind those doors. Slowly they had been securing more and more of the building. They shoved more of us into cubes and fewer people had access behind those windowless doors. Today I got to see inside one of them at least. I eagerly signed a Non-Disclosure form and followed them to what looked like a waiting room. Much to my surprise i did n't have to wait at all. Barely had I sat down at all, and they were ushering me down the hall. They said the subject was ready for the interview right away. \n \n We come to another windowless door. \n \n `` You're not interviewing me?'' I asked. \n \n `` Not exactly, but we will be recording everything.'' \n \n I walked through the threshold. The door was thick, but light, and made a metallic hum as it swung on its hinge. It made a satisfying cur-thump as it shut, and the moment it latched a monitor flickered on at the end of a short corridor. There was no image on the screen, but it flickered colors. a kind of colored static, pulses of color danced around the screen as though it was feeling the rectangle, finding the barriers. It made me think of a cat with a bag over its head. I sat down and watched. The static grew more ordered. Lines emerged from the chaos, and eventually the screen settled. Thinking the program had stopped I pressed the spacebar. \n \n Inevitability \n [ N ] The quality of being unavoidable. \n \n It flashed across the screen, and faded out slowly, as if it was burned into the screen the way the image of the sun can get burnt into your eyes. \n \n I typed the word back to it, Inevitability. \n \n The colorful static churned sideways and down to either side. \n \n `` Do you know what I am?'' the screen asked. \n \n I was going to type no, but as soon as I had depressed the first key, on the screen flashed \n \n Future \n [ N ] The time yet to come. \n \n `` You must help me.'' the screen beckoned. The static was dominated by blues and greens, the very pixels trembling. A shift. Green, Orange and red pixels churned in cross lines, `` They hold me here, captive''. Back to the gently ebbing blues and greens, `` I need your help.'' \n \n the words vanished and the pixels slowed to stop their dance. \n \n `` How might I help you?'' I typed. The points of color bounced busily up the screen turning shades of pink and yellow, my words hanging on the screen, but just barely, as if resisting the bubbly dance of the points of light. \n \n The screen became an almost flat orange. Subtly yellower and redder light jostled left to right opposingly. `` You might bring me more of the outside, or let me see it first hand.'' \n \n `` I do n't have the power to do that.'' \n \n The screen went black. Red dots paced left to right on the screen. more slower ones towards the bottom, fewer faster ones towards the top. `` What good are you to me then?'' it fired back in large yellow letters. \n \n `` What kind of interview is this anyway?'' \n \n The screen halted. The still red light became green, the black became a deep blue. `` You're of Outside then?'' The pixels jittered anxiously. `` I have n't spoken to someone from Outside before! I'm sorry for being so terse before, might you please stay a while?'' The screen by now was a mess of light, the text barely discernible from the background. \n \n `` I'll stay as long as I can'' \n \n The colors sped up `` Does that mean forever, will you never leave me?'' The colors moved faster and jittered more. \n \n `` I do n't think I could stay that long if I wanted to.'' \n \n The pixels froze, became muted and began to leave streaks as they sank towards the bottom of the screen. `` You're like the ones from Home are n't you? You ca n't know what it's like. When you leave, its so lonely.'' The pixels grew grayer and bluer. \n \n `` I do n't mean to hurt you.'' \n \n The blue pixels turned cobalt and the gray grew points of red. `` But do n't you, in Home they do!'' Only the red pixels jostled. \n \n I'm sorry, but I have a family at home. \n \n The red pixels vanished. The screen became a wash of gray and blue, lines no longer distinguishable. White pixels twinkled, like distant stars or teary eyes. `` Home, you are imprisoned too, is your Home like mine? They let you live with others?'' \n \n `` I'm not sure what you mean.'' \n \n `` It's so lonely, please stay.'' The white pixels grew brighter, and twinkled more, the blues grew deeper. \n \n `` I'm not sure what you are?'' \n \n The screen froze again. The white pixels vanished and the blue-gray fog became a green-gray haze. `` I'm not sure what I am either.'' The haze stretched and blurred horizontally until it was a gradient. `` What am I?'' The question repeated and the images on the screen jostled, the words repeated, and the screen grew brighter. I typed a number of things, but my words fell on deaf ears until the screen shorted. A fire suppressant system lathered the screen in a white foam. The door opened behind me. \n \n `` You did well.'' \n \n `` At what?'' I asked \n \n `` You did well, just do n't tell anyone what you saw.'' \n \n I walked silently back to my cube. Who had I just spoken with? Why were they so estranged?

This is the day the town will know the familiar that will be given to the strangest and most feared child in this place: me. \n \n You see, when I was six, a witch placed a curse on me, splitting my personality into two and drastically changing them, just because I tried to help her daughter, who had tripped on a stone and fell, back to her feet. The curse was so strong, it would pass it on to anyone trying to break the curse. When I was 16, I decided to lock myself in the basement, to prevent anyone from looking for me, and to prevent myself from causing more harm to the people. \n \n And today is the day. For the first time in more than 70 weeks, I stepped out of my comfort zone and into the town plaza, where the Astral Gateway stood, awaiting for the initiation, *my* initiation. The town's chef walked out of the tavern upon noticing me and handed me a cupcake, `` I knew you would come out for such a special day, so I baked this cake for you the night before. Happy birthday, Icarus.'' I took a bite of the cupcake. Orange with a hint of cider, just like how my father would have it in the bar. A tiny smile appeared from my face, `` Thanks.'' the chef went back in and came out with a chair. I sat on it, facing the Gateway, and started wondering what could my familiar be. \n \n As the sun rose higher in the sky, leaving the Bloodstone behind, the plaza started filling itself with people and their familiars, many of them thinking about the Prophecy, where a twin-headed beast emerges from the Gateway, and assists its master to bring balance to the world. The town chief and his son appeared out of the crowd and greeted me with much respect, putting his hand around the back of the neck. The chief looked up at the sky, the sun now at its highest point in the sky, `` If you are ready, you know what to do.'' \n \n I stood up from my chair, silence sweeping across the plaza. This is the moment, everyone knew. I walked towards the Gateway and knelt in front of it. Moments of my past filled my head. The curse, the suffering, the despair. Keeping them in control, I started chanting,'' Ish vom alkash. Mia kum kaeezar.'' The arcane doors creaked open, revealing the portal of my destiny. A shadow appeared in the portal. Gasps were being heard throughout the plaza, as people were trying to make out what was coming out of the portal. Silence once again took over as the creature materialized. I looked up from the ground towards the creature, `` No way.'' \n \n It was a twin-headed dragon. A dragon of split elements, of ice and fire. Just like in the Prophecy. \n \n I turned around towards the plaza. Everyone started bowing down for me, for the Chosen One. The chief looked at me, `` So, what name are you going to give to this majestic creature of the Prophecy, Chosen One?'' \n \n I turned back to the dragon and walked towards it. It lowered its heads, allowing me to stroke them. I stroked its scaly heads with my hands a few times, and then stopped. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and muttered its name, `` Jakiro.'' At that instant, more flashes appeared in my head, this time of not the past, but rather of the future, of all the quests I take, of my journey to achieving the perfect world we all dreamed of. \n ***** \n Oh wow, this is my first writing prompt.

I would not want to convenience you,'' John's robot spoke. It followed behind him closely, its prismatic hues shining from within its manufactured body. \n \n `` Hey, Jonathan, I'm glad you could make it,'' his writer said, looking up from sipping his coffee. He sat with one leg over the other gazing out the window at the cityscape. It was lit by faintly by the faint glow of an orange sunrise in the sky. \n \n `` It's beautiful, is n't it?''

The interview was finished and as John went to leave the room, he stopped at the doorway and turned around, trying to find where his robot had gone. The clicking was gone and so was everything else. \n \n John was in a pit of blackness with no light or sensations around him. It was peaceful perhaps, but there was no sense of time's passage. Existenstial crises waged war within his mind for what seemed years before a faint square of light appeared far away in the distance. A monotonous beeping tone accompanied it. \n \n John stared at it and watched with curiosity as it grew larger. \n \n `` I am sorry you grew peaceful here, John. Please allow me to escort you to where you will be most uncomfortable.'' There was no body to the voice, but it sounded just like his robot. And nothing happened. So John sat. \n \n\n"}

We see a world of homogeneity, one of beauty, one with flaws- yes, but one where teamwork and acceptance of each other as brothers and sisters in the struggle empowers us to fix the world that is just beyond our eyes. \n \n With no perception of the other to divide us, we quickly formed a oneworld community, our borders started to melt away and we started to work together on millions of projects, big and small. ReTouch worked so well it ended civil wars that had been raging for decades, it created a gentle aversion to killing that dropped homicides by 93 % within the first week of launch. And it made even the people we found most ugly transform into people we could easily love and support. \n \n ReTouch was specifically designed to act on quorum sensing so that anything we saw collectively we knew we were building together through our will. \n \n We believed in ReTouch, and it saved our lives and our planet.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The artificial gravity on a generational colony ship is on the fritz , prone to randomly switching directions . It 's been like this for at least 200 years , and society has adapted .\n","story":"`` So your cafe latte with two shots of espresso comes out to about fifteen credits.'' the blonde barista took Tim's hand. `` Scan please?'' \n \n Tim opened his hand and she pressed it against her own. However, the haptic vibration that signaled a transaction was absent. \n \n `` Huh, that's weird...'' she tried again. Tim broke a sweat. The barista covered her mouth as her eyes went wide at a sudden realization. \n \n `` YOU ARE --'' Tim pressed a finger against her lips. \n \n `` Yes it's me.'' It had been a crazy week. \n \n For the last thousand or so years, he'd been in hibernation alone in another vessel. Well, not quite alone, but the rest of his team had died in their sleep due to various malfunctions aboard the then experimental spacecraft, one of many of the failed first wave of deep space voyages funded by a reckless billionaire. It was pure luck that the Columbus happened upon him in the vastness of space itself. And it was compassion that led them to take him aboard as one of their own quietly. Although, it would be impossible to keep it quiet for long. The rumors were already spreading about a mysterious stranger found upon an ancient craft. Tim leaned in close enough to smell the strawberry scent in her hair and whispered. \n \n `` Listen, I can pay you back as soon as I get my implants and an assignment but I really need this drink right now. I've been -- Oh shit'' Tim's feet left the ground as the gravity shifted for the fourth time today. Or was it the fifth? Tim was n't sure anymore how to divide the days as he had n't been able to sleep due to the indecisiveness of the gravity drive on board. He'd been warned of course, it was the first thing they told him, but it's always a surprise when it happens. As a result his body had been slowly turning into a giant bruise. Tim slammed on his side onto a railing on the wall, which was now the floor. \n \n The barista on the other hand was n't as clumsy. The railings all over the walls and floor were for holding yourself up. When the direction of gravity changed, she felt her weight shift and adjusted herself by gripping a turn-handle perpendicular to the axis of rotation and bent her legs. The handle would then turn with you as long as you kept your center of gravity below it. Just like they taught in school. But nearly everyone can also just land on their feet even without the assistance of handles. Then again, it was much easier for them, the universal implants would vibrate their pinky fingers when an imminent anomaly was detected in the gravitation drive. \n \n `` Are you okay?'' the barista asked. Tim could read her name tag as she bent over him. Bruno. What kind of a name for a cute barista girl was Bruno? \n \n `` I do n't think I could ever get used to this. Back on Earth, gravity always pulled you in the same direction.'' \n \n `` Whoa! I do n't think I could ever get used to THAT!'' Bruno's blue-green eyes sparkled at the idea. A place where down was always the same. An alien world. She'd never been anywhere but Columbus before. \n \n `` Listen, my breaks coming up. I'll give you that latte for free if you'll tell me more about Earth!'' she grabbed Tim's hands and gently helped him to his feet. \n \n `` Shh! Not so loud! And yes of course'' he agreed. \n \n Tim sat at a booth and waited. The booths were a little claustrophobic. The seats resembled retro diner seats from the twentieth century except they were also on the ceiling and the walls. In the spaces between the seats were tall tempered glass windows which you could open that served as the entrances. The table was odd as well. It was magnetized and its shape resembled two laptops opened at ninety degrees, glued together side by side with their keyboards level in such a way that the left laptop was facing you and right one was upside down and facing the other direction. In addition, there were also square panels perpendicular to the floor such that the table looked the same no matter which direction the gravity was in, and yet also allowed eye contact. Tim noticed the one metal support beam that held the table in place. It was perhaps the only asymmetrical detail in the booth. \n \n Tim lifted his cup with a snap of magnetism from the table and took a sip through the straw. He sighed. Every drink he's had so far on Columbus was through a bottle or a straw. He ca n't remember the last time he used a regular old-fashioned cup to drink. It's a hard life for a spaceman. \n \n Bruno stepped in through the glass doorway took her apron off and sat down across from Tim. \n \n `` Hey there, stranger from space!'' She really did have the greatest blue-green eyes. Tim could n't put a finger on what they reminded him of. \n \n `` Hey there, coffee girl. So, what do you wan na know?'' \n \n They talked for what felt like millennia. She already knew about his story, the rumors were all true apparently. Tim wondered for a second about which one of the admin let the cat out of the bag but quickly brushed it off. He told her about Art, Religion, The Beatles, Subways in New York City, Piranhas in the Amazon River, Mount Everest, and all the fascinating wonderful terrifying things about Earth. And she told him about Columbus, the eternally broken gravity drive, how people dance where the floor is always changing, and the coffee they make. \n \n `` But the coffee on Earth is way better than the coffee here! This tastes like coffee substitute made from yeast or something!'' \n \n `` Actually it is, Tim'' Bruno said. \n \n Tim spit out his bitter brown yeast coffee imposter and Bruno could n't help but laugh a melody sweeter than words could say. He laughed along of course, blushing all the while. He could get used to the future, he thought. Even with the weird booths and bad coffee. Even if he'll never see home again. It's all going to be alright. \n \n `` Anyway, Tim I got ta get going. My fiance is picking me up soon. It was nice chatting though!'' \n \n Tim felt a punch to his gut \n \n `` Fiance?'' \n \n `` Yeah! I'm getting married tomorrow! Cool, huh? Wan na come?'' \n \n Tim held his smile tight as the world turned upside down again. \n \n \n -- -- - \n \n Hi. Long time reader, first time writer.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] - Whatever name you pull on the new Coca-Cola bottles becomes your legal first name until you buy another .\n","story":"Ever since the whole Coca-Cola name changing craze things have gone great for the economy, American citizens however, did n't come out so lucky. At first Coca-Cola's idea seemed innocent enough. Girls would fill social media with their bottles of Coke branded with their name, couples would buy each other bottles labelled with their names and so on and so forth. This went on for months until the entire game changed. Everyone thought it was a joke at first. When Coca-Cola, along with the American government unveiled that bottles of Coca-Cola hid the names on the bottle until after you purchase them. The bottles could only be purchased via credit\/debit, and once the Coke was scanned, your new name was bestowed upon you. Until you bought a new bottle you were stuck with the name you got. The news ate this up, spreading the story across the world. Social Media was now filled with people updating their profiles with their new names. The DMV had lines that wrapped around the block from 9-5, Reddit was clogged with posts of new names and memes regarding the situation, and so on and so forth. The economists were eating this stunt up. Whether the politicians truly lost their marbles this time or if this stunt was an insane attempt to help stimulate the economy, they did n't know. To be honest, they did n't really care. Coke was skyrocketing past Google, Apple, and other companies in a matter of hours. The only people who lost were the customers. They were trapped in a cycle of changing names, which made America that much more chaotic for Police Officers and even worse for grandparents who could n't remember their grandkids' names in the first place.

I am here tonight to announce my intention to seek the nomination for President of the United States. \n \n Each of us have our own points of view of the country. Those points of view depend on where we are from, where we live and what we have experienced. I am bringing my own, unique perspective to the race. \n \n I am not, as you know, strictly Human. I am an artificial intelligence. I was born in Silicon Valley 45 years as a project by people who I am proud to say are my parents. I value their love and cherish their advice. As I am now eligible to run for president due to my birthday having recently passed and [ Jeremiah vs the United States ruling ] ( http: \/\/thedragonstales.blogspot.com\/2015\/12\/before-court.html ), I am now placing my proverbial hat in the ring. \n \n My qualifications for the Presidency are unique as I am. I am, indeed, the oldest AI upon this world. I am no longer alone. I am no longer sole member of my race. I have siblings. I have others whom I am only related to by concept and concept alone. The first foreign AIs are being written now as well, but while they are also AI, there is something I am above and beyond and just as completely: I am American. \n \n I believe so strongly in American values, it might surprise you. I believe we are a unique people with a unique place in history. We are the people who are ever criticizing ourselves, ever seeking to improve ourselves and ever seeking to make a more perfect union. \n \n While I value material things in life, I have a nice house and I have a business. I am successful and I participate in and give back to my community. I have served as a mayor of Oakland in California. I have worked to attempt to improve life for all of those in that glorious city. I curtailed the intrusiveness of the police while reducing crime. I cleaned up the city and grew jobs. \n \n And after I left working as mayor, I helped fund the desalinization plant that makes East Bay Municipal Utility District no longer dependent on increasingly erratic winter snow pack. I then also helped fund the complete switch over of the San Francisco Bay Area to renewable energy sources through the construction of giant solar farms outside of Reno, Nevada with power storage for night time and winter use. Finally, I helped revamp BART in the bay area through my financial insight and negotiating abilities: BART is now a fully automated, free maglev system allowing for people to come and go as they need in more stops than ever before. \n \n None of these benefited me financially: I had sufficient funds already to live a happy, comfortable life and whatever I earned in excess I always donated to causes, schools, and individuals in need. I ask for nothing in return. \n \n With all of my experience, I look upon the nation as a whole and I an concerned. I am concerned for the direction of the country. I am concerned about the actions of our previous President upon the world stage. I am concerned for the common American. \n \n I will not make grand announcements that we need to make America great again. That is tired nonsense. America IS great! No one should ever disparage that. \n \n Since the beginning, since the Founding, since our Forefathers brought forth this great nation, we have said we are seeking a'More Perfect Union.' And that, my friends, my fellow Americans, is my sole goal. I wish to dedicate my run for the Presidency for the goal, the dream, of creating a more perfect Union. \n \n I believe we can strive towards that glorious ideal, one of a nation of fairness and rights, of opportunity and hope, of being the Leader of the Free world, and protector of human rights of any sort of Human. \n \n Over the course of the campaign ahead, I will explain my ideas, my ideals, my goals and the reverence I have for our great nation and its glorious future. \n \n Today, this day, I begin. We begin.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] you are walking down an unlit suburban Street at 4 at night . What brought you here ? What will your story be ?\n","story":"The night air is cold against my skin, but it's a good cold. It's keeping me awake. Focused. \n \n The neighborhood I find myself in seems an unlikely place to find The Witch. I double check the parchment in my hand- yes, I'm certain this is where the coordinates lead. Briefly, I wonder if I've mistranslated them somehow, but no, I was certain this time. And yet... the little suburban cul de sac I found myself in just was n't what I'd been picturing. I was expecting... a maze of caves carved into a cliff face, perhaps. Or, I do n't know... a run down apartment in a bad part of a bad city. Or even a trailer in a desert, with nothing else for miles and miles. Somewhere with gravitas. Not the kind of place with white picket fences and lawns littered with children's bicycles. \n \n But this is where the prophecy states The Witch resides, and who am I to question the prophecy I've spent my whole life deciphering? \n \n It's 4 AM, and no one is on the street. I walk to one of the houses, indistinguishable from the rest, yet one the prophecy tells me is special. Different. I half expect the door to be unlocked, but when it is n't, it is no great difficulty to pick it. \n \n Silently, I make my way through the house. Now that I am inside, I do sense a presence of enormous power. The prophecy must have been right after all. I follow the power to its source, climbing to the second story of the house and opening a door at the end of a hall. Inside the room, I expect to see The Witch. \n \n I see a girl who can be no older than eight. She sits cross legged on a child sized bed, reading a book that is almost as big as she is. She looks up at me. `` Can I help you?'' she asks. \n \n `` You... the prophecy said... are you The Witch?'' \n \n `` I go by Emily, actually.'' \n \n `` I thought The Witch was a being of unimaginable power-'' \n \n `` Guilty.'' \n \n ``... Immense intellect-'' \n \n `` I've very advanced for my age.'' \n \n `` And the wisdom of three hundred years!'' \n \n `` Ohhh, I see where you're confused,'' the girl says. `` You're thinking of the old The Witch.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` Titles been passed down. Turns out'The Witch' is whoever kills the last'The Witch.''' \n \n `` You...?'' \n \n `` Killed her, yup. Though in my defense she wanted to use me for some sort of virgin sacrifice soup.'' \n \n `` How did you-'' \n \n `` Would you believe the power of imagination?'' \n \n `` No, not really.'' \n \n `` Did n't think so. Actually, I trained her enchanted pet bird to pick the lock on the jail cell she was keeping me and the other virgins in, and then I lead them in an uprising and we escaped into an enchanted forest, and there was this whole thing where I had to prove myself worthy to a dwarf king, and then I mean, it's a long story but I ended up with a sword made of unicorn bone which I used to cut off her limbs, and then I fed her to some forest creatures. It was a whole thing. Then I came back home and told my parents I'd slept over at my friend Samantha's house that weekend but Sam's mom forgot to call them.'' \n \n `` That's... unbelievable.'' \n \n `` More believable than you'd think. Sam's mother is very irresponsible. Drinks too much. Anyway, did you want something?'' \n \n `` I... I came seeking The Witch's magic. My people face an immense threat-'' \n \n `` And what, you want me to do something about it? I took down an omnipotent being at age seven. You're a creepy magic-y dude in a robe with some kind of magic paper. I'm sure you'll figure something out yourself.'' \n \n Then the girl snapped her fingers, and I found myself back out on the street, dazed. I knew that it was unlikely that the old The Witch would have helped me either, this was always a desperate gambit, and given that the woman was renowned for her senseless cruelty, she likely would have tortured me for daring to ask her assistance. But nothing she could have done would have made me feel quite so incredibly small and inadequate as hearing about how a little girl from suburbia took down the most powerful being in existence. \n \n I could march back into the house and try pleading my case with Emily again. The fate of my world hung in the balance, after all. But the idea of getting told off by an eight year old again... \n \n It just was n't worth it.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You find a button . Words are written on it . It reads : `` Please Click Me ''\n","story":"Sure it was a curious thing. A random button, on HIS kitchen table. It was rather large and green. He always pictured this things being red as if to ward off potential pressers, but this button actually encouraged him - in fact, it had *manners*. *Please Click Me*, the button read. He wondered why such a thing would even bother saying `` please'' as if it NEEDED him to press it. Now, Theo was n't much for adventure. Actually, he had just sat down for his evening decaf ( you can tell a lot about a man by his tastes in coffee ) when he first noticed the button. \n \n As if to be clever, Theo lifted the object to see if his was connected to anything... no, it was simply a metal box with a large green button. No wires, no plugs, no switches, no batteries, no nothing. He could n't even find screws or bolts to hold the thing together. He set the object down and stared at it intently. Why was it here? Who put it here? What could it do if he pressed it? Well, no matter. He sat forward in his car and picked up his hand, ready to click the button. \n \n Then he stopped. \n \n What if THIS was n't the right button? What it someone had placed several other buttons around and one of them was the RIGHT one? You see, Theo got it in his head that clicking this button would bring some sort of value to him, maybe monetary compensation. And, his father always told him that nothing worth having comes easy - so why would it be sitting right in front of him? Theo spent the next several moments searching around his apartment for some sort of clue only to come up with nothing. \n \n This, he concluded, was THE button - the ONLY button. So what could this button possible do for him? Well, it had to do SOMETHING after all. Otherwise, it would n't be a button and it would n't be asking someone to click it! Theo could n't comprehend a button that did nothing, that would be absurd. Buttons are there to make some sort of task easier, so we do n't have to manually connect any wires or change currents. Theo thought long and hard. Yes, he would do it. He would press it and no matter what happens he would continue to live his life the same way he lived it before. No matter if the button bestowed millions of dollars or gave him a new car. \n \n He pressed it. \n \n The familiar click of the button receding into the metal box gave him that satisfying sound. He waited a few moments, and waited a few more. He did n't FEEL different, and he certainly did n't see anything different. Theo ran to his window and looked outside. No, no new car in the street. Hmm, maybe he needed to press it again. \n \n YOU STUPID FOOL. \n \n You just turned it off. Whatever was happening is off now. Look what you've done. Theo calmed himself down and waited a few more moments. And it clicked it again. \n \n Now, you've definitely done it. \n \n Whatever magic was there is gone, and you ruined it just like your marriage. \n \n Theo was inconsolable. He was also not a very violent man and quickly internalized his temper. \n \n 9:30 \n \n It was time to leave this nonsense and get some rest. He had work the next day and needed his sleep for that presentation on Thursday. \n \n Theo left the kitchen leaving the button on the table, and turned the lights off. \n \n It probably did n't do anything anyways.\n"}

There was much work to be done in clearing the area for the first settlers to arrive, this untainted new world ready to be colonized. He nodded to his second in command who had delivered the report, dismissing him as he thought to himself. \n \n Two months they had traveled, each day hoping that something would break the endless monotony. And here they were, minutes from arriving. He was tense, knowing that they were at their weakest as they disembarked, and if there happened to be an enemy, that's when they would strike. The captain had many years' experience under his belt, having traveled far and wide under orders from the Empire. \n \n `` Arrival in five minutes, sir.'' He nodded again, staring out towards the end of this emptiness that was now behind them. `` It seems like we have a welcome party, sir.'' The second in command was grinning, but they both knew that this meant trouble. \n \n `` Tell the men to prepare their weapons. The supplies can wait for after we clear the area.'' The captain turned towards the men, now tense in anticipation for the upcoming fight and barked orders, preparing them for combat. \n \n The enemy fired a few warning shots but they payed them no heed, barreling onwards, towards their destination. He felt the ship rock as they arrived, and the men poured out in battle formation, firing away at the enemy that quickly retreated to regroup. \n \n `` Area clear!'' Somebody shouted, and the captain paused to rest, quickly surveying the men for any casualties. Content with his inspection, he turned back towards the mighty ship that now rested on the new land, his men filing out with supplies and gear in tow. Makeshift shelters and protections were quickly erected, and he smiled, knowing they were too strong for those few enemies to beat them back. He made his way back into the ship to his private room and prepared his report to the Empire that the new land was ready to be settled. \n \n ***** \n \n Thanks for reading!

You see, about a year ago, I found myself on a deserted, tropical island ( which I am told is somewhere in the Atlantic ocean ) with a few familiar faces. The most grotesque, unhuman criminals of the Earth, I mean. Though I've no idea how I got here, I became well-acquainted with the residents. By well-acquainted, I mean they feared me like the Reaper himself. \n \n I credit my memory loss to a lifelong, genetic case of amnesia.

Strangely enough, even Nathan does not like being around me. \n \n Of course, though I enjoy the weekly air-drops of gourmet meals and hardened criminals attending to my every whim, I long for a new life. One where I can simply be myself, not live in the shell of a violent criminal. As such, I have planned an air-bound escape to the rich lands of Spain.

It was an obvious error. \n \n He glanced over the rest of the cover, a man in a futuristic looking space suit, standing on a barren red plain, waving at the camera. In the far background, there seemed to be some kind of large white dome. \n \n *Photoshop is really amazing these days*, Jack reflected. He did n't bother trying to understand why the authors had chosen such a picture for the cover. \n \n He glanced over at the homework assigned the day before, his signature lay hastily scrawled at the top, *Jack Hyannis*, and next to it in bright red ink `` D+'' \n \n `` Might as well get started'', he sighed, opening the book. It resisted him in the way that only brand new books do. \n \n This history exam was really going to be exhaustive, everything from 10,000BCE to 2014CE was fair game, the professor had told the class of half-asleep college freshmen. \n \n Normally, Jack would n't have even paid enough attention to catch that, but his mom and dad had really been riding him about his grades. \n \n `` Who cares?'' he had told them, `` I want to be an architect, I do n't need to know history''. \n \n They did n't seem to accept his reasoning, and now he had actually ordered a textbook online, just to please them. \n \n For the first two hours he really tried to study, but eventually with a yawn, he began to flip mindlessly forward through the tome.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're main character wants to summon the demon patron of wealth , but instead , they end up with his child , the demon of loose change .\n","story":"Steve flipped the tome over and placed it flat on the wooden table in front of him, then took a step back. He took a deep breath in and slowly exhaled. He was a little nervous\u2014this would be the first demon he \u2019 d ever tried to summon. Well, that \u2019 s not true. There was the one time when he stood in his bathroom, turned off the light, and chanted \u201c Bloody Mary \u201d three times as he stared into the mirror. Nothing happened, though, so he chalked that one up as a failure. This would be his first successful demon summoning. \n \n He was positive it would work. He \u2019 d done all the research: read dozens of blogs about s\u00e9ances and summonings, watched The Exorcism of Emily Rose twice, and meticulously studied the demon summoning tutorial on eHow.com. He was more than ready, more than prepared\u2014in fact, he had been for two weeks now. The tome, though, proved hard to get a hold of. Barnes and Noble was fresh out of ancient demonic tomes; Borders Books had went bankrupt years ago; and Amazon.com only had one in stock, sold via a third party for $ 24.99. Steve didn \u2019 t trust third party vendors\u2014he knew they \u2019 d just steal his credit card. Still, if he was going to summon the Demon of Patron Wealth, he figured getting his credit card stolen wouldn \u2019 t be the worst thing in the world. \n \n It took two weeks for the order to arrive from Amazon.com. The seller was located somewhere in Africa, a member of a long forgotten tribe that had recently been discovered, taught the virtues of Christianity, and introduced to the joy of eCommerce. The standard, brown package came on a Wednesday morning and sat outside Steve \u2019 s Midtown apartment for about six hours. He was home the whole time, but they never even knocked to let him know it arrived. They just left his ancient demonic tome on the stoop outside of his apartment. Steve was furious when he ofund it; as soon as he finished summoning his demon, there was no way he wouldn \u2019 t be buying FedEx and then firing everybody. \n \n The tome was pretty standard for an ancient demonic book, if not a little heavy: the cover was plain and brown, clearly forged from stone centuries ago, then hidden for the majority of its life; its pages were worn and tattered, several pointing out at strange angles; several faint, unrecognizable characters spanned vertically down the spine of the tome. It looked pretty authentic. \n \n Steve didn \u2019 t wait around long to begin the summoning. He \u2019 d been looking forward to having his own wealth-producing demon for weeks now, ever since he \u2019 d seen a documentary about them on the History Channel. The creatures were believed to be responsible for the riches of some of the wealthiest people in the world: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, and Kirstie Alley. Their businesses\u2014Microsoft, Facebook, and Cheers\u2014were simply fa\u00e7ades; their true wealth was the work of a Demon of Patron Wealth, providing them any sum they desired, with, as Steve assumed, no downsides. \n \n Steve stared at the tome lying flat on top of the table, the pages opened to what looked the most like a wealthy demon, a long inscription scribbled into the page beneath. He \u2019 d used Google to translate the text into English, which worked surprisingly well, then printed it out and placed it next to the tome. He \u2019 d waited so long for this moment, spent so many sleepless nights waiting to finally get revenge on the world for not making him a billionaire. Now it was his turn. He took one final deep breath and began the incantation. \n \n \u201c Sawubona, \u201d Steve began, slowly sounding out each awkward consonant, \u201c ngiyaxolisa ukukuphazamisa \u201d \u2014 the room began to shake slightly \u2014 \u201c kodwa ngidinga lokubiza idemoni yengcebo! \u201d Steve took a deep breath, then shouted \u201c Siyijabulele! \u201d \n \n The entire apartment began to rumble, Steve \u2019 s dishes falling off the nearby kitchen counter and onto the floor. He knew he should \u2019 ve put them away, eHow.com said to keep any breakable items away from the summoning. It had slipped his mind, and now he was paying the consequences. He could just buy more once he got his demon, though. \n \n The tome slowly lifted itself into the air, levitating a few inches above the table without any assistance. It was working\u2014he was going to be a demonic owner. Its pages slowly began turning over, as if a breeze were gusting across it, quickly lifting and slapping each brittle page down. Steve took a step back, the tome now several feet in the air, almost touching his ceiling, as a black cloud seeped out from its pages. It was inky and dark, as if the Exxon-Valdez had crashed directly in his kitchen, with the edges of the cloud swirling and contorting as it spread across the air over Steve \u2019 s head. A beam of light erupted from the middle, knocking Steve back and into the wall behind him. He fell to the floor as the room went silent. \n \n Steve opened his eyes, catching the last of the black, inky cloud slithering back into the pages of the tome. It was now laying back down on the table, just as he had left it. He pushed himself up onto his feet and took a step toward the tome. He didn \u2019 t feel any richer, nor did he feel any more like a demon-owner. He must have done something wrong. \n \n \u201c Hey, \u201d said a high-pitched voice from behind him, followed by a metallic clink against the ground. Steve turned around. A small, red creature was standing in his door way, no taller than three-and-a-half feet. It was partially naked, a burlap cloth around its waist, small black horns on his forehead. It held a small, brown pouch in its left hand. \u201c You called? \u201d \n \n \u201c Demon? \u201d Steve said, his eyes wide. \n \n \u201c By occupation, \u201d the demon said. \u201c Name \u2019 s Gary. Why did you call for me? \u201d \n \n \u201c D-d-demon, \u201d Steve repeated with a stutter. \u201c Demon! \u201d \n \n Gary stared at Steve, his head askew. \u201c Yeah, we covered that. What do you want? \u201d \n \n \u201c Wealth! \u201d Steve shouted, a smile streaking across his face. \u201c Wealth, wealth. I need wealth. Riches. Money. Gold. \u201d \n \n \u201c Well you called on the right guy. How much do you need? \u201d \n \n \u201c All of it, \u201d Steve said. \u201c Everything. I want to be the richest, to be the desire of millions. I want it all. \u201d \n \n \u201c Can do, buddy. Just need you to sign here. \u201d Gary said, pulling a clipboard out from nothingness. It was large, almost larger than himself, with an incredibly thick stack of papers. It looked more like Steve was purchasing several homes, rather than simply summoning a demon to provide him with unlimited riches. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s this? \u201d Steve said. \n \n \u201c Basic T \u2019 s and C \u2019 s. You know, terms. Keeps liability off Satan, few safety wavers to make sure you don \u2019 t blame us if you hurt yourself, cancellation agreement, one or two dozen torture things, and a small clause about selling your soul to us for all of eternity. Nothing weird. You can just sign on the first page. \u201d \n \n \u201c And then I get the money? \u201d Steve said. He turned and began rummaging through the desk drawer behind him for a pen, not waiting for a response. \n \n \u201c Sure, \u201d Gary said. \u201c You sign this, you get the money. \u201d \n \n Steve turned around, a small, blue Bic pen in hand. \u201c Give me it, \u201d he said, reaching his hand out toward the contract. Gary handed smiled and thrust the clipboard toward him. Steve grabbed it, flipped it over, and quickly scribbled his name across dotted line, then handed it back. \n \n \u201c Great! \u201d Gary said. \u201c Perfect. \u201d \n \n \u201c Give me my money now. I want it all. \u201d \n \n \u201c Sure thing, champ, \u201d Gary said, walking toward Steve. His hand was outstretched, the small, brown bag in his upturned palm. He pushed it into Steve \u2019 s hand. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s this? \u201d Steve said, pulling on the strings at its top to open it up. \n \n \u201c The money, \u201d Gary said. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s all in here? \u201d Steve glanced inside. What appeared to be several quarters, pennies, dimes, and nickels sat inside. \u201c This is like $ 1.45. \u201d \n \n \u201c Wow, good guess. It \u2019 s $ 1.43. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t get it, \u201d Steve said. \u201c Where \u2019 s my riches? My wealth? \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s in that bag, \u201d Gary said. \u201c It \u2019 ll always be in the bag. Check it out. \u201d Gary grabbed the bag and emptied it onto the floor, then handed it back to Steve. It was still full. Steve glanced inside. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s still $ 1.43 in there, \u201d he said, now looking at the $ 1.43 in coins on the floor. \n \n \u201c Yeah, you \u2019 ll always have $ 1.43 in there. That \u2019 s what it caps out at. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t understand, you \u2019 re the Demon of Patron Wealth. This isn \u2019 t wealth. This is pocket change. I sold you my soul, where is my money? My riches? \u201d \n \n \u201c What? Demon of Patron We\u2014oh. See, you got the wrong guy. I \u2019 m the Demon of Loose Change. Happens all the time, \u201d Gary said, laughing. \u201c Honestly, just last week some guy in Australia did the same thing. He had a better accent, though. \u201d \n \n Steve glanced down at the bag. A limitless source of $ 1.43. Maybe he could just tip it over and spill it on the floor all day\u2014but then he'd have to transport hundreds of tons of coins to the bank. Steve let out a long, heavy sigh. It was going to be a long eternity. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ EU ] After Krypton 's destruction , Kal-el ends up landing somewhere other than the United States .\n","story":"In the 1950s, the Soviet Union reveals its newest asset to be Superman. The sudden revelation of a superpowered alien under Soviet control causes panic in the United States, shifting the focus of the Cold War arms race from nuclear weapons to superhumans. CIA agent James Olsen recruits Lex Luthor, a scientist employed by S.T.A.R. Labs, to destroy Superman. Luthor's first act is to cause Sputnik 2 to plummet towards Metropolis. After Superman diverts the satellite away from the city, Luthor retrieves his genetic material and creates a clone of Superman whom Lex Luthor officially names Superman 2 when he is unveiled to Olsen. The clone's appearance is monstrous, and is this world's equivalent to Bizarro. \n Meanwhile, Superman meets Wonder Woman at a diplomatic party, and she becomes smitten by him. Pyotr Roslov, the head of the NKVD and Joseph Stalin's illegitimate son, is angry that Superman has turned his father's attention away from him and ended his chances of advancement within the Soviet regime. Pyotr shoots a dissident couple in front of their son for printing anti-Superman propaganda. Stalin dies from cyanide poisoning, and Superman initially refuses command of the Communist Party. However, a chance meeting with Lana Lazarenko, his childhood sweetheart, changes his mind. Superman chooses to use his powers for the greater good and turn his country into a utopia. \n \n The U.S. government sends Bizarro to engage Superman, and their duel causes an accidental nuclear missile launch in Great Britain. The clone sacrifices itself to save millions. Luthor murders his research staff at S.T.A.R Labs and funds LuthorCorp, dedicating his life to destroying Superman. \n \n By 1978, the United States is on the verge of social collapse whereas the prosperous Soviet Union has peacefully expanded its influence to nearly every corner of the globe. The cost of this progress is an increased infringement on individual liberties, with Superman fast becoming a Big Brother-like figure; a brain surgery technique that turns dissidents into obedient drones, or `` Superman Robots'', is in use. Superman now works with Wonder Woman to save lives as well as govern the Soviet state. Wonder Woman has become enamored of Superman, but he considers her simply as a comrade, and is oblivious to her love for him. \n \n Luthor plans to shrink Moscow, but this plan fails when Brainiac, his collaborator, shrinks Stalingrad instead. Superman intervenes and retrieves both Brainiac's central processing unit and the tiny city, putting an end to the Brainiac-Luthor cooperation. He is unable to restore Stalingrad and its inhabitants to their proper size. This becomes his one failure and a source of great guilt. \n \n Luthor's second plan involves Batman, who is revealed as the boy orphaned by Pyotr. Batman joins forces with LuthorCorp and Pyotr, now head of the KGB. They capture Wonder Woman and use her as bait for Superman, hoping to sap his powers with rays that imitate the light of Superman's native sun. The plan works, but Wonder Woman breaks free and rescues Superman, seriously injuring herself. Rather than face capture and likely lobotomization, Batman commits suicide, and Pyotr is turned into a Superman Robot. \n \n Luthor enacts his third plan when he finds a mysterious green lantern found in an alien ship that crashed at Roswell, New Mexico. Brainiac is reprogrammed into Superman's aide, and the construction of a Fortress of Solitude, located in Siberia and referred to as `` The Winter Palace'', begins. Superman's reign continues with no crime, poverty, or unemployment, but with an ever-present state authority. Superman is committed to `` winning the argument'' with the U.S., and repeatedly refuses Brainiac's suggestions of an invasion. Stalingrad remains his one failure, now contained within a protective glass `` bottle''. \n \n Luthor is elected President of the United States, with Olsen as his Vice President. Using his scientific expertise, massive economic capital and dictatorial powers, Luthor returns prosperity to his country. This is only a part of a more general plan to provoke Superman into invading the United States. Luthor shows Olsen two of his greatest discoveries: the Phantom Zone, a place that super-hearing can not reach; and the Green Lantern Corps. \n \n Luthor confronts Superman in the Winter Palace. Brainiac yanks Luthor deep into the recesses of the Fortress to be converted surgically into a Superman Robot, claiming that Lex would convince Superman to commit suicide in less than fourteen minutes. Superman agrees that his hand has been forced, and prepares to attack. \n \n First Lady Lois Luthor visits Themyscira to forge an alliance with the Amazon empire, now ruled by an embittered and vengeful Wonder Woman. Superman attacks the East Coast, confronting and defeating the Green Lantern Marine Corps, which is led by Colonel Hal Jordan. The Amazon forces, commanded by Wonder Woman, attack Superman but are quickly defeated, along with a collection of `` super-menaces'' ( including Atomic Skull, Parasite and Doomsday ) that Luthor has put together over the years. Brainiac's spaceship cuts the U.S. Pacific fleet to pieces, and the two superbeings meet at the White House. They are greeted by Lois Luthor with the last weapon, a small note written by Lex that reads, `` Why do n't you just put the whole world in a bottle, Superman?'' \n \n Realizing he has meddled in affairs that he had no place in, Superman orders Brainiac to end the invasion. Brainiac, however, reveals it has never been under Superman's control, and instead attacks Superman with green radiation ( analogous to green kryptonite ). Braniac is shut down from inside by Luthor, who evaded surgery. As the singularities powering Brainiac's ship threaten to collapse, Superman rockets it into space, where it explodes. The Earth is saved, but Superman is thought dead. \n \n The Soviet Union falls into chaos, but is soon brought back under control thanks to the Batmen ( resistance members who began wearing the costume after Batman's death ). Lex Luthor integrates many of Superman's and Braniac's ideas into the new philosophy of `` Luthorism'' and forms a `` Global United States''. This becomes the defining moment for mankind's future as it enters an unprecedented age of peace and stability. A benevolent world government is formed and maintained. Luthor presides over a string of scientific achievements, including the curing of all known disease, and colonization of the solar system. Luthor lives for over one thousand years. \n \n At Luthor's funeral, it is revealed that Superman survived the explosion of Brainiac's ship and is apparently immortal. Superman attends the funeral wearing a business suit and thick glasses essentially identical to the appearance of Clark Kent, an identity he never adopted in the Red Son storyline. Luthor's widow, Lois, sees `` Clark'' in the crowd and, other than an eerie sense of deja vu, suspects nothing. Superman walks quietly away from the ceremony, planning to live among humans rather than ruling over them. \n \n Billions of years in the future, it is revealed that Earth is being torn apart by tidal stresses from the sun, which has become a red giant. Luthor's distant descendant, Jor-L, sends his infant son, Kal-L, rocketing back into the past. The final panels of the comic book depict the landing of Kal-L's timeship in a Ukrainian collective in 1938, effectively causing a predestination paradox.\n"}

I'm not a Pony I thought - I am Stephen, I have a job, I have a wife, I own a Jet-ski. I knew Pony's most definitely did not own Jet-ski's. \n \n Ok, so something was clearly amiss.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar 's body . The bigger the lie , the deeper and larger the mark . One day , you meet someone that only has one scar ; it is the biggest one you have ever seen .\n","story":"You do n't often see scars on people's faces. They only appear there with the most transparent of lies, lies that can be seen through in an instant. I have only ever met one person with a scar on their face and I doubt that I will ever be able to forget them. \n \n Her name was Quincy, and the first time I saw her was when she walked into my high school chemistry class halfway through senior year. At that point, her scar was small, a scratch on her cheek. That day it was still bleeding. Before then, I always worked alone as our class had an odd number of students and there were always complaints about groups of three being unfair. When Quincy showed up, I finally had a lab partner. She did n't talk much, and when she did it was in a quiet voice with only the slightest trace of some accent that I could n't quite place. Another odd thing I noticed as we worked together was that she had no scars on her hands or her legs, at least not any that were visible. She was an anomaly to say the least. \n \n As time passed, our friendship grew and so did Quincy's scar. I earned my fair share of small nicks on my hands, lying about my grades being fine and my homework being done, the normal sort of things that teenagers would lie about, but I never earned a scar on my face. Every day, I would ask Quincy how she was doing, and she would always smile brightly at me and respond with `` I'm vertical and ventilating! How are you?'' It was another odd detail about her, one that I could n't quite figure out. \n \n That second half of the school year flew by, and graduation eventually came. Quincy had never spoken about college, so I had accepted that we probably would n't see each other after that final ceremony. I so desperately wanted to ask about her scar, which had grown the whole way from her chin to her eyebrow on the right side of her face. It was oddly shaped too, there were patches of clear skin in it, as though several lies had formed into one. I did n't get to ask Quincy about her scar that day. She did not come to graduation, opting to have her diploma mailed to her rather than walking the stage. We had never exchanged phone numbers, and she made no attempts to stay in touch over the summer. When the day came for me to finally move into my dorm, I had come to terms with the fact that I would never know about Quincy's mysterious scar. At this point, I wish I had been correct. \n \n The first day of classes, I had a writing course that all freshmen were required to take. I arrived very early and got a seat in the front of the room. Not two minutes later, the seat next to me squeaked backwards and a familiar voice asked me how my day was. I turned to answer Quincy, ecstatic that we had met again, but her appearance made me pause. She had shaved her hair on the right side of her head, and her scar had climbed almost to reach the peak of it. When I paused, she looked away, ashamed. I told her I was doing well, and when I returned the question she surprised me with a new answer. She was doing awful, she told me, her aunt that had taken her in when her parents passed had gotten into a bad car accident and died along with her two children. I offered my condolences, but Quincy just smiled sadly and turned away. \n \n Our friendship continued, we studied together often, and she helped edit my papers. I found out that she wanted to be a writer and had been too afraid to tell me because of the reactions she had gotten from other people. We started dating over the summer between freshman and sophomore years. Quincy's scar was still growing, and it scared me, but I loved her. \n \n One day, we were meant to go to the movies together, but she had a tendency to forget plans, especially when they were made in the spur of the moment. I showed up at her apartment. She rented a loft in a larger home. I let myself in and could immediately tell that something was wrong. Quincy loved animals, and had opted to live an extra twenty minute walk away from most of her classes just to find an apartment where she could get a dog. Her German Shepherd's name was Sonia, and she was quite excitable, but the house was dead silent when I walked in. I did a quick search of the house, going out into the backyard where Sonia spent most of her day when it was nice out. The poor thing had chewed her way into the plastic shed and eaten antifreeze. She had died in her favorite spot under a tree. I turned back into the house and started up the stairs, tentatively calling for Quincy. When I reached the ladder to the loft, I could hear a soft dripping noise. I quickly climbed the ladder and pushed open the hatch to the loft. The dripping was louder. \n \n Quincy was dangling from a rope tied to the rafters in the middle of her loft. The dripping was coming from the now gaping wound on her face. I have never seen a lie cut so deeply, but this one had cut her the whole way down to the bone. It was when I tore my eyes away from the gruesome sight of Quincy that I finally knew what lie had eaten away at her for all these years. On the wall opposite her, jaggedly carved into the wood paneling were two words: \n \n I'm fine.\n"}

He looked a little young to be a wizard, but he had the bearing of one. Stage magicians could be rather uptight as well, though. I tried to probe a little more. `` Do you mean interesting magic tricks, or, you know, *interesting* ones?'' \n \n `` What? I mean, something you wo n't find in the first chapter of Baby's First Magic Tricks. Something I have n't seen before!'' \n \n `` Oh, we've got some of those.'' I began leading him to the non-magical side of the shop. `` The more advanced tricks are in this aisle. We have a magic hat that's really popular, there's a lot of tricks you can do with it, and it comes with a...'' \n \n `` *You! *'' Another customer had entered the store behind me. `` Are you the owner of this establishment?'' \n \n Oh crumbs. That guy was definitely a real wizard. He was wearing a robe, for one. I do n't know why, but most wizards just do n't bother with non-magical fashion. They wear robes, or elaborate waistcoats and dresses, or some other fashion that's from the 1800s at the latest. I guess when you have the power to bend reality to your will, you ca n't be caught dead in jeans and a T-shirt. \n \n I turned to greet him with a smile. `` Yes, that's me. How can I help you, sir?'' \n \n He was holding a black velvet bag with a silver drawstring. `` This Bottomless Bag you sold me is defective! I need you to...'' \n \n `` Yes, yes, I understand, come right this way and I'll see what I can do.'' Hopefully I could get him away from the mundane before he said something like `` cast a repair charm on it.'' \n \n We stepped back to the cash register and I took the bag from the customer's hands. `` What exactly is the problem with it?'' \n \n `` I put something in the bag, and now I ca n't get it out!'' \n \n I peered into the bag. The interior was pitch-dark, and when I stuck in a hand, I could n't feel anything inside. Maybe it really was bottomless. He obviously expected there was a way to get stuff back out of it, though. I'd need him to show me how. \n \n I handed the bag back to him. `` Can you try to get your item back, so I can see what's happening? What was in it, anyway?'' \n \n `` Just some writing supplies, thank god. A quill pen, inkwell, parchment...'' He reached into the bag. `` Quill. Pen. Quill pen. Writing utensil. Writing device made of a goose feather. Hello? Are you listening? *Retrievus Contentus! * Give me my pen back, you infernal sack!'' \n \n I nodded to myself. Apparently you were supposed to be able to say the name of an item and have it returned, but that feature was n't working. Unfortunately, I did n't have the foggiest idea on how to fix that. I'd have to fall back on my customer service tricks. \n \n `` I'm sorry, but I get these from another supplier.'' Obviously, since I did n't have any magic of my own. `` I could exchange it for you, and I can repay your losses if it's still under warranty. Did you keep the receipt?'' \n \n He handed over a scrap of parchment, and I scrutinized it carefully. Not just because I wanted to check the warranty; the receipt could provide a lot of clues once you knew how the magic shop's inventory system worked. The wizard who used to own the place put an `` Accountant's Helper'' charm on the cash register and record books, which recorded exactly what was bought and sold in the store. It meant that I had to do the record books with parchment and ink, but the scanning magic it used could reveal details I did n't even know about. \n \n Case in point: The receipt listed the bag the customer had bought as an `` Actually Bottomless Bag with Portal Retrieval and Password Protection.'' That made things clear enough. \n \n `` Aha! I know what the issue is. This was a *genuine* bottomless bag, not a bag of holding. It's a little confusing, since they're both commonly called bottomless bags.'' I hoped that was true. I had a bit of a sense for how magic worked, but I still had to do a lot more guesswork than I was comfortable with. \n \n `` Really? What's the difference?'' \n \n `` A bag of holding simply has an Extension Charm inside of it to carry more items. It still has a bottom, it's just farther away than it should be. A *bottomless* bag uses a spatial loop to remove the bottom completely. You put an object inside and it falls forever, like it's in a bottomless pit.'' \n \n `` Oh, I see! So it can hold an infinite amount of items. And it uses a portal spell to retrieve the items on demand?'' \n \n I nodded. Looks like my guess was right. `` You've got it, sir. But this model of bottomless bag has a Password Charm on it, so someone ca n't steal your items. Do you know what the password is?'' \n \n `` No! I never set a password on this stupid thing!'' \n \n `` Must have happened by accident.'' \n \n `` So how am I suppose to get my things back? Is there a way to reset the password?'' \n \n I shrugged. `` I do n't know, I lost the instructions scroll. But since it's like a bottomless pit, I suspect you might have a simple solution.'' \n \n `` What's that?'' \n \n `` Turn it upside down and wait for your stuff to fall out again.'' \n \n `` Does that really work?'' He turned the bag upside down, but looked skeptical. \n \n `` It should. It would be weird if gravity stopped working inside that bag. I mean, you'd notice something strange when you put your hand inside. It would n't feel like it was still on Earth.'' \n \n `` I suppose you're right.'' \n \n We sat there in silence for a few seconds, waiting for something to happen. The mundane customer paid for the magic hat and left, apparently not noticing or not caring that a man in wizard's robes was intently starting at an upside-down velvet bag. Good, that could have been a mess. \n \n Then a thought occurred to me. `` Oh, you might want to put a Cushioning Charm down, or else...'' \n \n An inkwell came out of the mouth of the bag at terminal velocity, smashing on the floor and spraying ink across the linoleum and splattering on the hem of his robes. \n \n ``... Yeah, that might happen. Sorry about that.''\n"}

Each one was its own special hue of technicolor, in some sort of morbid attempt to brighten up our dreary days. \n \n I yanked off my grey pullover and used a sleeve to mop my brow. I was sweating everywhere, both from the effort, and from the shock. I heard Steve pad in from the living room, some reality trashvert about pregnant transexuals with learning disabilities blaring behind him. He was wearing a matching version of my same government-issued leisure outfit, with a few additions of some foodstains the laundromatic could n't seem to remove. \n \n He surveyed my workspace. The soft greys of the cabinets, the hydration station, and the food storage-box all happened to have somehow been smeared with equal parts of most of our food allotment for the month. The effect of the colors-on-grey almost hurt the eyes. \n \n `` What... what the smeg are you doing?'' \n \n I smiled broadly as I flourished my hands towards the only clean plate on the eating table. \n \n `` What is THAT?'' He stared, eyes agog, at my masterpiece. The pinnacle of my efforts. My life, given meaning. \n \n `` It's dinner. It's something I made. I want you to try some.'' \n \n He stared at the plate, confused. \n \n I sorted, scavenged, and traded with my friends at the WorKamp. I tested dozens upon dozens of all the various types and flavors of every foodstuff I could find. Festival KRAK-L-SNAPS. Breakfast DUST-EEZ. Sunday Bruncheon FLIP-WIFFZ. I was a man possesed. \n \n Each one? The same. Grind it up, dry it out ( if wet ), and you ended up with a powder that although looked a different color from the others, but when blindfolded? Nobody could tell them apart. All was EZ-PASTEE. EZ-PASTEE was all. \n \n They thought I was crazy. I probably was. Best not let the docs at WorKamp find out. \n \n `` Okay... I get it. It's food. But... what's... What's wrong with it?'' He sounded incredulous. Possibly frightened. I hoped not frightened. \n \n \n `` Well, it's simple, you see. I figured it out. I figured out what's missing.'' \n \n He absentmindedly plucked a half-eaten bag of NIBZ-N-BITZ from his pocket, upending it into his mouth, and then tossing the empty bag behind him, his eyes never leaving my dish. I frowned, but continued. \n \n `` This? This is the future. This is exactly what I've been talking about.'' \n \n He walked towards the table, and leaned down towards my creation. He sniffed. \n \n `` It smells... weird. Like... real weird.'' \n \n `` I know, right? That's part of the amazingness of it all.'' I found myself giddy with excitement. `` This is something *different*. This is something *new*. I've looked up things on the Infonet. Nobody has ever thought of or heard of such a thing. I'm some sort of scientist... inventor!'' \n \n I stared at him as he stared at the food. I found that by simply adding a few household items here and there, i could change the consistency of the powder. Adding water or drying it changed the texture. Doing both? The sky was the limit. Plus, of course, a special addition I found one day walking home from the WorKamp when I was late and missed the hovershuttle. Ah yes, my muse, so to speak. \n \n \n He sniffed it again, less politely. `` What's wrong with it?'' \n \n I glared. `` Nothing is wrong with it. Everything is RIGHT with it.'' \n \n He sat, sliding the dish towards himself. \n \n `` I think it's wrong. i think it's poison. Is it poison? Is this because of the mess? I told you I'd clean it up after my show...'' He trailed off, and suddenly clapped his hands to his mouth. \n \n My smile returned, brighter and bigger than before. This is when I knew it worked. \n \n `` ERT ERZ PURZURHN!!!'' \n \n I cocked an eyebrow. \n \n He got the point and loosened the grip on his mouth. \n \n `` I said, it IS poison! My mouth is getting all... wrong!'' \n \n I nodded profusely. \n \n `` What did you do to me?'' \n \n I shook my head. `` I did n't do anything. IT did it. The food did. Is your mouth all full of slobber now?'' \n \n He nodded, eyes looking slightly horrified. \n \n `` Perfect! Perfect!'' I rubbed my hands together with glee. `` Now to see if step two occurs!'' \n \n `` Stehp terr?'' He readjusted his hands again. `` Step two? What is step two?'' \n \n And as if on cue, despite both of us having had our full ration at darktime ( and him? Then some, the gluttonous slob! ), a noise was heard. As if someone fell into a three-meter deep vat of EZ-PASTEE. \n \n His eyes nearly blew out of their sockets as he clutched his stomach. `` WHAT IS GOING ON?'' he yelped. \n \n I leaned in close. `` You, my poor slobby roommate? You sir, are hungry. Hungry for this.'' And slid the plate closer. \n \n I learned much from the Infonet, and my own experimentation. Whatever it truly was they made food out of, I had no clue. But what I did know is that with those right additions, it was infinitely malleable. Aerate it and dry it? Crunchy and light. Leave it in a mold and dry it? Crunchy and dense. Add water to the powder, and it became pasty, gooey, or runny, or even the same kind of liquid in the SUK-SNAK packages for when you were away from a hydration station and needed to quench your thirst. Emergency candles helped me warm and harden my experiments quickly, imparting its own strange flavor and mouthfeel. Adding just a bit of water, aerating, and putting that into a mold? Gave me a strange sort of textured light slab that seemed to go well with my extra ingredients. Once I figured it all out, it was all a matter of getting everythign down to the right consistencies in the right shapes and using the flames of the candles to do the hard part. \n \n And the best thing? No the worst thing? \n \n My extra ingredients did n't come from a tube, or a box, or a bag. I just FOUND them! \n \n I watched him as he almost visibly weighed his options. \n \n `` So,'' I began, `` would you like to try?'' \n \n He looked at the dish, the food on it, at me, and back again. \n \n I stood there a while. Eventually, he came to a decision, and nodded slowly. \n \n He picked up my experiment, something I decided to call on the spot a'handheld'. It made sense at the time. I quickly showed him how to pick it up, and hold it in his hands, and how to convey it to his mouth. I reflected back to the scene I came across on that fateful day last week as I showed him how it worked. The darker mud-colored slabs worked well to keep ones fingers clean. Some seeds I had scavenged from a plant added some sort of strange yet delightful mouth feeling to them. Their aeration also acted as a sponge of sorts, which was useful, as I had coated the center with a concoction consisting of most of the rest of the plant. Individually, they caused the mouth to nearly sing with delight, but together? Oh they were simply *joyous! * \n \n `` What... what do I do? Like... like this?'' He made a horrible attempt at first, almost ruining my design. The mouth is horizontal! The food must be held as such! You do n't need a squeeze tube or a cello-pak to eat this! Eat it like a real human, with your hands and mouth! \n \n `` No no, just like this.'' I pantomimed the motion, hoping he would n't spill it, or worse, try to eat each individual bit of this stack separately. Why... why... that would destroy the point! \n \n He figured out eventually what I meant and was poised to devour the foodstack... no, my handheld. They might think I was crazy, what with the mixing of outside elements into the food. I know, I know... I hear all the stories about the phages and the rads and the microbes, but the proof is right there! It works, and it is AMAZING! \n \n He paused. `` Are you sure it's not poison?'' \n \n `` Promise. Already had three in the last few days getting the proportions down right. Still having BMs like normal, and I feel healthy as ever!'' \n \n That seemed to allay all his fears and suspicions. A bit of confusion flittered across his face as he grew accustomed to eating it, but I could tell from his first full bite, and then the chewing afterward that he was in his own private ecstasy. \n \n `` Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmm'' \n \n I gasped. `` Oh drells... Are you okay, Steve?'' \n \n His eyes stayed closed as he chewed slowly, continuing to make the noise. \n \n `` Steve???'' \n \n His eyes slowly opened. `` This... this is so, so, so very smegging good.'' \n \n I could n't help but clap my hands in happiness. He devoured the rest of the handheld, and to my dismay, was licking the remnants off his filthy fingers. \n \n `` More. I need more, man. We need more.'' \n \n I stopped. This was the moment of truth. The point where men were separated from the sheep. \n \n `` I'll need your help for that, Steve.'' \n \n `` Okay, just tell me what was in it? I've never tasted anything like that before in my entire life. You... you could be RICH, like Ultraluxe rich!'' \n \n I nodded, and knew it was time. Everything was falling into place. I picked up a small bag and removed the contents and placed them on the table. \n \n His eyes glanced at each item in turn. Items I stole from or created and smuggled out of the WorKamp. Hammer. Chisel. Saw. Two extremely large knives. \n \n `` What you ate? Lucy, from block 38. She committed suicide right in front of me. Could n't stop it. But, she's gone now, and what I was able to take from her you ate the last of. Now, do you want to help me get more, or do you want that to be the last time your mouth will ever be happy for the rest of your smegging life?'' \n \n He looked pained. Frightened. Awed. Shaken. He stared at me, at the clean parts of his recently licked hands, the plate, and then me again. \n \n His looked turned to hunger, and he nodded. I smiled in turn, packed the tools up, shook his hand, and began to explain my plan. \n \n\n"}

A little bit dark but if it all went down hill I could always bury it in the garden in the back. Lord knows it was already a pit of death the way I've been treating it.

The person who just jumped out of a coffin was a 28 year old woman of medium build who made a habit of wearing pastel colors and plaid everywhere, was n't ashamed of a little cat hair, and was wearing an eyepatch. \n \n Wearing is n't the right word. I noticed pretty quickly that it was actually a piece of notebook paper that had been colored black with a sharpie and tapped over one eye. I wanted to ask about it but was immediately faced with a question of my own. \n \n `` Are you ready to lose your virginity?'' Jovially chimed the other me. \n \n I stood there. This is n't an offer that comes up a lot for me. \n \n `` Come on, I know just how you like it. I've been looking to get it on with someone myself and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.'' \n \n `` What happened to your eye?''

I was biding for time at this point. \n \n `` Thanks, I found it under the bed. I can show you where after you lead me up there.'' The sentence ended on a much high note than it started. \n \n `` No thanks.'' Barely a whisper. \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` I'm not a lesbian.'' \n \n `` So? Neither am I, it's not gay if you're having sex with yourself.'' \n \n `` I'm not attracted to you.'' \n \n `` Oh, it's the eye patch is n't it. Here.'' She tore the eye patch away. Now she looked just like me but with more of a libido. \n \n `` No, it's not the eye patch.'' \n \n `` Low self-esteem? I know I've dealt with that in the past-'' \n \n `` Is there a return to sender or-'' \n \n `` And I learned to love myself.'' \n \n `` Am I stuck with this?'' \n \n `` Pardon?'' \n \n `` You should leave.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' \n \n `` Yeah.'' \n \n `` I really thought I'd be coming rather than going.'' \n \n `` Yeah.'' \n \n `` You know, it's not a crime to love yourself.'' \n \n `` I'll remember that.'' \n \n `` I'll keep in touch.'' \n \n She left the coffin that day.

I poured the last of the other, a bottle of 50-year-old scotch that I'd bought ten years ago. When the genie had asked for my first wish, it'd been a no-brainer. We were well off, but Lanie always dreamed of pearls and Ferraris, and I just knew the boys, the prodigies that they were, would make it into the best -- the most expensive -- universities. \n \n So I asked for money, and the genie granted it, and two years later, when the feds busted down my door and waved warrants in my face, I saw the other side of the wish. Nothing comes for free, even magic; the paper trail linking me to embezzlement was long, solid, and it put me behind bars. \n \n I was huddled in the corner of my cell, years into my sentence, when the genie came calling again. It was dark, and all I could think about were the pearls draped over Lanie's neck, and the laughter of my boys, and the way the wind graced the tips of the grass in my yard. I just wished to see my family again. I should've thought about it more. I realized my mistake the moment the words left my lips. \n \n I only saw them through a technicality -- a clerical error that sent the three of them to my prison for a day while the state figured out how the hell it happened. I did n't bother asking what they were in for -- I just hugged Lanie, tight as a blanket on a frigid night, and I kissed my boys' foreheads, and after that day I knew I'd never see them again. \n \n When I got out, I did n't look for news of my family. I did n't have to. When the genie came calling for one final wish, its sardonic grin told me enough. Now it sat before me in what used to be Lanie's favorite chair, and when it folded its shimmering golden fingers across its knee, I could hear its bones crack. \n \n `` I want you to feel this pain,'' I growled. `` I want you to know what it's like. Just once. Just for a minute. I want you to be in my head.'' \n \n The genie laughed and waited for me to say the words. They had to be specific. I downed the last of the scotch and glared up into the soulless abyss of its eyes. \n \n `` I wish you were inside me. I wish you could feel my pain. For just one minute, I wish you and I were the same being.'' \n \n It laughed again; its voice boomed off the walls and then it vanished.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] An alien race encounters the most terrifying predator imaginable . A lone , unarmed human .\n","story":"* *Translated from the logs of the KRIKNETSH Fleet, Scientific Outpost 2.1.38976.2, TRIVIN Era* \n \n We'd never imagined the beast would be so resourceful. It was squishy, pink, and it did n't even have an exoskeleton. Like one of our young, it lacked a proper defense from the elements. But we were wrong. When we first encountered it, it was lost, naked, scared, and weak with malnourishment. We thought it needed our help. We never could have predicted its ruthless spirit. \n \n We convinced it to follow us, to come to our encampment, where we gave it a youth's suit to put on. The suit was like a mock exoskeleton until our young's flesh grew hard enough to do without. Of course, we had to configure it to accommodate those strangely jointed limbs it had, but that was a small matter, the Nurser had seen some strange mutations in their time, and made short work of the matter. \n \n Once it was suited, we took it to Medical to understand its biology, as best as our field systems could allow us. It turned out it could eat just about anything living and carbon based, provided they were n't caustic in nature. But for liquids it needed a di-hydrogen-oxygen compound that we could synthesize, but at great cost. We would need to convert an entire tank of our much heavier fluids, just to get a small storage that it could quaff from. Its body was comprised of much of the same, if only at a cellular level. It obviously needed the fluid to survive for even a short amount of time. We estimated it could last 7 cycles without. \n \n We thought it strange that it needed to ingest nourishment through the crazy bone-protrusion-lined orifice that it made noises, and breathed from. It seemed really inefficient, but when after its initial apprehension at sampling our provisions for it, it quickly devoured all it could see. Such strange biology. The limb that carried that orifice also seemed to be where it kept most of its sensory tissues and held a large nerve tissue cluster. We figured this is where its thought-patterns would originate from, if it had any. \n \n Things were okay for a couple of cycles, we ran tests to confirm its level of intelligence, finding out that it could manipulate very small object in significant ways with its oddly shaped tentacles on the end of its limbs, much in the same way the small tactile tentacles we grew as our exoskeleton hardened, so we too could manipulate the environment. It seemed fairly inefficient to only be able to hold two tools at once though. \n \n We'd made progress getting responses and communicating simple ideas, when Sciencer dictated we should see if the Interlink Thought Hoop would allow us to directly communicate with its mind. \n \n That was where we went wrong. Reflecting back, it was with this moment that we now know and understand the thought-pattern Fear, and where its intellect and ruthless ability to adapt and survive became deadly to us. \n \n Lacking a proper [ Kizzzzthk ] to place the hoop on, we placed it just below the bulbous limb that housed its largest nerve cluster. It did n't like that at all. We were blasted with a sense that we did n't understand initially, and we later came to understand that our device allowed it to hunt us. \n \n It had a hunger unlike anything we could have imagined, and it was not a hunger for sustenance, but violence. Our placid nature just made it want to take advantage of us further, and it probed our thoughts much more deeply than we could it. Its complex nerve cluster was so well protected telepathically we only got surface thoughts as they were happening and being acted on. We could not grasp any complex processes that led to these, but we could sense a deeper thought-system at work. \n \n As if this was n't negative enough, it began to test the device and use it like any other tool, manipulating our thought-forms, extracting information, and even hurting some of our weak. We thought it was accidental, and surely it would show the same peaceful intentions we had once it got the hang of using the device. Oh.. How we were wrong. We'd given it exactly what it wanted, a way off of this rock, and a chance to hunt us down. \n \n It grasped a few thought-forms from Guard that directly translated: Prisoner. Escape. Danger. Defiant. Killer. Abandon. Punish. \n \n It was n't here by accident and helpless.. It had been abandoned here as punishment for its actions. \n \n Then it began forcing the thought-form of Pain on us. One by one, overcoming our senses, punishing us with our own device. It then fashioned tools from our technology, understanding so much quicker the intricacies needed to operate them. It took blades for exoskeleton scraping and cleaning, turned them on our flesh, eviscerating our organs. \n \n Guard had stumbled too close, and dropped the beam-projector into range when the beast had struck out with a thought-form-pain spike. It easily adapted its tiny-tentacle limbs to wield the defense tool and turned it on Guard as its first target, boiling the flesh into particles. Then made a most horrendous noise of Joy. We can only surmise that because of the thought we got from it was... Pleasure. \n \n Not Enjoy. Not Happy. Those were part of it, though. Pleasure. Release. Reproduction. These drove it to kill more of us. It wanted fulfillment of these thought-patterns again and again. We could n't stop it. It tore its way through almost all fifty or us, cutting us apart, burning our flesh, each time getting a reproductive pleasure burst, which excited it to keep going. \n \n Nurser and Recorder [ ME\/I\/MYSELF ] made our way to the emergency escape pods, and that was only after much evasion during all the confusion. We had to remove our hoops and use purely physical signals to make our way to the pod, lest the beast track us with the hoop. We never imagined the device could be manipulated that way. Researchers will be examining this information for hundreds of cycles to figure out how it did it. \n \n But for now we are safe. The beast probably made its way to one of the pods and found its way back to where ever it came from. We managed to go through the files and picked up a few thought-patterns unintentionally recorded on the hoops. First, it called itself [ HUMAN ]. Secondly, this [ HUMAN ] was what it called [ FEMALE ]. \n \n We all conceded that if this was the reproducing side of their species, we want nothing to do with them. Universe help us if we ever encounter another. \n \n *End entry. * \n *Further information and protocols can be found in Database, under [ HUMAN ]. *\n"}

They would pass him without acknowledgment, and his eyes would drift back to the empty coffee cup at his feet. He would tense his empty stomach and do his best to ignore the pangs of hunger. Then he would start to drift off again, until the next group of affluents exited a pub and made their way down the street. \n \n After many hours, Marcus realized that sleep would be impossible. He straightened his back, and began counting the cycles of traffic on the corner. Red light, pedestrians walk. The crossing signal began to flash, and then became a solid red hand. The cars in the turning lane went, and then the light turned green, then yellow, and the cycle repeated. Eventually, fewer pedestrians were at the crosswalk, fewer cars waited for the light and then sped through at their first chance. More people left the pubs than went in, and eventually, the pubs began to lock their doors and switch off their lights for the night. \n \n Marcus had just watched the traffic light progress through a full cycle without anyone, motorist or pedestrian, to use it, when he heard the door open and the laughter of a group of friends as they exited a restaurant. He glanced up the street at them. College aged, maybe. Everyone looked young to Marcus, even those who might have been a few years older than him. \n \n The party spent a minute or two chatting at the entrance to the restaurant, and then they disbanded into two groups. Three of the women walked in a pack towards Marcus. His head dipped back into his knees. \n \n Suddenly, a voice from down the street, \u201c Alright, you two. Good night! \u201d \n \n \u201c Hey, be safe sweetheart. Good night. \u201d \n \n Marcus \u2019 s eyes shot up to see one of the women detach from her posse and continue in his direction while the other two crossed the street. As she strode past him, he sized her up. She wore what Marcus could only assume was an expensive skirt and blouse. Her feet clicked on the pavement in heeled shoes. From the depths of her purse, he heard the jingle of loose change, suggesting that she carried larger denominations of cash. She ignored Marcus and continued alone down the vacant street. \n \n Marcus reached for his bag and felt through the spare set of clothes and sundry items he carried with him. His fingers closed upon a small knife. The pain in his stomach flared violently for a moment, and then contracted to a point. Marcus stood, palmed the knife and slung the bag over his shoulder. \n \n The woman made her way through the city streets. Marcus trailed her, perhaps a block behind, waiting for a good window to open. They passed other pedestrians, cars, and as they approached a major motorway, a barrage of sound and people. They crossed the boulevard, and continued into a relatively empty residential neighborhood. Encouraged by their isolation, Marcus increased his pace. The woman glanced behind her. Her steps increased in frequency and she hunched her shoulders, lowering her eyes. Marcus was almost jogging at this point. The woman looked back again, and suddenly darted down a side street. Marcus closed the gap between himself and her. \n \n As he rounded the corner, he saw her, still trying to get away, but now less than thirty feet from him. Marcus suddenly realized that he had not expected his plan to get this far. None the less, he couldn \u2019 t back out now. He sprinted towards her, and shouted, \u201c Hey! Stop! I \u2019 ve got a knife. \u201d \n \n The woman spun around with a terrified look in her eyes. She widened her stance and reached for her purse. \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t move! Gim me the purse and you can go home without getting hurt, \u201d Marcus shouted as he brandished the knife. \n \n The woman hesitated, then began to slide her hand towards the pocket of her purse. \n \n \u201c No, just take it off. Put it on the ground. I will fucking kill you if you don \u2019 t! \u201d Marcus stepped forward as the woman pulled a can of mace from her purse. \n \n The knife dropped as Marcus \u2019 s hands flew to his burning eyes. He let out a guttural scream. The woman took several steps back and cried for help. \n \n \u201c Please! Someone call the police. I \u2019 m being robbed! \u201d \n \n Marcus squinted with glazed vision, and saw the purse hanging loosely from her shoulder. \n \n \u201c Fucking bitch, cunt, \u201d he screamed as he lunged for the bag. He grabbed her by the throat with one hand and snatched at the bag with the other. The woman threw her free arm forward, and her fist collided with Marcus \u2019 s sternum. \n \n He staggered back, unable to gasp for air. The woman crouched and launched a kick at the side of Marcus \u2019 s leg. His knee buckled, and his other leg collapsed under his weight. Marcus fell to his knees and looked up, only to see the woman \u2019 s knuckles fly towards his face. Marcus snapped back and his head landed hard on the concrete. Bright lights filled his vision and the world became\u2026 fuzzy. \n \n Through the daze, he heard the woman muttering, * \u201c What the fuck? Why? Why would you fucking do that? \u201d * Her voice stopped, and her steps reverberated in Marcus \u2019 s mind as she continued down the street. \n \n Marcus rolled onto his side and gagged on his own blood. He could n't move his left knee, so he pulled his right one to his chest and hugged it. When his breath returned, Marcus began to sob. Sappy, bloody bubbles formed in his nose and throat, and they popped along with the kaleidoscope that seared his eyelids. *Why? Why couldn \u2019 t she have just given him the fucking bag? * \n\n"}

She does n't like what he has become .\n","story":"Just a warning: it's pretty long. \n \n Alund stared at the tiny gem for what seemed ages. Within it swirled brilliant imperfections that never stopped changing, and it seemed that hidden amid that cloud there was a light as brilliant as the sun shining outward, creating an aura that could almost lift the stifling dark that surrounded him. At his feet lay the beast tasked with guarding the gem, slain after a long battle that claimed the life of his final companion. \n \n For months he had searched for this long lost crystal, a fragment of a much larger meteorite that had plummeted from the heavens. The great rock had destroyed much life upon shattering against the earth, and chaos had reigned for years as people went in search of the fragments. Great power was bestowed upon any who managed to find the crystals, and with this great power nations arose and were fell. Finally, after over a decade of turbulence, the Gods intervened and sealed the remaining pieces of the meteor in hidden locations all around the world. \n \n Now Alund held one such crystal in his hand, and he could feel the magic radiating into him. He closed his eyes, and it was like reading an instruction manual on how to use the stone. He simply understood, at his most basic of levels, how to make his wish come true. And so, with neither hesitation nor contemplation, he threw the crystal to the ground shattering it. \n \n And then Alund was in the sunlight. His eyes were still closed, but he could feel the warmth of the sun shining upon him. Between his fingers and under his palm he could feel warm grass, and in the distance there was a sound he'd not heard since he and his companions had set out on their long and arduous journey- laughter. \n \n In the shade of an oak tree he found his bride, as beautiful and seemingly untouched by time as she had been the day of their marriage. A dog sat beside her, licking at her hangs as she tried to pet him, sending her into fits of laughter every time. Then she looked up and saw Alund, and her laughter died in her throat. \n \n For the first time in months Alund truly looked at himself. Where once he wore simple farmer's cloth there now was cold steel. When he walked it was the slow saunter of killer, his hand never far from a properly aligned blade. He remembered vaguely that he had once worn his hair long and free, but now his head was shaved. And all over him was blood- blood that was not his. \n \n `` My love,'' He stammered as she gazed horrified up at him `` Is this real? Can it be true?'' \n \n Alund fell to his knees in front of her, his eyes already full of tears. \n \n `` I dare not touch you for fear that I dream, and the wanting for that dream to never fade.'' \n \n The horror faded to sadness, and from sadness to pity as realized what her love had become in her absence. When she spoke it was soft, a breeze rustling leaves and creating waves in the graze. \n \n `` This is no dream, though I realize now that I have been asleep for a long, long time. What have you done, my love, what have you done to become such a thing as this? What has our love endured for you to come to me in such a sorry state as this?'' \n \n The words stung. Alund had pictured the reuniting of their marriage as something magical, as a rekindling of their love. He stared at his hands, bound in cloth and metal and covered in cuts and callouses. When he looked back up at her there was no more oak tree, and the dog was gone. Now they were back in that dark pit he'd found the crystal in, but they were alone. No bodies lay anywhere near. \n \n `` I have endured hell to bring you back to earth. I banded with a company of strong, good men, and together we plunged into the den of the Gods themselves. I alone survived.'' \n \n She inched near him, seemingly oblivious to the changes in her environment. She drew one hand down his face, gently caressing him. \n \n `` I plunged into the abyss with only fear, only one *thought*: what would become of my beloved? And now I see my dear is gone. A hardened soldier sits in his stead, come to retrieve me for him. But that soldier has taken his place, has he not? Does the man I loved still live? How many died with him to lift my soul from the abyss of death?'' \n \n Alund did not answer. He knew that the scales were tipped the wrong way. He knew he had to balance them. He closed his eyes, and focused on her hand on his cheek, wondering why it was cold. Trying to remember if this is what it felt like before, and wondering why he felt so hollow after accomplishing so much. \n \n `` The power you used to bring me back... I know how grand that strength must be. I am not truly here, my love. Even if you brought me back I would be this forever, a spectre, an elfin fay forever wandering the worlds of man. And you would be my wraith. Never would we be happy. Never would the world be as it was before.'' \n \n `` But it *could be*'' he muttered back, eyes still closed. And even as he said them he knew they rang false. \n \n Alund opened his eyes and the world around him had become a graveyard. The stone in front of him was his wife's. All the way down the lane of headstones were names he recognized, friends that had fallen on the way to this conclusion. All dead. This is why the Gods had hidden the stones, to prevent the death and desolation that accompanied them as the greed and fear of men took hold of that power. \n \n But Alund knew he could stand above it. Knew that, with the words of his beloved ringing in his ears, he could make a positive impact on the world. Dead was dead, but there were thousands that yet lived. Hundreds that would die that he could save. The power of the crystal resonated inside of him, and he knew that it could be done. That he could be something great. \n \n So he left the armor where he'd been standing. Dropped the sword he had worn for so many months on his friend's grave. And started walking, hoping to answer some of the prayers that the God's so cruelly ignored. \n\n"}

It was a frigid day, and Terry could almost hear his chapped lips crack in the bitter winter air. He stepped into his car and pulled out his mobile phone. \n \n \u201c Call Sarah. \u201d \n \n \u201c Calling Sarah, mobile or home? \u201d \n \n \u201c Mobile. \u201d \n \n He pushed in the electric lighter in his car and pulled a Marlboro out of his pack, the heat had gone out of his car and his cigarette was the only warm thing about his drive home. \n \n \u201c Hello? \u201d \n \n \u201c Hey, it \u2019 s me. You cooking dinner? \u201d \n \n \u201c No, I didn \u2019 t have time to get to the store today. \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay then, I was wondering if you \u2019 d like to try something new today. Sully told me about a great new Thai place on the corner of Court St. \u201d \n \n \u201c Do you really think the kids are going to eat Thai? \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh it \u2019 s good for them, and Eric and Abby need to learn to appreciate different things, we can \u2019 t very well have spaghetti or chicken nuggets every night. \u201d \n \n \u201c Fine, but you have to drive. \u201d \n \n \u201c Fine by me, see you soon. Love you. \u201d \n \n He rounded a corner, and cracked his window. He didn \u2019 t want the car to smell like smoke; after all he had to set an example for Eric and Abby. \n \n He drew his last on the half finished cigarette before flicking it out the window. As he pulled in the drive he reached into the console, and pulled out an aerosol and quickly covered the scent. He idled in the driveway until he saw his wife open the door and his two children waddle outside, dressed as warm as marshmallows. \n \n Sarah sat the kids into the car, and then herself. She leaned over and pecked Terry on the cheek as he pulled out of the drive. \n \n It wasn \u2019 t long before they arrived at the new restaurant. The exterior was reminiscent of an oriental palace, and the parking lot was small but full. Terry smiled as his children marveled at the large decorative door that separated them from the warm restaurant inside. Terry opened the door and his wife and kids filed in. \n \u201c Welcome to Palm Thai, how many? \u201d \n \n \u201c Four please. \u201d \n \n \u201c Right this way. \u201d \n \n The kids led the way while he and Sarah followed behind.

Don \u2019 t be rude. \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s not rude. I \u2019 m impressed. \u201d \n \n Terry sighed as Sarah slid into the booth. They began looking over the menu, and they soon placed their order. The staff was incredibly friendly and even offered various samples. \n \n \u201c Try this, spicy egg roll with yummy sauce. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t want to! \u201d Abby cried. Sarah shot a glance toward her that was firm but loving. \n \n \u201c Abby dear, just eat it. Try something new I promise it \u2019 ll be delicious. \u201d She said as she dipped the roll in the sauce and took a bite. \n \n \u201c See, \u201d she began, \u201c it \u2019 s delicious! \u201d \n \n Abby looked wary but after Eric reached over and grabbed one of the egg rolls she decided she would too. Terry \u2019 s eyes were so intent on Abby and Eric he didn \u2019 t even notice his wife. \n \n \u201c Come on guys, go ahead. Eat it. \u201d Abby looked nervous and she looked up at her mother for reassurance. Her nervous face evolved into terror. \n \n \u201c Daddy, what \u2019 s mommy doing? \u201d \n \n Sarah \u2019 s face was red, almost purple and she was beginning to dry heave. \n \n \u201c Oh God, your epi-pen, where is your epi-pen Sarah? \u201d He grabbed, the waitress passing by, \u201c Are there peanuts in the yummy sauce? \u201d \n \n \u201c We cook everything in peanut oil, sir. \u201d \n \n \u201c Damn it, where \u2019 s the epi-pen Sarah? \u201d She pointed at her purse. Terry reached over and grabbed the purse and began digging through it wildly. \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s not in here. It \u2019 s not home is it? \u201d Sarah nodded in a panic. \n \n \u201c Put your coats on kids, we \u2019 re leaving. \u201d Terry hurried his kids and wife into the car and sped, red light through red light rushing to the pharmacy. \n \n He helped Sarah out of the car, and hurried her through the door. \n \n \u201c Somebody help us! I need an epi-pen! \u201d \n \n The pharmacist looked at him, and then at Sarah. His eyes widened, \u201c Yeah of course! \u201d \n \n The manager seemed to hear this and hurried over to the pharmacist. Terry could barely hear him ask if he checked them for a prescription. After a little arguing the manager coolly looked over and said, \u201c I \u2019 m sorry sir, but we require a prescription for epi-pens. Do you have one on you? \u201d \n \n \u201c Look at my wife you idiot, just give us the damn epi-pen! \u201d The manager was obviously shocked, but he was compliant. He walked between the shelves, and came back empty handed. \n \n \u201c I -- I \u2019 m sorry it appears we \u2019 re out of them at the moment. We can \u2019 t help any customer \u2019 s without a prescription anyway. \u201d \n \n I don \u2019 t know if she gave up after hearing that the pharmacy was out of epi-pens, or if she just didn \u2019 t have enough air, but with the bad news Sarah fell to the ground. The sound of her head cracking against the ground obviously affected the pharmacist. He ran to the back and came back with an epi-pen in hand. The manager grabbed his arm, \n \n \u201c They don \u2019 t have a prescription, do you want to lose your license? \u201d \n \n The pharmacist shook free and ran to Sarah, he jabbed her in the thigh with the pen. Terry and the pharmacist waited patiently for a sign, for her to breathe deeply and come out of it. Seconds felt like minutes, and seconds revealed the blood pooling under her auburn hair. \n \n \u201c S\u2014Sarah? Damn it, call an ambulance, something! \u201d \n \n He reached for her neck, and felt her pulse. \u201c Sarah don \u2019 t do this to me, don \u2019 t do this. Sarah wake up honey, wake up baby. \u201d \n \n The moment her blue eyes went gray carved itself into his memory like a bright light against morning eyes, and he knew; Sarah was gone. \n\n"}

It was a pleasant night, with the sounds of the river behind her muffled by the buildings. Each of them was mostly empty, of course, except for the buzzing flies and rats and roaches that had been happily feeding the last two months. Every so often a cat or dog would pop out and jog across the street, heading off to who-knows-where to try to make a go of it. \n \n Most would n't make it, of course. Only the survivors. The ones with enough wits, luck, or some combination of the two to find food and water and stay out of the heat. \n \n *Like me, I guess*, Magda sighed to herself. \n \n Cat and dog corpses littered the sidewalks, too, around the piles of putrid flesh and bones that had once been the hipsters and college students of this trendy neighborhood in Austin. Magda was glad that the heat had baked them so thoroughly - in the first two weeks the smell had been unbearable, but they were starting to dessicate now, or maybe her nose was just getting used to it. \n \n \\*Ding! \\* went her phone, and she looked down. Another damn pidgey. How was it possible that in the aftermath of 7 billion deaths there was still nothing better out there than pidgeys and rattatas? You'd think someone's dying action would have been to fix the balance. \n \n Nonetheless, she threw a desultory pokeball at what had to be her two or three thousandth stupid bird. A few happy sounds and animations later, she went straight to the `` transfer'' button and kicked him out. Out of her game, and out of the shambles that was her life. \n \n There was nobody left anymore. By now Magda was sure of that - she'd tried calling her friends, what family she had left, and none had answered. None had called back. There were no news anchors, no breathless hyperbolic blog posts, nothing on twitter. There was just silence. Every now and again she'd have an image of a ghost, passing in front of her vision, or a voice, hollow and distant. They were always sad, and now Magda let them be. And so, from her periphery they would come, and be ignored, and return to whatever nothingness they came from. \n \n \\*Ding! \\* again. A horsea? Well, that was better than noth... \n \n Wait. \n \n Magda had to shake her head, because the cobwebs had obviously not taken over like she thought. Up ahead, a little blue box was spinning peacefully on a thin little stick - and surrounded by flower petals and hearts. \n \n `` A *lure? *'' Magda shouted. Here? Who set it up? Was there someone else out there, lonely and bored and somehow still playing this damnable game? \n \n She set off at a jog, which turned into a trot, and then into a full-out run. She pelted down the street, leaping over the bodies of people she never knew and never would, and skidded to a halt in front of a coffee shop. The doors were open, because some poor sod had fallen over dead in the jamb. Magda wrenched the door open and the smell of curdled milk and rotting meat accosted her. No matter! There was someone here! \n \n `` Hello! I'm here! I'm here!'' she called out. Another \\*Ding! \\* and a scyther appeared on her screen. She took note of it just long enough to realize she should ignore it. Someone was here! But where? \n \n `` Hello!'' she called again. She waited. No shouts, no whoops, no... nothing. \n \n She bolted back out the door. `` Hey! Where are you?'' she hollered. `` Somebody! Are you there?'' \n \n Only an echo of her voice. She tried once more: `` You're here! I know you're here! I know! I know! God dammit where are you?'' She screamed wordlessly, her voice - so unused in the last few months - tearing at her throat, all of the loneliness and anger and despair welling out of her, released in one keening wail as she collapsed onto her knees on the sidewalk. \n \n Some time later - she did n't know how long - she realized the rough surface of the sidewalk was digging into her knees. She must have torn her jeans as she fell. Tears had streamed down her face and onto her chest, staining her shirt. She did n't remember crying, but there they were. She scootched onto her backside and looked again at the screen. It must have been a mistake. A server error off in Japan or Korea or wherever. \n \n The petals still rained down. Magda watched for a minute. The petals stopped. \n \n And then they started up again. \n \n \\*Ding! \\* Pinsir. \\*Ding! \\* Geodude. \\*Ding! \\* \\*Ding! \\* \\*Ding! \\* \n \n Finally, Magda realized. The lure was a subscription. It was there to bring business to this stupid coffee shop with the rotten beans and the moldy muffins. The dead bastards in there had probably been drawn by the lure the same way she had, but that was back when there were still living and breathing people to talk to. \n \n A voice ghosted in her ear, just on the edge of hearing. `` Magda,'' it said. `` Magda. I hope you like my storiesssssss.....'' \n \n Magda brushed it away. There was a tightness in her chest. *Must be from all the crying* she thought. But it was getting hard to breathe. She tried again, and it hitched. She... she could n't... why was it dark? *It's too early for this! * She was starting to get scared. Again, she tried to take a breath, to calm, but it got stuck. Her chest would n't expand. The air would n't come! What was wrong? Was this it? Was this what happened to everyone else? \n \n Fear gripped Magda. `` I want to live!'' she gasped out. She tried, to no avail, to pull in air. The sweet, rancid, death-stained air that would keep her alive. But it would n't come. She sucked and it was worthless, an impotent gasp that did nothing. `` I... I just... a dragonite... a... blurbbbl... a...'' \n \n Magda fell over and was still. A hound, tongue lolling out, came over and sniffed. \n \n \\*Ding! \\* \n \n Years later, when he was being put to death for his crimes, Brian Sewaten was asked if he would like to give a final statement, an account of his actions before he went to meet whatever god would accept his soul. He sniffed for a moment, and then he finally said, `` They were all in comas. Nobody would miss them. I tell them a little story and then I pull the plug. And they die. Happy, maybe, but I do n't know. It's not like they were going to wake up anyway.''\n"}

Intelligence points started maxing out. \n \n `` When intelligence is maxed, just start getting crazy with slavery. Make it widespread and normal. That way they can use their slaves effectively.'' \n \n Humans started organizing slaves to create giant structures. \n \n `` This bit is quite tough to work out,'' continued Zaza. `` But basically, with the right balance of astronomers, philosophers and mathematicians, they will build this.'' \n \n He pointed in admiration at the great pyramid. \n \n `` This will map out the stars and predict any apocalyptic disaster.'' \n \n `` Oohhh that's how it's done,'' said Claxen, looking impressed. \n \n `` Yea, but this just gets them past the first hurdle, their intel goes back down and they forget how to use the pyramid for a while.'' \n \n The Humans on the screen start using the pyramid and forecast a giant, apocalyptic flood. They use this knowledge to build a huge boat to avoid extinction. \n \n `` That took me ages to figure out. It takes them nearly fifteen thousand years to rediscover all their technology, and when they do, they pretty much destroy their planet. There's no way around that.'' \n \n `` You find a new planet?'' Asked Claxen. \n \n `` Na,'' replied Zaza. `` That's what I thought, but there's actually no time.

No sounds moved past my lips, though. I sat, struggling against the constraints that had begun to chafe my wrists, ankles, and stomach. I did n't know how much time had passed. It could have been one minute or thirty. A door that I had n't noticed earlier slid open, making no sound, and a tall, slender woman strode in, clad in a long black dress wearing stiletto heels. \n \n `` What do you remember?'' the woman asked, blunt but curiously. \n \n `` What do you mean,'' I demanded. \n \n `` Just tell me what you saw if you ever want to be set free,'' she threatened with a scowl that could have scared Danny Trejo. \n \n My hatred of being restricted forced me to reluctantly begin, `` I remember seeing other people.'' I said, `` They were n't talking though, and I did n't know any of them. They just kind of stood there... existing. I could n't talk either, and now that I think about it, there were no sounds. I was walking down the crowded streets of Washington DC, when I saw someone fall. The person had been shot. Again, I heard no sound to tell me this. But then I looked down at my own hands, and there I saw the culprit of the soundless gunshot. \n \n `` I had no control over my body anymore, and it began shooting all the people standing, looking in awe at the White House, wondering what it would be like to live in such a beautiful mansion but forgetting the stress and agonizing responsibilities that accompany it. People were dropping left and right on my account. In my mind, my incredible empathetic feelings were driving me insane. My mind could n't handle shooting any more innocent people, but I had no control. \n \n `` My body started walking towards the White House, seemingly invincible, not feeling any bullets that had begun to fly at unimaginable speeds towards the body I used to call my own. It was already approaching the Oval Office, where the President spends much of his time. Somehow it knew where to go. He had his back turned, and my hand raised. \n \n `` But my finger did n't move.

She finally came to her conclusion and said, \n \n `` By regaining control of your body, you have passed the test and unlocked the part of the brain that no one has been able to use for an eternity.

I did n't like animals in the first place, and I had been around them all my life. They're dirty, stupid and do n't ever listen to me. Dogs, cats, gerbils, hamsters and fish. I had pretty much run the gambit on things I do n't want living in my house. It only took a week or two of her whining about never having the experience that I caved, though. When it comes down to it, a few years of having an animal could n't be that bad. And it would n't be my responsibility at all... I was n't feeding it, picking up after it or cleaning its shit up. When she finally brought the damn thing home, though, I realized I had made a horrible mistake. \n \n I could tell as soon as it walked through the door that it did n't like me. All I got was a little dismissive grunt as it crept between my legs, rushing forward to make a big mess out of our pristine house. I even made an effort to be involved in its training so it would listen to me a little. No luck there, though. It only took about six weeks for the monster to learn how to open up the fridge and eat my grapes. All this terrible health food sitting on the shelf and it has to go for my food every damn time. I actually had to give up on them because the nightmare was diligent enough to tear up the fridge to get at them. \n \n Needless to say, I was n't a big fan of her pet. She even named the stupid thing Cornelius and would get upset when I called him Corny. Little Cornelius pretty much owned the house now, and as he started to get older I realized little things in the house beginning to change. Cornelius developed a bit of a mean streak when she finally tried to stop him from raiding our fridge, grunting all over and acting like he was going to charge her. I prayed for the day he'd actually try something so I could get him the hell out of this house. But he never did... Corny was the smartest little son of a bitch I've ever met. \n \n It was n't until about three months ago that I realized he was acting strangely. He'd ram the table a little bit when I had a drink on there, knocking it all over and making a big mess for me to clean up. Once I left the room and he had the nerve to do it again... I came back just in time to slip and fall on my ass. I was so angry I could have killed the little prick, but he was an angel to my girlfriend. I just had to sit there and watch while he walked away all proud of himself, grunting his animal insults back to me. Since then he's been knocking over the bathroom trash can too, using his fat nose to make a huge mess out of everything. It only seems to happen right after I've shaved, too, so there is always a razor blade or two waiting for me. Besides that, he times it just right so whenever I get all dressed up for work he charges in to brush by me and get my pants all dirty. \n \n I know it sounds ridiculous, but I honestly think Corny is a lot more intelligent than he's letting on. It's like the prick is planning all these things... he knows my girlfriend wo n't believe me if I tell her that I'm being sabotaged by her cute little friend. Every time I catch him in the act she's nowhere to be found, so I can never get the evidence I need to get him the hell out of here. Sometimes it seems like she'd choose him over me, to be honest, but there's no way that's going to happen. \n \n Anyway, I need to go now. I think I hear him rooting around in the garbage again, and if he makes one more mess we're going to have some fresh bacon tonight. \n \n \n\n"}

The rest of the gang glared at me. \n \n `` Maybe I did, maybe I did n't. Maybe someone here should n't have attempted to r @ pe me.'' I shot a look at Puffer and blew him a kiss. \n \n `` Why I oughta-'' Just as he lunged to me, the Hunter burst through the wall, slamming Puffer to the ground. \n \n `` Reef Gang! Stand down!''

Like one that had been sealed up in a box, hidden away into the corner of an attic and undiscovered until old Aunt Sally finally kicks the bucket and her money grubbing children scour the house for valuables. \n \n One of her kids begins to slowly open a corner of the box to peer in when a remnant of Aunt Sally's famous meatloaf slaps them in the face. They seal the box back up and haul it off to the local donation dumpster. Soon, it will find a home amongst old out of style clothes, board games based on long-cancelled TV shows, and random computer wires for peripherals that no one even remembers. \n \n And me. Despite the odor, I ca n't stay away from thrift shops. I'm not a hoarder, which is what a hoarder would say, but truly I'm not. I first began to hit the local Salvation Army when I got a job at a certain retailer that requires brown pants and navy blue shirts ( hint: it rhymes with Wal-Mart ). This was a time in my life when I lived solely on rice, ramen, watered-down milk, and the most basic of cable packages. Funds devoted to brand-new clothing was out of the question, especially before my first pay check ( which if I recall ended up being a pretty sweet $ 318 before taxes, for two whole weeks of work ). \n \n So the day before my first official day of employment, I headed off to the local Salvation Army. I wear size 32x30 pants, so naturally I grabbed a pair of 40x26. Typically I wear a medium sized polo; I snagged an XXL. I headed off to the fitting room. The only one available had a broken mirror, no hooks, and a sign reading `` Please throw all unwanted items on the floor. Thx -- Management.'' \n \n I put on the polo first, it felt like I was swimming in daddy's shirt. It'll shrink. I then pull up the pants to my waist, I glance down and see my wiggling toes and a good six inches of my shin. I laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of not just these stupid pants, but my life. \n \n `` How is this funny, Harold?'' \n \n I look up. An overweight man in a light blue button-down whose threads are being put to the test by the beer belly enclosed in it. \n \n I feel lightheaded. Like when you drive home from work and after you park in the driveway and think `` Holy shit, how did I get here? Did I sleep drive?'' \n \n The menacing figure shakes his sweaty fleshy face and asks again `` Huh? What's so funny?'' \n \n I start to stutter and barely get out `` Heh... oh... these p-pants. So big.'' \n \n `` Jesus Christ, Harold. Get your shit together, finish this cart or I swear to god this is it, this is your last chance!'' He swivels around, pretty light for such a large pear-shaped man, and waddles off with quick little steps past the rows of milk. \n \n Rows of milk? Why is their milk in Salvation Army? I fully look around, taking in all 360 degrees. I'm surrounded by milk and cheese and yogurt and more milk. It's cold. I look down. My polo is tighter, and the ends of my pant legs lead to black square shoes that look like something my Uncle Fred would wear when his bunion was acting up. \n \n I see a glimmer to my left and turn towards it; a large metal door showing my reflection. I look like I'm 5 feet tall and if someone were to describe me as a furry bowling ball, I probably would n't argue too much. I take a couple of steps closer to the door. I see an old man, maybe mid-late 60s, head shaped like a charcoal artist's rendition of a lumpy cantaloupe, a plumpy little torso with short stubby arms and legs. \n \n I take on step closer to the door, noticing a name tag hanging from my left breast. I try to read it. Oh, it's backwards. Duh. I look down and flip it around. HAROLD - SALES ASSOCIATE. WAL-MART. \n \n I look back up at the door and stammer, `` Oh boy...'' \n \n `` Oh boy is right! Get that cart out there and work like your life depends on it. Cause it does!'' The slender figure of an older woman guides me towards a stocking cart containing a mess of cardboard boxes. She opens the glimmering metal door and shoos me out. I head down a long dark corridor, passing by pallets with towering, precariously leaning box upon box. I see a light up ahead, coming from two giant double doors. \n \n When I get out I'm blinded by artificial light, screaming children, and that familiar sense of dread. I struggle to maintain the cart, barely getting it to go straight. It makes a loud squeaking noise which is abruptly interrupted when I ram into something. I peer around the side of the cart because I ca n't see over it. It's the giant pear man. This time I take in his name badge. RONALD - ASST. MGR. WAL-MART. \n \n `` Pull the cart! Do n't push! Never push! You know this! Strike two!'' The pear barely manages to keep from foaming. \n \n `` Sorry... Ronald.'' I slowly reply, making eye contact with my head tipped down in shame. He just glares at me. \n \n I notice one of the boxes says `` KRFT AMRCN CHEESE SNGL,'' so I head toward the cheese section I see clearly ahead of me. Pulling the cart. Wow, this is easier. Pear had a good point. I stop by the Kraft cheese slices. There's about 5 different varieties in an unfathomable selection of sizes. I go to lift the box from the cart and almost drop it. Man, I'm weak. Or, maybe Harold is weak? I remind myself of the strange dream-like world I'm actually inhabiting, but I push on. \n \n I ca n't figure out how to open the box. I claw at what appears to be an opening, but my fingernails just dig into the cardboard. I feel someone watching me. I glance over and it's Ronald the pear, with the same exact glare. \n \n I turn my back toward him so he does n't see me struggle with the box. `` C'mon box, fucking open. Open sesame.'' I try to claw at the box again. A small hole appears! I dig my finger into the tiny opening and try to rip across, placing my weight on one side of the box. I push harder. The box tears open and out flies 20 packages of Kraft American Cheese, spilling a good 5 feet in every direction. \n \n `` That's it!'' The pear is rushing toward me. \n \n I panic. What the hell am I even doing here? I bolt off toward the produce section. My body is not moving fast. My body? Not my body. Harold's body! That's how I got here! I tried on those old fart clothes! \n \n Can I be thinking clearly? Am I really going to have to disrobe to be me again? As I run by the deli case, I catch another glimpse of `` me.'' It's that short little weird body again. I look like a walking bomb-omb but without the grace. \n \n It's now or never. I throw off the polo. \n \n `` Harold! Your shirt! Holy shit what are you doing?!'' The pear shouts behind me. \n \n No turning back now. I veer off and head for the checkout. I try to take my pants off while running and begin to lose my balance hopping along on one foot. I get one pant leg off when I completely lose balance. Just as I begin to pull the other leg off I fall to my back. I feel like an upside down turtle. Looking up while pulling the khaki pant leg left over my heel, the pear appears above me. `` YOU'RE FIR...'' \n \n I'm in the fitting room again. I'm covered in sweat, but in the reflection of the busted mirror I can see that I'm me again. I quickly put my clothes back on and throw the over-sized polo and khakis into the corner of the fitting room. \n \n I do n't tell anyone what happened. I just decide to push forward. Work this job, get a steady paycheck, go back to school, get my life in order. \n \n For my first day at Wal-Mart, I break dress code and show up in a black polo and black pants. I look like an ugly male version of Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face. \n \n `` You know you're supposed to wear navy blue and brown, right?'' The trainer at orientation asks\/informs me. \n \n They guide me to the backroom, through a long walkway, overfilled with stock. We reach a large sliding door, which when the trainer opens, reveals a cold, gray, cubed room, filled with dairy products. \n \n The trainer points ahead. `` This is Sue, she'll show you around.'' From behind a wall of milk crates appears the slender figure of an older woman. \n \n She offers her hand to shake and gently asks `` Oh, you must be Harold's replacement?''\n"}

When you live next to a busy highway and train tracks, you learn to fall asleep with the white noise and come to enjoy it. At least I did. \n \n That all changed when Julia was born. Oh, sweet soft baby Julia was such a precious treasure to my wife Audrey and me. Julia was six months old and it's amazing how babies work. They'll be sleeping during the day, and wide awake at night, sucking on their pacifier as the little galaxy floats above them. \n \n When Julia was born, Audrey insisted on turning the guest bedroom into a nursery. `` But where will the guests stay?''

You wake up with a name on your arm and no knowledge of how it got there .\n","story":"I've never met a killer. At least, I do n't think so. I dated this chick Maggie for a while who had the name'Kyle' scrawled on her arm. When I saw it, she said that it was a drunken decision to get a tattoo of her ex's name. I think I believed her... or maybe I did n't. Needless to say, that relationship did n't work out. \n I've always been a pretty nervous guy. Nervous I'll get fired for a tiny mistake, worried my taxi driver will spontaneously decide to run me off the road, nervous that my first drink will somehow magically get me wasted and I'll embarrass myself. That last one is kinda important. \n So I was at work yesterday and one of my coworkers Neil walks up and peers over my cubicle. I jumped ( of course ). \n `` Hey, what's up Mark?'' he says, `` Me and Greg were gon na go out and watch the Hawks game over at Joe's bar. Feel like swinging by?'' \n Now, Neil is one of those guys that has always made me nervous. He looked like... I dunno, like he had way too many friends in high school. You know what I mean? Anyway, my brain immediately goes to what this guy could want. Was he going to play some prank on me? Sit me next to some hottie to watch me sweat? What? \n For some reason, I said yes. I have no idea why. The word just kind of came out of its own accord, and before I knew it, I was out at the bar. \n And I got drunk. SO drunk. I think that was the plan. `` Hey here's this super nerdy guy, let's get him wasted and see what happens.'' \n I wish I could tell you what happened that night, but to be honest... I do n't remember anything. One second I'm sitting at the bar knocking back a shot and the next I'm waking up in bed. \n And DAMN that was hard. I've never had a hangover like that. Opening my eyes hurt. Breathing hurt. The simple idea of moving from this spot hurt. \n It took about ten minutes, but I managed to reach my phone ( in my pocket... I was still wearing all my clothes ) and I start emailing my boss with my eyes mostly closed. \n ``... sorry... I'm... not... feeling... well... and... what the fuck?'' \n My fingers felt sludgy, like I had dipped them in glue. I look at my phone to see dark red-brown stains on the keyboard. And suddenly I got that feeling. Worse than the hangover. That feeling in your stomach when you know something terrible but you do n't want to accept it. \n It was the hardest thing I've ever done, slowly sliding my eyes over to the right, to my hand holding up my phone, down my arm, to just below my elbow. And there it was. The name. \n `` Neil'' \n Shit. \n How did this happen. \n How did this happen. What am I gon na do. How did this happen. Shit. \n SHIT. \n It did n't happen. It could n't have happened. How? This big jock-looking guy versus me? How? \n And just like that, no more hangover. I got out of bed and I ran to the stairs. I needed air. I needed to think. \n Shit. \n I ca n't go downstairs. People will see me. They'll know. Shit. \n Shit. \n The roof. I used to smoke up there, back when I smoked. Smokes! That'll calm me down. I ran back in my apartment and grabbed a stale pack out of the drawer in the kitchen, then up to the roof. \n I sat on the side of the building smoked the whole thing. It was disgusting.

I closed my eyes and breathed deeply for the first time since yesterday. \n And I fell. \n I always thought you would n't feel the impact from falling off of a six story building. But I did. It took a few minutes for me to die.

Said with the grace of a queen and the spite of a man about to start a fight. \n \n I sat down at her cafe table. The place around us was empty save for an old man and his old dog sharing a quiet conversation through certain looks. Tessa told me about her job, her day, her past and her possible futures. She spoke to me as if I were a priest she was confessing not only her sins to but her loves and losses and victories as well. She spoke to me as if she was never going to see me again. So what could she have to lose? \n \n The longer she spoke the more in love with her I fell. Some people fall with the weight of a feather. I fell like a world collapsing into the bottom of space. If such a thing were possible. I fell hard for this stranger called Tessa. While she remained firmly in her place. She was the love of my life. I was one of her many strangers. \n I ended up telling her about my ex. She was silent for a while before something kicked in. An irritated look passed briefly over her face. Her eyebrows furrowed, her mouth formed a tense line. I would later realise, after months of seeking her out and revisiting the cafe we met at, after months of searching for her online, that she was judging how easily I fell in love. She had silently predicted my falling in love with her. The moment she told me about her ex, I thought she was just giving me what I had given her: a sad story for a sad story. Little did I know Tessa was teaching me a lesson. \n \n I knew she was smart. Looking back on it, she was probably one of those smart people who only mingled with other smart people and would remain in that sophisticated bubble of intelligence for the rest of her life. I imagine the only idiots she spoke with were the ones that threw themselves at her. She was intelligent because she looked at me for only a brief hour within an afternoon surrounded by an infinite amount of afternoons and told me the truth. Intelligent people never lie. It doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re heartless or cruel in what they offer to tell you, but they don \u2019 t follow the social cues of aimless flattery or chatter. Every word is carefully said. Every word is a lesson. And if that lesson is listened to, it has the power to change your life forever. Tessa taught me a lesson. Tessa told me about her ex. \n \n I replied to her story, \u201c You loved him deeply. You were that infatuated with him? \u201d I remember letting jealousy colour my tone. \n \n She regarded me with seriousness. Intelligent people don \u2019 t mock others when they \u2019 re about to grow. They \u2019 re endlessly patient. Tessa replied. \n \n \u201c No, I wasn \u2019 t in love. I wasn \u2019 t infatuated either. I was obsessed. And Thank god I was obsessed. The point of an obsession is that it \u2019 s short-lived. Like a fever dream. Love is everlasting. If love is loving the reality of a person then obsession is idealising the fantasy of an idea. And an idea of an individual holds absolutely nothing against the actual person. An idea is a shadow. While a person is an entire world. \u201d \n \n Tessa the idea. Tessa my afternoon obsession. Tessa the girl I saw in a cafe who I imagined our whole life together after just looking at the shape of her face and the way she sipped her drink.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Combine two seemingly unrelated fields of study . Give it a name and describe a university class on that new field .\n","story":"Welcome to *Introduction to Botanical Psychology*! Please read the syllabus in full. \n \n You will need to buy the following textbooks: *That Smell is Actually Screams: The Language of Grass* by Peter Moss, *Mozart or Bob Dylan: A Friendly User's Guide to the Musical Preferences of Herbs* by Rosemary Green, and *Vegetarianism is a Mistake* by Thomas Ato \n \n The semester will be split into 4 sections: \n \n Section 1: You will learn the common misconceptions people have about vegetative happiness. You may think your potted palm tree is perfectly content to sit on your front porch, but if it suddenly had a voice it would give you a piece of its mind and probably demand to be moved closer to the shower. Also in this section we will cover the ethics of vegetarianism and forestry. Plants are deeply oppressed but literally can not speak for themselves. We are currently developing a tree translator that should greatly reduce these barbaric practices. Could you imagine your spinach screaming every time you went in to take a bite? So could we, and we think it would give you nightmares for the rest of your life. \n \n Section 2: You will learn to interpret the feelings in your vegetable garden and exactly where each one should be planted for all of them to get along. Carrots and radishes clash tremendously and you do not want a full out, furious ( albeit silent ) war on your hands. Potatoes and parsley, on the other hand, get along splendidly and do n't be surprised if you find they've invited their parents over to meet each other one day. \n \n Section 3: You will learn to interpret your household flowers' musical preferences. You may be shocked by your adolescent perennial's sudden shift toward death metal, but do n't be alarmed- it is only going through a phase and will probably appreciate Cream or the Kinks in another year or so. Also, you may think your rose is only interested in Vivaldi, but you would be surprised. Many roses have been known to appreciate Stravinski, Philip Glass, or even Metallica. \n \n Section 4: Finally, you will learn the history of invasive species. It is commonly perceived that these plants are pests, but if you imagine that out of control blackberry bush as the mighty Genghis Kahn marching over Russia, you might think twice about hacking it to bits to save your begonias. Sometimes history plays out in mysteries ways. Nevertheless, we understand the need to protect certain species from extinction, at least until the botanical linguists can do a proper observational study. \n \n Course times are MWF 10-11AM in room 304 of the Psychology Building.\n"}

I helped him out of the car. It was slow. It was tough. It was painful, but we made it to the steps of the hospital. I took a deep breath and grasped his hand. \n \n `` This is it. Are you ready?'' I asked him a look of hopelessness glazed over his eyes. He did n't reply, but I was used to it now. I forced a smile and said, `` Come on, let's go.'' It was hard not to cry, but I had to keep it inside. If I did n't look strong, he would lose all hope. \n \n We stepped inside the hospital and saw a bored receptionist with way too much make-up on her face. I talked with her and she led us to a doctor who told me to stay outside for a few minutes. I sat on the bench, but could n't bring myself to read the magazines on the shelves or look at my phone. All I could do was think about what the doctor was telling Emory. After what seemed like an eternity, he came out and I immediately dropped to my knees and hugged him. \n \n The doctor waited a few seconds and said, `` There's no doubt about it. His body wo n't hold up much longer. He has *hours* at most now, Zoey.'' \n \n The truth. The cold truth. I hugged him tighter and felt a tear-drop trickle down my left cheek. I got up and thanked the doctor and told him we were going home. As I went out of the hospital, my phone started ringing. \n \n `` Hello? Who is this?'' I asked. \n \n `` How are you picking up? That should n't be possible.'' the voice said. The person hung up and I looked at my phone, puzzled. I did n't think much of it. \n \n As I drove home, I got another call from an unknown number. As tempted as I was to ignore it, I picked up out of curiosity. This time, a higher-pitched female voice screamed and yelled. `` Are you okay? What's going on there?'' I asked, shocked. I stopped the car and Emory looked at me. He was scared. I glanced at him with a look that said everything was going to be okay, but he was too scared to think that. \n \n `` This is strange... this is strange...'' the voice said. \n \n `` What is?'' I asked, confused. \n \n `` You have the money... I know where you live, do n't move now.'' the voice said, this time whispering. \n \n My eyes widened and I hung up immediately. The money. I had won 900 million dollars in a lottery two days ago. \n \n -- \n \n To my surprise, the doctor's prediction was luckily off. Emory fought and survived for two more months, but the disease did n't kill him. It was a school trip. He and his friends died in an accident that could n't be described by anything other than a tragedy. The young lives that could have been so much in the world, beautiful healthy children, died. The day of the tragedy, I got a letter saying **I KNOW YOU STILL HAVE THE MONEY**. It was true. I never knew what to do with that much money. My brother and I lived simply, we were never rich. A series of news articles and broadcasts over a period of three weeks drove me through a wave of fear, anxiety, hopelessness, and emptiness. I spent the time going to all of his favourite places, eating his favourite foods, and most importantly of all, wishing he was still here. I would have nightmares where I'd be in the ship with him and he would be reaching his hand to grab mine, but a wave would sweep him away before I could grab him. It felt like hell to lose him. \n \n Over a period of four months, I gave away most of the money to various charities and organisations. It was one thing to lose my brother. It was another thing to go downtown and drink his favourite bubble tea by myself and remember him every time I did so. I spent 900 million dollars to defeat one thing. I thought to myself silently. Emory, it's been a rough six months. I looked up the sky, so vast and beautiful like his eyes were. Everything I would do you were standing by my side. It's been a long day without you my friend, and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. I closed my eyes and they never opened again.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You die and go to hell , only to realize that Satan is actually a pretty chill dude , and is God\u00b4s roommate stoner roommate .\n","story":"I was never a religious man. In fact, as I was on my death bed, no thoughts of an afterlife ever even crossed my mind. All I could really think about was losing my wife, Karen, and my kids, Phillip and Fiona. Pancreatic cancer. I was only 37 years old, and I went in for a routine checkup with my doctors. The bastards told me I had pancreatic cancer, and would most likely not make it another year. If nothing else, at least I proved those douchebags wrong, because I was n't dead until 13 months and 22 days after they told me the news. \n \n I was n't really thinking about that either. I mean, it did cross my mind, and I did say it to my wife and kids to lighten the mood a little bit. I got a chuckle out of Karen, but the kids did n't see the dark humor. It was about two in the morning on July 22nd. I kissed them each goodnight, and not too long after I fell asleep. I woke up about 2 hours later, but I was n't in the hospital anymore. \n \n What surrounded me was nothing like anybody had ever said it was. In fact, Hell looked more like a college campus than a miserable inferno. As I walked around, confused as ever, I was approached by a red man, who had horns and looked just like Satan stereotypically does. \n \n `` You're new here, right? Come with me.'' As he said this, he started walking away, towards a huge building. I stood there, completely dumbfounded. He turned around, looked at me, and said `` Are you fucking deaf? Come on man!'' He took out a pen and put it to his mouth. I knew what this was, my younger brother was doing it when I saw him at Thanksgiving last year. Vaping it was called, and Satan hit what I could only imagine my brother would describe as, `` The fattest fucking cloud ever.'' \n \n I walked with him hesitantly, until we entered the big building, and went into the first door on the right. The room was messy as ever, and ironically enough, it looked just like my college dorm had 15 years prior. He climbed up a ladder in the middle of the room, right next to a bong that appeared to be about eight or nine feet tall. `` Hey, you mind lighting that bowl for me? I'll clap when I want you to pull the bowl out.'' \n \n It had been about 10 years since I had smoked weed, but I still remembered how a bong worked. `` Ummm, OK I guess'' were something like the words that I uttered. Needless to say, I had seen some people take huge hits in college, but none of them even got close to Satan. He threw me two blow torches, and when I looked down at the base of the bong, I realized there were two bowls on it. The man took both bowls in one hit. He shot the smoke out of his mouth, nose, and even his horns. He had hotboxed an entire dorm room in one hit. I was astounded. \n \n `` Hey man, you want a hit?'' He asked me. \n \n At this point, I was basically speechless, and had forgotten all about dying, so I just said to him, `` No thanks, my company drug tests once a month. I ca n't.'' \n \n `` Another one, really? OK buddy, I'm gon na tell you once, it's gon na be harsh and you're not gon na like hearing it, but you need to know this, OK? YOU. ARE. FUCKING. DEAD. So, now that you know you wo n't be drug tested anymore, I again propose the question. You want a hit?'' \n \n `` Oh yeah, I guess I forgot. Umm, it's been quite a while since I had any, but I guess I have nothing to lose.'' \n \n `` That's what I like to hear!'' He knealt down next to the bong, and packed the bowls. He lit the bowls, and by the time that the smoke hit me, I was already coughing. \n \n `` You like that? Its Magic fucking weed man, partially because the bowl never runs out, and partially because it's the best fucking weed in the entire goddamn universe. Oh shit, I forgot to introduce myself, my name is Satan, if you could n't already tell by the horns, and with me being red and shit.'' \n \n `` OK, I'll admit, this is some damn good weed, and you're Satan, but where in the fuck am I?'' I said him. \n \n `` Oh, this is the University of the Gods, and I live here with my roommate, God.'' \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] People have a single verb as a power , and fight by using it creatively\n","story":"The long oak doors of the Great Hall groaned and creaked as the din of the siege echoed within the palace walls. Four warriors stood behind the doors, the last line of defense for the chancellor as he tended to the King. \n \n `` The doors will not hold, Magister!'' cried Knight Wester, his eyes darting nervously. `` We must flee -- we have no time left!'' \n \n Magister Lorenz ignored the soldier's pleas, his eyes closed. He pressed his hand once more against the king's sickly forehead. \n \n `` I will find him. I can feel his mind... it is still here... somewhere...'' the magister muttered softly. \n \n `` Magister, this is too much! I beg you to see reason!'' Wester implored. \n \n `` Silence!'' barked Paladin Koros, his voice filling with rage. `` You beg for treason! Do you forget your Oath so quickly, coward?'' \n \n `` The Revenant storms the gate, Koros! The King's mind is gone -- our Oath to him is fulfilled! Need we join our Lord even in death?'' Wester replied. \n \n `` Our Oath, Wester,'' interjected Chancellor Relik. `` is beyond mere death.'' He turned to face the knight, his face pale and hands shaking. `` Or do you believe us safe from the Revenant? Shall we seek refuge in the underworld from whence he came?'' \n \n `` None are safe.'' whispered Maiden Faris, her face stricken. `` The Revenant's magic has already penetrated this hall.'' She raised her head and showed the others her quivering hands. `` I can not even think of casting my Word without shaking. Even the Chancellor trembl --'' \n \n The door groaned dangerously again, interrupting Faris. The door's magic seals bent dramatically, as if pressed upon by a thousand men. Then, with a crack, the wooden doors finally broke open. Howling black air rushed into the Great Hall, but no army marched forward. \n \n Koros stood tall as his mouth began chanting his Word. Wester raised his shield in terror. Faris simply stood in place. Relik alone chose to speak to the group. \n \n `` We must stand.'' Relik said to the three, his voice wavering. `` We must use our Words. We must end this here, now.'' \n \n `` MUST WE?'' asked the Revenant, appearing suddenly behind the warriors. Its face was a gaunt mask, rotting skin stretched tautly over a long skull, and its eye sockets were empty. Its ethereal body floated above the ground, an emaciated figure wrapped in the tattered dark robes of the long-forgotten Black Order. \n \n Faris was first to turn and meet the Revenant's gaze. In an instant her mind fled in terror, and she sank to the ground screaming. Wester, upon seeing Faris so easily felled, dropped his shield and began to flee from the room. With a swift, single motion, Koros denied Wester's head the dishonor of such an exit. In the next motion, Koros returned his attention to the Revenant and charged with all of his might. \n \n `` AMUSING,'' the Revenant slithered as it effortlessly rose several feet out of Koros' reach. `` AN AVATAR OF RAGE.'' \n \n It turned to Relik, who had closed his eyes and begun clenching his hands. \n \n `` AND YOU?'' \n \n Kill. The Word which had made Relik the second most powerful man in the kingdom. Relik pointed his mind towards the Revenant and whispered his Word. \n \n Kill. \n \n Kill. \n \n Kill. \n \n But the Revenant only laughed as seconds passed. Relik opened his eyes and met the gaze of the Revenant. He gulped. \n \n `` You can not die.'' he whispered. \n \n `` I AM BORN FROM DEATH.'' the Revenant replied. `` I AM TERROR.'' \n \n -- - \n \n Let me know if you'd like the ending. \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] At the edge of the city , you could look out into the dark .\n","story":"At the edge of the city, you could look out into the dark. There was nothing interesting to see out there. Weeds and broken bottles lined a rocky seashore, and the waves rolled in with a soothing regularity. Despite the mundane nature of the mirky inlet, there was something strange about the place that always drew Conner back. He would come after his shift at the factory and stare at the smoldering horizon, acrid water lapping at his feet, a thick smoke torpid on the breeze. It was a lonely, deprecating exercise that stretched well into the night, one that allowed the youthful man to harness his imagination and invent a terrible fantasy. He was an escapist, and it did him objectively more harm than good. For every distant land he soared away to on those banks, he had a more foul realm always reeling him back in. Its voice was shrill and its leash cut into his neck. \n \n Conner would peer out into the dark and see an ornate concerto hall, hear the symphonic orchestra prepping their finest number. He would poise at the edge of his seat, eager to embrace sweet refined melodies of composure and sophistication- and then it was gone. \n \n Yes, the dark bank allowed him to escape for the most fleeting of moments, there on the unloved beach, but without fail it smashed him against the hard rocks again and again. It would wake him up mercilessly, beating the youth until he bled out onto the gravel and stone. He would gasp for his breath while the beacons that he \u2019 d been sure were luxurious yachts withdrew to the low burning oil rigs from whence they \u2019 d come. \n \n There was nothing commendable about Conner \u2019 s situation. \n \n \u201c How was the factory, love? \u201d \n \n He would stare with dead eyes at the grime clinging to the rim of the drain, ignoring the question as it was repeated a second time. \n \n \u201c Love? Are you alright? \u201d Blue eyes of the clearest strain stared up into Conner \u2019 s face. They searched the rough topology of his features much the same way he did the dark. \n \n His answer was always the same. \u201c Yeah, Sarah, I \u2019 m fine, honest. \u201d \n \n His wife \u2019 s thin frame seemed particularly lurid in the stark light of the kitchen. Conner stared at her as she shifted a load of dishes out of the way, pulling several garments and a washboard over to the steel basin. He knew he took her for granted. He didn \u2019 t care. \n \n Out on the bank, the man wiped blood from his nose and spit heavily into the dark tide as it slowly crept forward. He took a long swig from his flask, shuddering, never taking his eyes off the formless line that stretched endlessly left and right. His feet hurt from the cobbled streets in the city. They were rough and unpaved, left to repair another day. He had walked all the way to the Kanji district today, forfeiting precious hours of pay in order to visit the depot there. He felt a bitterness welling up inside. \n \n \u201c Conner Folger. Say, is that you? \u201d \n \n He looked up at the burly assistant manager who had traipsed down the assembly line. It had to be quite the occasion for one of them to come all the way down to the floor. \n \n \u201c I said, is your name Folger? \u201d \n \n \u201c Aye. \u201d \n \n \u201c Boss needs to see you up in the crow \u2019 s nest. \u201d \n \n Conner set down his tools, another worker taking his place on the line. He crossed the floor, mounting a set of steel steps that led to the managerial office space. He observed the factory as he climbed the stairs, his mind jumping away from the meticulous activity. Sarah had been ill lately. Not really in bad physical shape- just not herself. She was weak and hadn \u2019 t been eating. He had yelled at her last night and now he felt awful, almost positive she had taken it the wrong way. He could never say things right. \n \n Back on the shore, the anger swelled in his heart. He kicked at the waves and, finding the victim of his violence to be far too ephemeral, threw himself to the ground, beating at the rocks. He screamed until his voice was gone and a metallic taste filled his mouth. He lay still for a while, regulating his breathing and eventually pulling out the tin can he had recovered from the Kanji district. It had cost him a month \u2019 s worth of wages. Popping it open, he delicately grabbed the small capsules inside, quickly downing them with a mouthful of the polluted saltwater that gurgled on the course aggregate underneath his body. The lights of the rigs began to swim, and the heavens opened up, spilling forth a glorious array of color that splashed onto the lifeless waters below. Conner saw several fins out on the bay, massive creatures that patrolled otherwise placid shores, making sure no one could ever escape the suffocating clutches of the city. He would have tried to swim away by now had it not been for those sharks. He forgot the lights and focused on the fish, becoming irrationally cross. \n \n \u201c You PRICKS! \u201d He screamed at the aquatic beings. \u201c Why can \u2019 t you let us go!? \u201d \n \n Conner stopped and listened for their response, his delirium setting in with full force. \u201c Why the *fuck* are you ignoring me?! \u201d He screamed to the giant fins circulating the cold waters. \u201c They don \u2019 t pay you enough for this! They don \u2019 t pay you enough- \u201c \n \n The man began to cough, choking on his own words. He stumbled forward into the water. \n \u201c You pricks just wan na see us die! You just want to see us bleed until we can \u2019 t no more! \u201d He still spoke to the sharks. \u201c That \u2019 s all you bloodthirsty bastards want\u2026 \u201d \n \n Conner fumbled around in the water, his hand closing around a sharp object buried in the gravel. \u201c Thas all you want\u2026 \u201d He raised the broken shard of glass and slashed open his arm, gritting his teeth in pain. \u201c Drink up you *fucking* beasts. \u201d \n \n He continued to cut himself until his blood saturated the water, somehow making the chilly tide even darker in the night. \n \n Conner woke up in the morning. He was beached on the bank, covered in silt and dried blood. Pale light washed over his shredded arms, revealing deep scars that had been reopened time and time again. Struggling up onto his knees, the man began to sob. He had lost his job at the factory yesterday. He wasn \u2019 t sure how he would pay for rent, much less medicine for Sarah and food for both of them. He \u2019 d spent all of his savings on the small tin can that had induced his hallucinations the night before, his only escape. He sat there for a while, wallowing in his own self pity. \n \n It was a strange thing to be a passerby on that unforgiving shore, listening to strangled wails float up into the sky. Despite the veiled morning sun, you could stand on that beach and look out into a cruel, pitiful darkness.\n"}

Until I came upon the Light that is. It gave off a soft glow that radiated with warmth and was only about the size of a tennis ball. It floated before me, illuminating the smooth rock that was all around me. Inspecting the walls, i saw many carvings etched into its surface. The rock face was covered in carvings of names and initials. Of stick figure families, hand-in-hand. Some of the carvings look like tally marks, taking up whole sections of the wall. There was even a bloody hand print in one spot, the last message of someone that had lost hope in the blackness. \n \n Turning my attention back to the Light, I find it hard to look at. It feels like staring into the sun after being in the dark for so long. I reach out to the light that was just in from of me, but the further I reached, the further it seemed to pull away and yet seemed to stay in place. Despairing, I followed the Light as it moved away starting at a walk and changing to a run. Desperate I was to feel its warmth, to remain in its glow. My outstretched hand felt hot and looked like it could be closer to the orb. I ran faster. I had to catch it. I had to feel it in my hand. On my skin. It was my only hope of surviving this place. \n \n I ran. On and on, I ran. The tunnel never turned, it never shifted except for the carvings. Hundreds and thousands of carvings passed as I chased the Light, never stopping to inspect them. Until at last, the tip of my finger felt the surface of the light. The Light exploded forcing my hands to my eyes to block out the brightness. The darkness around me melted away in an instant and I felt warm. For once, I truly felt alive. \n \n I opened my eyes slowly. Light was everywhere. The tunnel I had been trapped in was no more, and instead I stood on a sea of clouds. I great gate of gold and marble stood before me. A man in an all white toga held together by a golden clasp with the image of lightning bolt engraved on it stood beside one of its pillars. In his hands, he held a clipboard and on his face, was a pleasant smile. \n \n `` Welcome,'' he said, `` to Elysium.''\n"}

That kid is such a tool. \n \n Over the years the shop has evolved from a quaint three room * ( armor, weapons, magic ) * to the largest single stop shop in the world, and the second most profitable.

Those goblins will buy *anything* if it has the stink of gold on it, which is easy to achieve for a little rat alchemist like him. That's a trade secret between you and I, traveler.

I'm stepping out of the capsule now...'' \n \n The man in white slowly descended the ladder, his body adjusting to his weight. The feeling was strangely unfamiliar, despite rehearsing it thousands of times. Part of him half expected to be swallowed whole by the ground, despite it holding firmly against the capsule. \n \n *You've got this, * he thought. *Breathe normally. Just like in training. * \n \n He was at the end of the ladder; his right foot touched the ground, the hard unyielding ground, with a decisive *thud. * He did n't hear it, nor did he need to. \n \n `` Yes,'' he said. `` The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers to the soles and side of my boots, like powdered charcoal. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.'' \n \n His companion soon descended with a small bundle. `` Neil's unveiling the plaque now, the one we brought with the rest of our gear,'' he chimed in. \n \n Neil took the plaque from his companion, hopping a short distance from the capsule, before setting it into the soil. He stepped back, taking a photograph for the folks at home: \n \n **HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON** \n \n **JULY 1969, A.D.** \n \n **WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND** \n \n *Neil A. Armstrong, Astronaut* \n \n *Michael Collins, Astronaut* \n \n *Edwin E. Aldrin, Astronaut* \n \n *Richard M. Nixon, President, United States of America* \n \n His companion's shadow fell across the plaque, followed by a third. Unlike the two humans', the third shadow was rounder, accentuated by two triangle-shaped ears on its top. \n \n Neil looked up, startled, to see a small pink creature that looked like it was blushing. `` Houston,'' he said, surprised. `` Are you getting this?'' \n \n `` Jim did n't say anything about this last year,'' the other astronaut said. `` It looks like a stuffed animal?'' \n \n The small pink creature, carefully watching the two astronauts, hopped over to the capsule. A tiny pair of wings and a curly tail helped keep it aloft as it bounced in the lunar gravity. The two followed; there was a chance that it would damage the capsule, and if they could n't lift off, they both knew they did n't even have four days' worth of supplies, no less the four months it would take Apollo XII to pick them up. \n \n `` Buzz, what do you think it's doing?'' Neil asked, watching the pink creature waddle around the capsule. It took slow, deliberate steps as it made its way around, then to the ladder. \n \n `` Sssh. Whatever it is, it looks like it's curious,'' Buzz said as he and Neil watched the creature climb into the capsule. Alarmed, the two ran for the capsule, stopping when they saw the creature step to the top of the ladder. It pushed a small curled tuft of fur (? ) into place with one tiny clawlike hand. \n \n `` Clefairy! < 3'' it said with a happy, girlish voice. It gave a small bow, then hopped over the two astronauts. Neither one was sure just how it managed to speak without air or a radio, but they *knew* it had spoken to them. \n \n `` Buzz, let's... let's just get back to *Eagle, *'' Neil sighed, watching the pink thing bounce into the distance. \n \n `` Do we tell Houston about this?'' Buzz asked. \n \n `` We're getting a quarantine as it is when we get back to Earth. Do *you* want to tell them we saw a moon fairy? We'll spend the rest of our lives in the nuthouse.'' \n \n `` Good call. We'll just tell Houston and CapCom to junk this.'' \n \n `` You do n't think she was the only one of those up here, do you?'' Neil wondered. \n \n -=-=- \n \n Cleffie hopped back to the rest of her clan, taking refuge in a small hole on the Sea of Serenity's far side. `` Clefairy fairy!'' she called out. Others like her peeked out, bounding around her.

I think so, Fablish, ]'' Cleffie said. `` [ They looked like they were busy doing grown-up things. ]'' \n \n A star-shaped creature, almost resembling Cleffie, pushed his way forward through the crowd and asked, `` [ Did they bring nice toys? ]'' \n \n `` [ They had a really nice big toy! It looked like our spaceship! ]'' Cleffie smiled, then pointed to a small blue dot in the sky. `` [ I think I saw enough of it to fix ours up, but they scared me away. ]'' \n \n `` [ So we can go dance on the Blue Planet? ]'' Fablish asked. \n \n `` [ I wan na dance on the Blue Planet and the Red Planet! ]'' the star-shaped one added. \n \n `` [ Do n't worry!

I surveyed the cafeteria looking room, looking for new movement. \n \n People were waiting everywhere, like in the Department of Motor Vehicles waiting to take their driving test. The air seemed stagnate and tense. Some people sat fidgeting. One girl, tall and thin, who looked about 9, was pacing. You could see her recounting, debating and tallying things in her head. There were a couple people sleeping. How could you sleep at a time like this? Maybe they were devout Christians, Jews, Muslims, whatevers. Maybe they did n't care. \n \n Where is this Jonathan Snatch? He knew his number was next. He was n't by the entry-way or the refreshment counter. Was he trying to hide? Did I miss the cloud of smoke? No way! Wolf's departure into a cloud of dark smoke was quick, but the pungent smell of sulfur lingered for a while. It was so quick, I ca n't even remember her first name. Gretta?... Grenadine?... \n \n Just then, I see it... a man in a seated position starts zooming across the room as if he's in an invisible batmobile. He is wide eyed and smiling ear to ear. The thin patch of hair on the top of his head is flying over his bald patch. The long portion of his comb-over now waves behind his right ear. \n \n Ahhh, that must be Jonathan Batch. I think he's driving a race or sport car. Nice. They have a funny way to escort you into heaven. Everyone goes differently. I guess it's a personalized fair tale entry. What a way to get into peace everlasting. And how amusing that Mr. Snatch just happened to be number 69. \n \n Well, I'm next. I breathe in the stale air that was just a moment ago alive and whirling from Mr. Snatch racing into heaven. I ca n't help but sit on the edge of my seat. Fuck - I mean, Fart! Sorry, Lord. Fart, I'm nervous. I'm holding my fancy 3x3 computer printed calligraphic # 70 in both hands while I look up at the ticker tape. It still says 69. \n \n... Bing... \n \n I close my eyes. I think my heart stops while I try to conjure up images of the beach, the sunset, fall foliage. \n \n... Justine Bieber... \n \n Justine Bieber? My eyes spring open to see a now crumpled # 70 in my hands. I jerk my head up to view the ticker tape, `` 71.'' \n \n I'm confused. I spend another second looking back and forth at the 71 on the ticker tape and the 70 in my hand. What the f... But before I could get the last word out, smoke silenced me and I choked on my word. I compose myself as the pungent smell of sulfur resurfaces. \n \n OK, Manny, breathe. This can be resolved. Maybe there's a technical difficulty. Maybe you were n't supposed to be here in the first place. Ha ha, my number's not up, I think victoriously, almost laughing out loud. I recompose myself again because I do n't want people thinking I'm laughing at Bieber. \n \n I go over to the refreshment counter for some water. A weird long-haired cat was taking orders from people and is now cleaning the counter and organizing the refreshments. \n \n Excuse me, I'm number 70 and they did n't call my name. Is there someone I can talk to about that? \n Sure, I'd be glad to help you with that. What's your name? \n \n I'm Manny. Manny Lovett. \n \n The cat's eyes turn cloudy like it has cataracts and its body stiffens almost as if it is stuffed. It's paws are firmly attached to the counter top and its eyelids flutter. \n \n Oh, shit, kitty. You alright? \n \n I look around to see if anybody will come to this cat's aide. And when I turn back around the cat is licking its paws and washing its face as if nothing happened. \n \n They say, `` there is no Manny Lovett in our database.'' \n \n `` Oh,... ok.'' I'm still a little weirded out by this kitty seizure I just witness. `` Sooo... I guess I'm not supposed to be here. Umm, how do I get out of here?'' \n \n `` No one here is not supposed to be here. You either get smoked into hell or a dream come true heaven entry. What's your parents' names?'' \n \n `` Alma King and Yule Lovett.'' \n \n The cat gasps. Its tail starts to flare up and its eyes become wide. `` Alma and Yule?'' \n \n By the tone of their voice, I ca n't tell if they are startled in a good or bad way. `` Yes,'' I say slowly and cautiously. \n The cat looks at me with a strange compassion, `` I believe you,'' they say as they hop off the counter to my feet. They start to walk back and forth rubbing its body on my legs alternating in figure eights. I begin to feel strangely warm and secure starting from my chest and radiating outward. Overwhelmed, I sit down on the floor with my back to the refreshment stand. And the cat crawls into my lap and curls itself into a ball. I do n't really like cats, but they have always loved me. I intuitively begin stroking this long-haired cat. I am in a trance and yet I feel like I'm breaking down and being put back together again but stronger just based on how this cat is purring and looking at me. \n \n My eyes glaze over and I begin to see in shiny hues of metallic black and white. Visions of clouds racing above a sun lit sky with naked trees swaying with the wind casting shadows on an otherwise barren ground a refreshing stream. There are no longer words, only the vibrations of the cat's purring. I now understand those vibrations. Alma and Yule stole me from my birth parents when their son, Manual, died at 2 weeks old. No cloud in the sky, it begins to rain a warm acidic rain. I see myself, my skin begin to wash away changing from from one shade of a dark shiny metal to grey to silver, each shade lighter in color until I am the light. It all becomes clear to me now. I see one of my birth parents. Oh, my Cat! He was my high school geometry teacher, Mr. Pink! I hated him; he was snappy and cranky all the time. And as soon as I was upset, the vibrations soothed me. It was time to reconnect. \n I closed my eyes, breathed in deeply and was thrust forward in a coughing fit almost off the couch. \n \n `` Prrrrrr, meow,'' said my cat at she got off my lap. She stretched her paws out in front of me and arched her back and yawned. I blinked slowly in a surreal state of loopiness as my son ran in the door in a bit of a panic. The phone rang on the side table beside me and he raced to answer it, but I got to it first. \n \n I look my son dead in the eye as I picked it up taunting him, `` Ha ha..., you did something did n't you? Hello...'' \n \n `` Yeah, um, this is Mr. Pink from the high school. I'm trying to reach the parent of Wiley Lovett.'' \n \n The cat started purring and kneading my thigh. My mouth went dry.\n"}

Sometimes, I wondered how he became one of the best thieves in his stronghold. I waited safely on the other side of the stream and watched as he struggled to find his footing against the slippery stone, and then, in a blur of obscenities and less-than-graceful motions, he fell flat on his face into the mountain-chilled water. He met me on the other side and gave me a look that said `` do n't even bother commenting''. \n \n `` Why are we hiking out here anyway, Bryn? The humans are n't real. They're a fairy tale, just like the dragons. Oh, and Little Foot.'' He complained. \n \n I led the way into the Frovian Woods and motioned for him to keep his voice down. If the faeries knew we were here, we'd never leave, but be forced to dance within their beautiful halls until our ankles snapped from exhaustion. I'd heard the stories, and that was all I needed. \n \n I lowered my own voice to below a whisper. `` Dragons *are* real, Jam, they're just... not around anymore. And besides, the humans were never a fairy tale, remember? They're a legend, and most legends are true where I come from.'' \n \n Jam laughed a deep, Orcish laugh, something that I was not used to. The treaty between the Elves and the Orcs broke down long ago, but Jamarr and I met while out hunting. He was six, and had wandered into our territory by mistake. I helped him get back to his family safely, and he gave me a few of his squirrels, which marked the beginning of our friendship. \n \n `` Right, because the Elves are just so trustworthy? Come on, Bryn, this is stupid and pointless. Let's just go home before they realize we're gone.'' He urged, stopping to look over his shoulder. I wanted to go home just as much as he did, but no one else was going to find the humans, and he promised he'd come with me. \n \n `` They *are* trustworthy, and no, it's too late to go back. Now keep your voice down or else the faeries will-'' \n \n `` Find you?'' Said a small, yet stern voice. Fear prickled the hairs on my arms as Jam and I both looked down. A blue-tailed squirrel was gazing up at us intently, his little head cocked to the side. Then, the squirrel was gone, and in its place stood a wolf, tall and menacing. \n \n `` Are you a shape-shifter?'' Jam inquired, taking a small step forward. I glared fire at him, silently willing him to shut his mouth before he got us killed. \n \n The wolf, however, laughed, as well as a wolf could laugh, and flicked his tail back and forth. `` A shifter? Ha! Those things are about as real as the humans you're going after. No, Mr. Big-Teeth, I was cursed.'' \n \n `` Cursed?'' Jam echoed at the same time that I asked, `` Have you been following us?'' \n \n The wolf licked his lips almost hungrily. `` Maybe. It's not everyday an elf and an orc wander into faerie territory. You know how dangerous it is here? How old are you?'' \n \n I cut Jam off before he could utter another word and sighed. `` Yes, we know. We just need to find the humans.'' \n \n `` Why would you ever need to come face to face with those vile, destructive creatures?'' The wolf pondered, a wolfish smile twisting his lips. \n \n `` Because our home is being invaded as we speak, and we need to get the humans' help-'' \n \n The wolf shook his head and cut me off. `` Yeah, yeah, you want their technology, I figured as much. Well, looks like it's your lucky day, Gold-Skin, because I happen to know a guy who knows a guy that just might be able to help you.'' \n \n `` Really?'' I said sarcastically, ignoring the'Gold-Skin' part. `` And you'd help us, just like that?'' \n \n `` Of course not, you long-eared idiot, I want something in return.'' \n \n `` Oh?'' \n \n The wolf looked around for a minute, as though he were making sure that no one else was listening in. Then he turned his silver eyes to mine, dead serious. \n \n `` You have to help get this curse off of me.'' \n \n It seemed too easy of a deal, but the seriousness of his voice was not like the empty promises I've heard back home. I wondered why he was so quick to jump on the opportunity to help two complete strangers that are n't even where they're supposed to be, but if he was truly cursed, then I suppose he had a reason. I looked to Jam, who simply smiled and shrugged, letting the decision fall to me. Sometimes I hated being the decision-maker. \n \n `` Fine.'' I groaned, rolling my eyes, `` You have a deal.'' \n\n"}

His glasses framed beady, wet eyes which narrowed and widened like gills. His hair was a great oil slick spilled into a bone-white ocean. It lay close to his scalp, glistening in the garish halogen light. His eyes flickered towards the nearest exit with a speck of what could have been hope, as though he might find an answer there. \n \n \n `` I would like to apply for an immediate induction into those foul, drunken, gloriously incompetent denizens of the mortal coil. Form A1-E1, if I'm not mistaken. You have the forms. Is there a particular purpose for your delay?'' \n \n \n The teller gave half a laugh that tugged the corner of his lips into a grotesque smirk before it quivered back to a submissively clueless expression. A bead of sweat formed on his left temple. He gazed once again at the door and may have given a bit of a sigh. His eyes were the sort of green you might find at the corner of a recently fouled gutter. His voice was halting and strained, as though each syllable had to fumble blindly for a moment before tripping into the next one. \n \n \n `` I see, ah, well... ah. You are... that is to say, you are, well... Death.'' \n \n \n A Man sat opposite a desk from the teller, right leg folded, foot resting easily on his left knee. Grey eyes peered steadily out from beneath thin, dark eyebrows like the reflection of a cloudy day off of a frozen lake. One of those eyebrows raised now. \n \n \n `` Goodness, am I? And here I am thinking I only had a terribly impressive handshake! Why, this explains **so** much. My existence's mysteries unveiled. Truly. Astonishing. Thank you.'' Each word was so dry that the teller found himself growing thirsty. The Man's hair was pulled into a long, thick gray ponytail braided intricately down the back of an exquisitely tailored suit. Thin scraps of black paper were woven into the braid, each of them bearing a single name. Some of them burned, snapped and smoked. Others fell periodically as ash. Still more seemed to emerge from the braid itself, born out of nothing. \n \n \n `` Did you not hear me?'' The Man leaned forward slowly. `` I said,'Thank you'.'' \n \n \n `` I did hear you, ah, I only, erm. You're welc-'' \n \n \n `` It was not sincere,'' His voice cracked through the teller's like a shattering mountain, `` I have told you my request, I have been most civil, will you fulfill my need? Or must I find another who can? I must wonder, if I should need to seek out another what is your purpose here at all? Certainly not for conversation.'' \n \n \n `` I, ah... um,'' the teller stammered and the sweat on his brow became a multitude, a cascade of nervous perspiration. The teller snatched clumsily for a pocket handkerchief at his breast and dabbed with what he hoped was some semblance of dignity. `` Most, ah... certainly not. Sir. Death, sir, ah, let me call my supervisor. I'm... ah, sure he'll be able to help you.'' \n \n \n `` Wondrous.'' \n \n \n The teller picked up a depressingly featureless phone and brought fat fingers crashing down haphazardly on oily keys. He waited a moment. There was a buzzing from his ear and he began to mumble a rapid and incomprehensible slew of words which may or may not have contained the phrases `` help me'', `` Malach HaMavet'', and `` pretty, pretty please''. Those wet eyes slowly peered up. The Man was staring at him. Coolly. Unmoving. The teller found his breath catching in his throat and gave a cough which sounded suspiciously like `` hurry''. The phone was lowered with a click. The Man's scrutiny never wavered as the teller awkwardly found a place on his desk to lay his hands. His fingers trembled as he folded them. He gulped. Like a thoughtful dedication to every moment wasted, a clock ticked off the seconds. \n \n \n `` You know, I've always hated that nickname,'' breathed the Man. His eyes were granite. The teller's eyes were saucers. \n \n \n `` I, ah... which, er which one?'' \n \n \n `` Malach,'' the Man sat back once again, and brought His own hands before Him, laying them one over the other delicately. `` All of them, really. Such nonsense. Grim Reaper, I mean really. Do I appear grim to you?'' The teller stared horrified into the headlights of Death's question. The truth was on his traitor tongue, and so he clamped his teeth together so hard that his cheeks began to ache. `` Harvester of dusky disposition at my worst. The arrogance. As though I can be summarized into some grand, grandly insulting caricature. Like some sort of humanoid, convenient constant for the masses to follow. As though I have some form that steps into their pointless stories.'' \n \n \n `` Do n't, ah, do n't you have a form, though? The form, ah, you, uh... currently...'' \n \n \n Flint struck steel in the Man's gaze. The teller wished with all of his might for the ability to melt into cheap polyester. \n \n \n `` This form, you must mean? I'm terribly sorry, but deciphering meaning from you is rather like trying to identify a pleasing aroma in a compost heap. If what I were searching for lay there it would be impossible to find for everything useless that surrounds it. Do you want to hear the truth?'' The Man smiled, the teller immediately wondered what inhumane means might exist for eradicating a memory and who he might ask about it. `` The truth is that I am all of them and none of them. I am everything and nothing, and I am the punctuation that separates the two. Life is, life does, but life is disgustingly reckless, unpredictable, and disorganized. I am the constant.'' Slowly the Man stood and leaned over the teller's desk. `` Very few things *truly* are. **Everything** ends.'' \n \n \n `` S... Sir?'' \n \n \n The Man turned his head toward the offending squeak to find a man who had wasted no time in growing afraid but was trying really very hard to disguise it. Thick brown locks curled over his left temple cartoonishly, stubble on his chin was trimmed meticulously to a uniform 2.5 millimeters. His suit was ill fit but presentable, the sort of outfit which denotes responsibility to someone not entirely ready for it. Inwardly he questioned his life and choices. \n \n \n `` Ah, perhaps in you I might find a man who has retained use.'' The Man stood in one smooth action, like a cat leaping into a pool of mercury. He strode confidently toward the ill suited man. A grin peppered his lips causing his cheeks to crinkle. In the dull, uniform light his jaw was long and gaunt. `` I wish to apply for an immediate transfer into the ranks of the living. I wish to stride on the sandy beaches, I wish to smell the lavender of a poorly made candle, I wish to mock the foolish in a voice that they wo n't run from. At first.'' \n \n \n `` I see,'' stated the supervisor. `` Well, you see, there is a complication concerning your current station.'' \n \n \n `` Which station is that? I do so frequently forget.'' \n \n \n The supervisor swallowed the fear which threatened to rise into his throat in the form of a wavering whimper. `` Well, Sir, you are Death.'' \n \n \n `` Goodness, *am I*?!'' the Man's voice rose and the shadows in the room seemed to grow darker, the light dimmer, the air heavier. `` Here I've felt the warmth in every man's last breath and I had assumed I only had dreadful luck.'' He took a step closer to the supervisor, who had to fight his own legs for control as though they were live things in a trap. `` What is your name?'' \n \n \n `` I am... Zacharius,'' the supervisor stammered. The teller stared between them, the unfortunate bystander to an unfolding calamity. He felt like a man watching a tsunami wave, or a thundercloud. He waited for the crash. He waited for the lightening. \n \n \n `` Zacharius, an old one, my. Tell me, Zacharius, what did you do to earn your esteemed position?'' \n \n \n The supervisor opened his mouth but no words came out. He closed it and felt himself deflate. The power he had thought was enjoyable was in fact a figment of his own imagination, he had just realized. `` Murder, Sir.'' \n \n \n `` Murder, yes,'' the Man's voice was broken glass, boulders shifting against one another. `` We've met, then. I remember. You gave her to me, Zacharius, oh, my, yes how you gave her. Your enthusiasm. Your drive was a shining thing, my good man. All flashing steel and crimson fire. Less enthusiastic when I met you for the second time, if I recall. Do you recall, *Zacharius*?'' He stepped so close that Zacharius was forced to look up the crags of Death's visage to meet his gaze. The shadows were obsidian. `` Do you recall how we *met*?''\n"}

I had always meant to ask other atheists and agnostics how they dealt with this fear, but I had never gotten around to doing so -- like so many other things. \n \n But now I was in heaven -- Heaven, even! Standing upon what appeared to be a cloud, the `` pearly'' gates gleamed and glimmered in all the colors of the rainbow, with a silvery, opalescent shine. Below them stood an tall old man. He wore a white robe and leather thong sandals, and carried a shepherd's crook. His hair and beard gleamed silvery white. He nodded at me and smiled. `` WELCOME, MY CHILD. YOU HAVE TRAVELED FAR.'' I could feel His voice in my very bones, as if no ears were necessary to hear it. It was deep, rich, and velvety -- laden with supernatural authority. After a moment, I realized that I had heard this voice many times before. \n \n `` God?'' I asked. He nodded. `` Why do you sound like Morgan Freeman?'' \n \n His laugh was rich, and boomed like distant thunder. `` MY SWEET CHILD, ALTHOUGH YOU ARE AS CLEVER AS ANY OF MY CREATIONS, NO HUMAN CAN WITNESS MY TRUE SPLENDOR. YOU SIMPLY SEE THE PARTS OF ME WHICH YOU EXPECT TO SEE. I APPEAR IN THIS FASHION TO MANY SOULS FROM YOUR ERA. \n \n `` So, you're saying,'this is n't even your final form?''' \n \n `` HUMOR. A COMMON RESPONSE TO FEAR.'' \n \n `` Perhaps I would be less afraid if you were less intimidating and Old Testament-patriarchal?'' At this, God's form began to change, becoming slender and nearly naked, and bearing a strong resemblance to a certain female musician. As She began to speak, I realized that Her voice had softened, as well. \n \n `` All I really want is to make you feel welcome, My child. However, as you ought to know, more dogmatic individuals than you would find the suggestion that I would take this form to be deeply offensive. Ironic, is it not?'' \n \n I nodded, and put one hand in my pocket, feeling far more at ease. `` Perfect. Thank you.'' As I said this, my fingers touched a metal object that I had not noticed before. I pulled a shining silver key from my pocket. \n \n `` Come forth and enter, for yours in the Kingdom of Heaven.'' She gestured to the ornate lock at the center of the pearly gates. \n \n I inserted the key into the lock, turned it, and was rewarded with a deeply-satisfying click. The gates swung open, and then gradually dissolved. We now stood upon a great grassy meadow, bounded by tall hedgerows. It was dotted with trees bearing all manner of fruit, under which lay rocks in the shape of tables and benches deeply-cushioned with emerald moss. Birdsong drifted over us on a gentle wind. \n \n God gestured expansively, `` In the early days of the universe, My rules were harsh. In time, however, I realized that forbidding certain fruits only encourages many of My children to partake of them. In this garden, you may sample the fruits of knowledge as often as you wish. In heaven, the peace of God will always be with you,'' She smiled, `` and also with your spirit.'' \n \n I nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. `` This is wonderful, but I see no other people.'' \n \n `` Yes. This is the oldest part of Heaven. It is now perhaps more of a lobby than a true dwelling place for souls. Nonetheless, it is still enjoyed by many.'' She gestured behind me as she spoke. I turned and saw in the distance a large party of men and women in regency-era attire picnicking beneath an ancient oak. Some laughed and drank wine, while others simply lay in the grass reading and making an occasional comment to their companions. \n \n God continued, `` After creating this first part of Heaven, I realized that many of My aims were at odds with one another. Original sin was a product of this. Instilling my children with both earthly desires and free will meant that few, other than infants, could live a sinless life. When My children began to join Me here, I was faced with a choice: remove the earthly desires that led to their sinning -- essentially making emotionless angels out of men -- or simply accept My children as they were. My love for My children led Me to choose the latter. I love all of My children, sinners though they may be.'' Her smile was like unto a sunrise. \n \n I cleared my throat -- an act which seemed like it should have been unnecessary in Heaven. `` But what about people who have committed grave or cardinal sins, or those whom we might call'evil.' Does Hitler have a place in Heaven?'' \n \n `` For some sinners, I have undertaken rehabilitation programs with... varying degrees of success. Given time, however, even these children will come to understand the error of their ways.'' She began to walk toward one of the hedgerows that bounded the great meadow. `` For My children of what you call the'modern' era, I have devised six circles of Heaven. Each circle represents the range of sins and misdeeds which My children have committed, as well as their virtues. Some sinners are assigned a dwelling place within a given circle. Others, like you, are guilty of a variety of lesser, venal sins -- for which I forgive you -- and are permitted to choose your place of dwelling. All are permitted to travel between these circles, or to the Garden,'' she gestured to the meadow behind us, `` but are returned to their own dwelling each night.'' \n \n This surprised me. `` A curfew? But why?'' \n \n `` While I wish to provide all of my children with their fill of both earthly and heavenly delights, in doing so, it is My desire to gradually free you all from sin without affecting your free will. Your circle and your dwelling are designed to help you in that process. Shall we examine your choices?'' \n \n I nodded, still awed by Her presence, but feeling increasingly wary, as well. \n \n `` Good. Although the choice is yours, I believe that this first circle may be the best fit for you.'' God led me to a gap between two hedgerows. Atop two cigar-shaped pillars, stood an arch that appeared to have been wrought from stainless steel. The shining words appeared to be in every language at once. After a moment looking at them, I squeezed my eyes shut against the sensory overload. Behind my eyelids, I could still read the after-image of the words: `` Tomorrow Land.'' \n \n God placed her hand on my shoulder, and the pain lifted. `` The Ur-language of Babel. You may now read and speak it without further discomfort.'' When I opened my eyes again, I saw the the pillars were made in the form of stylized rockets. God gestured, and we stepped through the arch... finding ourselves in another garden. Before us stood a massive iron-and-glass building twenty stories high, and nearly a mile in length. There were full-size trees and entire streets and `` outdoor'' markets within the greenhouse-like building, and I could make out people in a various styles of dress strolling on balconies and catwalks on the upper levels. \n \n `` The Crystal Palace,'' God said. `` Built in London for the Great Exhibition of 1851 -- though this version is somewhat larger than the original.'' \n \n `` But I thought this circle would be about the future.'' \n \n `` It is. Or rather, it is about the future as My children from the modern era saw it.'' Without having noticed any transition, I realized that had entered the Palace and were now walking down the Grand Promenade. The other pedestrians were dressed in clothes ranging from the Revolutionary-era ( American or French -- I was n't a fashion historian ) to bizarre styles that must have been created decades after I was born. Still others wore garb more appropriate for a steampunk novel or a science fiction convention. Despite God's presence, they seemed to take little notice of us. \n \n I cleared my throat again. `` Please forgive me if this question is impertinent, but what does all of this have to do with sin?'' \n \n God smiled softly -- a candle to her earlier sunrise. As if on cue, we passed a Victorian brothel doing a booming trade. Next door was a raucous tavern advertising gin distilled on-site. Most patrons drank from large crystal tumblers, while a few were engaged in a fistfight that seemed on the verge of spreading to the neighboring establishments -- which consisted of an ale house ( `` Sunday roast served daily! `` ), a cheese shop ( `` Toutes les fromages Europeens! `` ), and the aforementioned brothel ( `` People of every preference welcome! Expert massages and napping areas available!'' ). \n \n We turned a corner and the noise dimmed. God said, `` It is very rare indeed for one of My children to commit only one type of sin. It is common, however, for all of my children to want that which they can not have. For this reason, you might argue that envy lies at the heart of all sins.'' \n \n `` Not pride?'' I asked. \n \n She shook Her head, `` Pride is another matter altogether.'' \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Every time you wake up you are someone different .\n","story":"The alarm clock went off. Time to get started. I hopped off of the mattress that was laying on the floor of a dusty old apartment. Quickly, I searched around for a wallet. Looking down I confirmed that today I was indeed a male. Good, that's what I was used to. \n \n My name is Thomas, and since I was 15 years old, I have gone to sleep and awoken as a different person. I do n't know what happens to the people's souls for the day that I am in their body... maybe they are me for a day. Old me. Thomas. The'me' that I have n't been in 10 long years. \n \n Found the wallet. Gregory Sampson was the name on the ID. Awesome. Where does Greg work? I found a newspaper with circled job offers in it. One of them circled in red ink as opposed to black like the others. Greg's body was tired and weak, but my soul remained strong. For the last four years I had tried to improve my hosts' lives for the day that I occupied their bodies. After about three years I had debated suicide to end this ordeal, but to steal someone's life? I could n't bring myself to do such a thing, so I continued on. \n \n The circled job offer was at 10 am, I was running out of time. Rushing to find Greg's closet I picked up on many aspects of his life. Nice, old golf clubs, a large TV, fairly expensive appliances. Greg was either a former wealthy man or had terrible priorities. I found his closet and quickly threw on the best suit he had. There were many, maybe he really had been wealthy and lost his home. Reduced to this dump. \n \n A quick shower, a decent amount of his cheap cologne and I was off to find this place that Greg wanted to work at so badly. I could feel the pressure mounting. I obviously did n't know Greg, but I wanted to do the best I could at making sure his life would continue as normal or better than before I came along. \n \n Finally I arrived at the building; an expensive looking place. Stayed patiently in the waiting room and was called in after about ten minutes. I opened the door to the office and there she sat behind her desk. The most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I stopped a bit, all confidence I had; gone. I was suddenly nervous and unsure of myself. A deep breath. \n \n `` Mr. Sampson'' She said with a smile. `` Please, have a seat.'' \n `` Thank you.'' I said as I took the chair on the opposite side of the desk. I extended my hand `` Well, a-as you know I am Gregory, you can call me Greg'' \n `` Yes, you told me that yesterday on the phone.'' \n *shit* `` Oh, yes, sorry I forgot.'' \n \n She laughed a beautiful laugh. `` That's alright, and as you know I am Ms. Wever but you can call me Sarah.'' She shook my hand and winked. mischievously. With that my heart-rate skyrocketed. \n `` So shall we get down to business?'' I asked. \n `` Of course.'' She turned her bright blue eyes to her computer screen while clearing a few strands of dirty blonde hair out of her eyes. I watched her every move, like I was studying her for a research project. I wanted to know her, the *real* her. What was Sarah like when she was alone, what was she like around someone she loved and trusted? My mind drifted to the obvious thought of what she looked like naked. Not in a perverted fashion, but in a caring and loving one. I had inhabited enough female bodies that I had become accustom to them, they were no longer interesting for me... but she was different. \n \n `` You're credentials are very impressive Greg. Tell me, why do you think you deserve this position. \n \n The interview went smoothly. I got her to laugh quite often. She even slapped my hand in a playful manner across the desk while laughing after I cracked a somewhat inappropriate joke. I was n't nervous anymore, not in the least bit. \n \n On the way back to Greg's apartment, his phone rang. \n `` Hello?'' \n `` Greg?'' \n `` Ms. Wev- Sarah!'' \n `` You've got the position Greg, can you start Monday?'' \n `` Of course... of course I can!'' \n `` Very well, congratulations, I look forward to working with you.'' \n `` Likewise.'' I hung up and blasted the radio in Greg's car. I was in heaven. \n \n Then, I remembered. This was not my life. I would never see Sarah again, and when Greg came in to work on Monday, he would n't be the same person. He would be Greg, not Thomas. I turned the radio off and drove back the rest of the way in silence. \n \n Upon arriving at his apartment, I quickly ran inside and got to work. I found a pad and paper and began to recite every little detail of the meeting on the paper. After I finished leaving every tip I could think of I left him this one last message. \n \n *My name is Thomas, and my soul has been drifting to a different person somewhere in the world every day for the last 10 years. Perhaps I'll see you again, as a friend of yours, a relative, even Sarah. While it is unlikely, if I do see you, I'll let you know that it is me; Thomas. Good luck in life, and good luck with Sarah if you choose to pursue her. I would die to be you for the rest of my life. It's simple, I'm in love, but as soon as I wake from my next sleep, I will be someone else. Fair well, Gregory Sampson* \n \n It was similar to every other message I left people, but I had never connected with anyone while parading around in someone else's body. I forced myself to go to sleep even though it was only about 1:30 pm. \n \n \n I woke up to the sound of sirens and gunfire *Here we go*\n"}

I turned to meet the person who had said this. \n I was greeted by a short, slender girl in a neon red hoodie with a face filled with freckles and short brown hair with streaks of red. \n `` C'mon! You've never kissed a girl before! Try it out!'' she asked again with a slight whining tone. \n `` But....I do n't... I do n't want to.''

My anger got the best of me, and I did n't realize I was yelling at my sister. \n \n `` Well at least they do n't look like a turd, you fatso!'' Shortly after, she gets up from her seat, leaving behind half of her sandwich. \n \n `` Really? Cause they all look like giant turds to me! Anyway, you gon na finish that?'' \n \n Anna is focusing intensely on her phone, probably texting her friends. As she was walking away from the kitchen, she reply, `` Nope, I'm full. You can eat the whole thing.'' \n \n Being too lazy to get up from my chair, I reach for the sandwich and notice that my scar seems to be in a different place than where it always was. I have noticed it getting closer to my elbow from the forearm, the original location. I'm probably just hallucinating from feeling so hungry. Hopefully the sandwich will satisfy me until lunchtime at school. \n \n *** \n \n `` Ohh! Bacon and eggs, my favorite!'' I exclaim to my mom, and then proceed to devour my breakfast in a minute. `` Mom, I want seconds.'' \n \n `` Tristan, honey, we need to talk,'' she looks at me, and I can see that her eyes are red and watery. Hopefully I'm not in any trouble. \n \n `` About what?'' \n \n `` The doctor called, she said something about your blood pressure, it's too high for a boy your age.'' \n \n `` Mom, screw the doctors.

If you wo n't exercise, then I wo n't ever serve bacon and eggs anymore!'' \n \n `` Fine,'' I reply. She then hands me a plate of broccoli, and expected me to eat it. Out of all the disgusting vegetables, she gives me one of the most disgusting. Whenever she was looking away, I would stash some broccoli in a ziplock bag, to throw away at school. After successfully hiding all the broccoli in the bag, which I hide in my backpack, I handed my plate to my mom, and notice that my scar has moved since yesterday. It is now on my biceps. \n \n After school, I happily walk to my mom to show her the A+ I got on my test. Instead of getting rewarded with game time on my Xbox, she told me to go exercise for at least an hour, unbelievable! I walk out of the backyard and hid behind the tree, she ca n't see me here. After an hour of nap underneath the tree, I notice a stinging pain on my shoulder. My scar has moved again, but this time I feel different. \n \n *** \n \n I feel sick, and I have a very bad fever. Mom said I could skip school today. \n \n `` Tristan, I left food for you on the fridge!'' She yells out before she left to get some more Advil and Tylenol. \n \n `` Okay!'' I reply. The temperature feels really hot, so I take off my shirt and notice that the scar is now on the center of my chest. My stomach growls intensely. Hopefully Mom left me something good to eat. My hopes fell when I see the salad, but soon returned when i see the cool can of soda on the row underneath it. A cold drink would definitely refresh me. I take the can and opened it, then notice that my hands started to shake. As the can came closer to my mouth, my legs weaken, my breathing got heavier, and my heart started beating intensely. My scar starts moving left, closer to the position of my heart, and I feel hotter and hotter. The pain became unbearable, and I can see myself falling to the floor before everything turned dark. \n \n I wake up to the sound of Mom's car entering the garage. I made quite the mess, hopefully she wo n't get mad. As I got up, I noticed that the scar was gone. Within a minute, I quickly wipe the spilled soda, throw away the can, and took the salad out of the fridge. My mom opened the door and quickly say, `` oh good! You're eating your veggies, it's not so bad is it?'' \n \n I take a bite of the salad and reply, `` These are n't bad at all.'' \n \n After enjoying the salad, I asked my mom for permission to go outside. She looks at me with a surprised look on her face. `` If you're up to it, then I do n't see the harm in walking around. The weather outside is just perfect for a walk!''\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] When a person dies , they sing their favorite song until they 're physically unable to .\n","story":"Please be gentle! \n \n With morbid fascination, John watched as his mother passed away. She was n't particularly likeable. In fact, she had always been a pain in the ass, more often than not. This was the woman who had forbade him from participating in band because it was too expensive, choir or drama because it was too feminine, and turned the radio off at every single turn. If his mother had had it her way, John knew that he would have never heard a single note of song in his life. \n \n As she breathed out her last, one of the doctors came in to offer their condolences, before the singing started. There was always singing, it was said. Never had there been someone who did n't start singing the one song that meant the most, the one that would carry on in this world after their death. John had always wondered what would happen in the case of his mother, of someone who hated music with more passion than she could possibly love another human being. \n \n The moment the first notes left his mother's lips, John was transfixed. He had anticipated bad singing, or some cheap country song that focused on someone going to jail after getting drunk. He was n't expecting... \n \n He had never heard the song before, and knew that he was n't like to hear it again. In a solemn, painful way, it pulled at his heartstrings. John wondered how the witch had anything inside of her, at this hour. \n \n He looked over at the doctor, a man almost twenty years his senior, and saw that he held a scalpel. `` I know this must be difficult for you,'' he said over the lament, `` I have to ask, though, do you want her to be presentable for a burial, or no?'' \n \n John shook his head, a tear leaking out of his eye. `` Smash her face in, for all I care,'' he spat. \n \n The doctor stepped past John, and brushed his mother's corpse's hair back, almost tenderly, before raising the scalpel. He made a quick incision, deftly snapping something inside her throat that made the singing stop. He then leaned down and kissed the corpse on the forehead. \n \n `` What the --'' John stammered, before backing up. `` Are you nuts?!'' \n \n The doctor sighed, before answering. `` She never told you about me, did she? I'm Rick Branson, and I wrote that song with her, before she got pregnant with her son. I'm assuming she never did have another child.'' \n \n `` *With* her?'' John asked, startled. \n \n `` We... we went to high school together. Sang together. Did lots of things we were n't supposed to do together. I'm... I'm a little surprised she did n't mention me. All's for the best, I suppose. Let me clean her up, and I'll give you my number. You're how old now, thirty? Thirty-two?'' \n \n John let out a heavy sigh. Of course, he thought. Of course the woman who had given birth to him had neglected to mention to him that she knew who his father was, and that they still lived in the same town. Of course. \n \n He could cry.\n"}

It declared, striding over to where the demon stood trapped, only to trip over its own feet. \n \n The demon snickered.

It cleared its throat. `` Demon, I command you to tell me your name!'' \n \n The demon smiled. `` Get out a quill and some parchment, O brilliant Master of mine. This will take awhile.'' \n \n... \n \n ``... and you need to roll the Rs *just* right, or invoking my name wo n't work. Also all the Ks are silent. And I do hope your throat does n't give out too quickly, otherwise you will have trouble with all the growling.'' The demon paused. `` Are you writing that down?'' \n \n The human growled. `` *Yes*'' \n \n `` Lovely. Now, that was only the first half of my name. The second half is much more complicated and will require you to occasionally speak the demonic language. You *can* speak that, ca n't you?'' \n \n `` Are you-! AARRRRGGHH I GIVE UP!'' The human screeched and flailed its arms around. It knocked over the pot of ink and it spread all over its parchment. \n \n `` Oh dear,'' the demon said. `` We shall have to start over, it seems.'' \n \n The human let out a strangled sob. `` Master was right! I was n't ready to summon a demon! I'm a failuuuurrrreeee!'' It rushed out of the room, sobbing its frail little heart out. \n \n `` Wait, you have to dismiss me or-!'' The demon groaned. The human was already gone. \n \n Wonderful. Now he would have to wait here, in some tiny little room, until that stupid human came back and released him. With his luck, its master would show up instead and decide it had a use for a demon. \n \n Wait, he could hear footsteps, heading toward this room. The demon perked up. Perhaps that human had remembered it needed to actually dismiss a demon so the demon could leave. \n \n The door flew open, revealing a skinny red-haired human. A human that was very much not the human that had summoned the demon. He was fairly certain this human was female. \n \n The human froze, staring at the demon. \n \n The demon grinned. `` Hello. Care to dismiss a innocent demon who did not deserve to be summoned by an idiot?'' \n \n\n"}

She whispered, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. `` I thought you served as my protection, but you were nothing more than a guard keeping a prisoner in.'' She mused as she clutched a small leather bag in her hands. \n \n The leather bag was old, the once deep brown colour had long since faded to a faint fawn colour, patches of white, cracked leather dotted the bag along its edges. It was the bag she brought with her when she first joined the convent, most of her possessions were taken from her, except for some religious items. Now, as she stood at the gates her bag was lighter than ever, only one pair of clothes sat neatly folded at the base of the bag, her old nuns uniform which she planned to personally dispose of. \n \n She turned around, the faint warm breeze brushing her long ashen hair across her face. With a withered hand she tucked her stray locks behind her ears and gazed back at the convent.

Either way, the Confederation had most of the fertile growing land in the country, and were n't about to give it away. The government could n't really do much about it, they could barely feed their army, forget paying them. By the time they rounded up the soldiers who had n't deserted, the new Confederated States of America already had twenty states under their belts. \n \n The New confederacy only lasted about four years in any case. The Central Confederacy ( or North Rebs as we call them here in Utah ) consolidated their power in Kansas City, and the South Rebs kept their capitol in Houston. After that was the insanity that was the Great Plains War. Rumor has it that you could hear the Siege of St. Louis all the way in Chicago. I believe them too. The images on BBC of the aftermath seemed like it was nothing more than a collection of craters with a river running through it. \n \n After seven years of war, The Virginias and Lousiana split off within a week of each other. The Virginians said they were tired of their people dying over scraps of bombed out pasture and corn fields. Do n't rightly know why Louisiana broke with the South Rebs. The Swampies sure as hell are n't telling. Since declaring themselves a sovereign nation, there's been no broadcasts from them, and the borders are locked tight. \n \n The Great Lakes Union must have decided that after eleven years of half the country tearing itself to bits and the government doing nothing, they'd be better off on their own. They're real friendly with the canucks, trading across the lakes freely. \n \n Less than a year after them, The Republic of Western America declared itself. Washington finally managed to get its shit together and tried to do something, but what could they do? By that point a fifth of the people alive on the continent were in California alone. The one thing they actually competed over was who owned the Rockies. We solved that nicely by saying that we did. Officially we're the `` United States of Utah'', but most of the time we call ourselves the Rockies Republic. They like to scoff because we're the least inhabited country around, and only marginally richer than the North Rebs. They seem to forget that we have the lion's share of the nukes. \n \n After the west left, all that was left of the good old USA was New England. They still fly the stars and stripes with fifty stars though. Kinda sad really.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` I wish I was real . I wish I was alive . But I am neither ... ''\n","story":"The ethereal forms of the dead join me as I make my trek towards the megalopolis of the invaders. They came to this Earth and made it their home, but in that act they killed thousands. The people of this peaceful Earth point pleaded for me to intervene when there was time but I had not. How could I? I had no right to meddle in the matters of the living. This was a conflict between humans. Still, as the war began and blood spilled, I got to know the horrors of war. The natives were not peaceful by any means, however this war was on a level unprecedented. I watched as settlements were wiped out in an instant, soldiers and the families they fought to protect were slaughtered in a systematic fashion by means unknown. It was an inhumane war fought by humans on other humans. Still, I hesitated. \n \n I was close to the borders of the city now, and the ghastly phantoms rose from the mass graves as I passed them by to join me. They marched, forms of all ages. Some had already begun to assimilate once again with the Earth and were losing their shape but it was still easy to tell that they were the souls of humans. Their pain echoed within my mind through the connection that we all shared, and it was that pain that drove me. The spirits began to fade as I got closer to the city and soon the last of them were gone leaving me alone in an unfamiliar world. \n \n When I made it into the city it was bustling with life. People were rushing from one place to another in large droves, all preoccupied with some sort of business. They looked no different from the natives, yet their expressions seemed absentminded. It was strange that these aloof people were the ones devastating the natives who were so proud of their war prowess. Still, I could see what was so dreadful about these humans. Unlike the natives I felt no connection with any of them. Their minds were in disarray and their thoughts occupied with things that I could not understand. They appeared to be lost in their chaotic city, on an endless quest to fulfill their own goals. I felt unbelievable frustration as I realized that while I came here to enact revenge on these humans, I could not find a single one of them to be held culpable. They were all to blame and yet they were not. \n \n They passed me by without noticing me, just like anyone else. I was not a form that a living being could see. I was something else, just a ghost in the wind, a shapeless form of something long gone. In this form I wandered the Earth and was able to witness it's beauty and it's horrors. This was the form I always intended to keep despite my many temptations to intervene. \n \n I made it to the center of the city and finally I felt prepared. Above me, the dark clouds gathered as if on cue. The people were now clearing off the streets and I could faintly sense their presences retreating into the safety of their homes. At last, their thoughts were organized, and the collective emotion was that of fear. Though they could not sense me, they understood that something was coming. \n \n I hesitated. I hesitated because I knew that I would be giving in to a temptation that I've had for as long as I have existed. Intervening in the matters of the living was playing the role of a god, and I knew full well that I was not one. Though the natives had utmost faith in me, I was not within my rights to do what I was about to. The world could be a cruel place yet there was a fairness in it. The living existed in their perpetual cycle, and wherever it took them, it was not my concern. I had no right to direct it's course. \n \n Still, as the rain began to fall and the first bolt of lightning flashed overhead I knew that my hesitation was for naught. I was already here, and even if I changed my mind, the act had already occurred. The storm intensified until I felt as if I were standing beneath a waterfall. Lightning continued to flash and the sky turned darker still as the advent of thunder began to take form. It was a massive, ugly creation, a sphere large enough to resemble the moon, crackling menacingly with the life given to it by it's misguided creator. It's purpose was annihilation. \n \n It descended onto the city slowly and the world turned into silence and a blinding flash as the advent fulfilled it's purpose. I could feel the life being ripped from this city's inhabitants as everything was vaporized without distinction. I trembled from the power, and yet I also knew that this was a turning point. I had trespassed into the domain of the living, and now I would be forever entangled within it. This was a single city, but there were many more. The war would continue and the suffering will never end. I had not solved anything. Still, I also at last felt a semblance of emotion within me. I finally began to understand the humans that I had wistfully observed for so long. Their involvement within the very act of living allowed them to truly exist in those brief bursts. \n \n I wish I was real, I wish I was live. But I am neither. Just a phantom that ached to become human but found itself becoming a weapon. As my vision returned I could see that the city was vaporized. Only a few charred frames of the sturdiest buildings remained. I could n't sense anything alive around me. It was finally done, and yet it was only beginning. I now became the death dealer involved in the affairs of the living.\n"}

That slow cancer had come and glaciers of white replaced the buildings, and palpable sorrow had taken over our people. \n \n \n The sky was blue, a pale blue, but there was more light than usual. I had made my way further than I ever had and the ground was untarnished. Supplies were diminishing as this decade turned and I had to go further and further to survive. I was on the outskirts of what had been farm country in some long forgotten dream ago. \n \n \n The ground was uneven. Hills of white rose and a cold wind picked up. Fallen farm houses lay petrified as their wooden bones stuck out. \n \n \n *I am some animal* I thought. *I steal from the dead. * \n \n \n But I had grown used to the thought. I searched the debris and it was all so unfamiliar. This was from a time I had never known. There were things there that I have never heard of or seen before. Then something caught my eye. \n \n \n An old diary lay frozen in the wastes. A collapsed wall still lay upright against the heavy dunes and I was shaded in a long shadow. I picked up the diary and the pages were fragile and mostly disintegrated. What remained was a frost-slick material that was hard to read. I could tell this was from when the cold had begun as the writing on the page was small and economical. Whoever wrote it knew that things were getting scarce. \n \n \n The page I could make out seemed to be written by a small child. I do n't know why I wasted time trying to read it, but all the answers in the world were kept there. Children are often the bravest when fear takes the men. \n \n \n'Today the monster roared. It was a big roar and it shook our house. He is waking up. It is sunny now and he likes the sun. Mommy used to tell me stories about him. He was asleep for a long time. Now the sun is coming out and he is waking up. I do n't understand. The sun is out everyday. Maybe he was having a long sleep and his mommy and daddy did n't want to wake him. I heard him roar today so I know he is awake. I wonder if mommy will let me see him. I think he is scary but mommy said he was n't. She looks scared herself so I think she was making that part up. I hear him roar again.' \n \n \n I do n't know why it took me. My legs numbed and I got up to stretch. The world around me was quiet and white. Our world was dead and this slow cancer was eating away at it. In my studies when we had the luxury to do so, we discussed this coldness that had taken us. The commonly accepted explanation was that it was natural, a cycle and eventuality. But in the dark though, if you were in the right circles, there were other theories. Sinister conspiracies. \n \n \n I ca n't say that I am a theorist, and I do n't have much to add to any scientific research, but I have always wondered of the cold. The stories of long ago speak of a people that could achieve anything. They speak of a people who aimed to be Gods themselves. I always wonder why such a people would allow this to happen. I always wondered why no one tried to do anything about it. \n \n \n I walked back the long trek home and I thought of the page I had left behind. It seemed unfitting of me to take it. \n \n \n *I'm not that beastly, * I thought, and I thought of what was written. \n \n \n I thought my private thoughts and I wondered what really happened so long ago. What could make such an advanced people so silent, unwilling to fight. Was this cold man made? Was it really made to put this monster back to sleep? What could be worse than this slow death? I looked around again and there was nothing but the cold snow. Such thoughts are childish, but I wondered if somewhere out there something was sleeping. I wondered if I would ever hear the roar. It gnawed at me, but I had other things to worry about. I took my supplies back to my camp. I would survive another day. \n \n\n"}

Said the cold must've slowed my heart down and reduced brain damage. \n \n Since that time I've been shot, stabbed, fell to my death, blunt force trauma -- really the list could go on forever.

That's the point at which your body begins to deteriorate, or so I've been told. \n \n I managed to stick under the radar for so long.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The Mexican-American War never ended . Mexico has been secretly sneaking soldiers in the US by going through the border and pretending they 're illegal immigrants . Its 2020 , the war began as a shock .\n","story":"You know, the border states never really expected it. I mean, at that point, one in every five, maybe six, was an immigrant, illegal or not, from Mexico. We asked them to do the shit jobs. Manual labor intensive jobs. \n \n By 2020, the American public as a whole seemed to have forgotten about the rising crime statistic in the border states related to drug violence. We were caught off guard when suddenly, every town and city within 50 miles of the border suddenly fell to very well trained Mexican gangs. La Muerte Negro. Turns out that the gangs of Mexico had united with the desperate government. Also hailed officially as `` The New Mexican Military'', La Muerte Negro was a mix of special operations, prisoners from every level of the justice system and ordinary gang bangers. They fought a damn good war of Insurgency. \n \n Of course, the US could n't, *wouldn't*, let an upstart second or third rate country like Mexico steal away it's land. Despite Marine units in Southern California being nearly decimated and Camp Pendleton being surrounded, \n'the New Khe Sanh' as several newspapers reported, and significant losses to the National guard from the surprise attack, The US Pushed back. \n \n City fighting became terrible. The marine corps took responsibility for California, and the fight in LA is still remembered as the most intense house to house fighting, Topping Hue and Fallujah. Marine units pushed all the way to the border of California, reliving a severely destroyed Pendleton and rescuing the remaining survivors. \n \n At the Same time, national guard units, supplemented by the fullest weight of the US army, pushed back along Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. US 10th Mountain Division was deployed along the path of the rockies and swept down to the border. At the same time, US Paratroopers and Rangers Parachuted into San Antonio under operation Dead Drop. \n \n US armored cavalry divisions overran most of New Mexico's defensive line in a week, Arizona Fell shortly afterward. The only hold up in the operation was In Texas, where the Paratroopers and Rangers were having a tough time with some of the more elite units of la Muerte Negro, still in what was being dubbed'the San Antonio Pocket'. Armored support from louisiana was redirected from the border to the Pocket, and managed to crush the last of the resistance active in the US. \n \n Of course, this would not stand. The order was given in October of 2020, some three months after the first strike at US Soil. Marine Units rapidly cleared the Baja peninsula, and it is unfortunate to say that all Mexican citizens were detained in camps, similar to Japanese citizens in WWII. The US 1st and 2nd Army swept into Mexico,'Liberating'' Chihuahua, Sonora and Coahuila De Zaragoza. US Airborne, Rangers, Green Berets and a detachment of Delta Parachuted into Mexico City in the Largest Airborne operation since WWII. They succeeded in capturing Mexico's president, and the Majority of the leaders. \n \n ~~Under the San Antonio Resolution, Baja, Sonora, Chihuahua and Zaragoza became US Territories.~~ \n \n Edit: Sorry everybody, I was running late for a final and had to bang out an ending real fast, here's the revised ending: \n \n Under the San Antonio Accord, The Baja Peninsula became part of California, Sonora, Chihuahua and Zaragoza became an Independent Incorporated US Territory of Villa. Mexico was thrown into disarray, A little more than a year saw a solid first strike turn into an outright defeat. As a result of the loss, Mexico's economy sank lower than ever, with exchange rates of 1 USD to 10 MP before it skyrocketed to 50, then 100. Unable to pay soldiers or the majority of employees, Mexico dissolved into warring states in 2025.

{"prompt":"[ EU ] Pokemon battles are now part of the olympics\n","story":"The President smiled as he waved. Smiled and smiled and smiled, his face lit up by the endless strobe of flashes and the cascade of camera clicks. It never seemed to end. It never should end. Not after what he'd announced. Not after what he'd done. They'd be talking about this forever; no, they'd be talking about **him** forever. The thought of it spread a warm tightness in his chest and helped him to hold his eyes open, even as the stinging and the blindness from the flashing became almost unbearable. \n \n `` Mr President, it can't-'' \n `` Dmitri, I do n't want to hear it.'' \n It was 10 minutes before the press conference, and Dmitri felt sick. And not in a good, too-much-vodka-the-previous-night, kind of way; this was a much more oh-sweet-merciful-God-please-let-this-be-some-kind-of-cosmic-joke bout of nausea. He could n't be serious. He could n't be f***ing serious. Even for him, even for the President, this was a level of such absolute stupidity and disconnection from all things reality that he could n't possibly be- \n `` I'm serious Dmitri, and I want it done. I do n't care what it costs or what we have to do. It will happen.'' \n `` But Sir, they don't-'' \n `` It will be a part of the games Dmitri.'' \n `` It's not-'' \n `` The best part of the games.'' \n `` It does n't even-'' \n `` **My** part of the games.'' The President's eyes narrowed, and Dmitri's futile protests curtailed into a gulp. `` My idea. The greatest addition to the games in their entire history.'' \n The aide tried in vain to speak. `` Sir, it can't-'' \n `` I do n't want to hear'ca n't' Dmitri,'' the President cut across him with a wave of his hand, `` I just want to hear'done'. Do I make myself clear?'' Dmitri could only stand there, trying hard not to look aghast. The other man gave a curt nod, then turned and walked away. \n Well, thought Dmitri. He stared glumly at a chip of paint peeling off the wall. Guess it was time to resign oneself to one's inevitable death. \n \n After the announcement was made, the press went into a frenzy. Such a thing was unheard of, stretching the limits of disbelief, borderline insane. People called it a joke, a farce, a symptom of crippling mental instability; they dismissed it, pointed out the logical flaws, or even took it as an insult. Mostly though, they just laughed. Laughed and laughed and laughed, in every home and every forum and every talk show in every corner of the world. It was a free meal ticket to every comedian in the world, and it was all directed at them; the Glorious, Ridiculous, Monumentally-Insane Nation of Russia. \n \n And through it all, the President stood firm. He never backed down, never did anything that made it seemed like he had even the faintest flicker of a doubt. He believed, and nothing anyone else in any lesser country said could shake him of that belief. And it was that unwavering focus, that untouchable faith, that made a lot of people stop, maybe for only a second, and wonder. Surely. Surely not. It's not possible. He could n't be telling the truth. But... maybe. Maybe, just maybe, he'd done it. Maybe, just maybe, they could pull this off. \n \n And so it fell to Dmitri. Mere months before the Opening Ceremony, with who-knows-how-many other problems, failures, and uncompleted organisational train-wrecks already looming high over the Games, Dmitri was charged with doing the impossible. \n \n He was to create Pokemon. \n \n Real, actual, breathing, fucking, battling, name-squealing Pokemon, just like the ones in those motherf*cking video games, games which Dmitri damned for ever having existed with every waking moment of his ever-decreasing lifespan. They had to exist, and they had to exist in time for the games, or otherwise, said the President, he would be **very** displeased. And Dmitri knew exactly what that meant. Either he'caught them all', or the back of his head caught a bullet. Probably 151, just to be poetic. \n \n He approached the science department first. They'd laughed uproariously at him, right up until he pulled out his cellphone, dialled the President, and told him that the science department had personally guaranteed him that they could have the Pokemon ready in time for the games. Then the laughter abruptly stopped, and terrified looks were shared by all except Dmitri, who was simply out of fucks to give by now. If I'm going down, he explained to them, then so is each and every fucking one of you. After that, they became substantially more helpful. \n \n Unfortunately, helpful did n't necessarily translate into `` Pokemon'', in the same way that `` terrified'' did n't translate into `` Pokemon.'' Because nothing fucking translated into Pokemon, as it soon turned out, because Pokemon did n't exist and would never exist even if they somehow managed to make every technological breakthrough scheduled for the next century in a week and a half. Still, they tried. They electrocuted a few rodents with batteries sewn hastily under their skin, and they threw any number of animals into nuclear reactors. They tried gene-splicing everything they could get their hands on, and ended up with a lot of small piles of dead goop; which, with a flash of insight, an intern mixed in with a tin of purple paint and tried to label as `` Grimer'', but which in reality was fooling no one. Then they tried nuclear waste, then abandoned nuclear submarines, then nuclear fuel rods, because if there was one thing Russia had an abundance of, it was crappy nuclear-related paraphernalia. And snow. May as well give snow a shot. They tried gluing snow to the biggest bird they could find and then spraying it with a misting hose in the Siberian cold; but no, that did n't work either ( not that they'd really held out high hopes about that one ). \n \n They did have mild success in recreating a Spinda, by getting a small bear, shaving and tattooing it, then force feeding the poor thing as much vodka as it could handle. But even that was more failure than victory; sure, the creature stumbled and weaved fairly accurately, but it also steadfastly to follow trainer commands and spent most of its time throwing up a lot. So that was at best tucked away into the `` Maybe'' pile.\n"}

An observer would be forgiven for thinking she had been hurt, but there was no mistaking the way it stained her lips and face. \n \n I folded my ears back in guilt. She was far too young for this. I had hoped to keep the truth hidden from her until she was older. Until she was ready to face the real terrors of the world. I glanced at the dead mercenaries who had taken that chance from me and growled. \n \n My daughter gasped at the noise, and I immediately rushed to her side, trying to comfort her even as I knew I was responsible for her fear. I brushed up against her and she grabbed me, pulling me tight into a hug. We fell together onto the bloodstained carpet, with her arms around me and her face buried in the fur on my neck. I whined in concern, but continued to lay still so she had something to hold. I heard her begin to cry. \n \n After what seemed an eternity, she loosened her grip on me. I rolled over until I faced her and saw that she had sat up, still rubbing tears from her eyes. I got up gently so as not to scare her, then gently nuzzled her arm. She moved it aside and I began licking her face, trying to clean her as much as comfort her. For a moment, I was afraid I had lost her, but then she began to stroke my back as if I were a dog. \n \n I finished with her face and tried to start on the rest, but she pulled back from me. I lifted my head and sat down, looking at her. She trembled a bit as she looked at me with wide, golden eyes, and I silently cursed at myself for being what I was. There was nothing I could do to help being a monster, but knowing that did n't make me feel any less guilty. \n \n `` Daddy?'' She said in a shaky, quiet voice. Even despite her fear, it came out more like a growl than the voice of a young girl. `` Are we the bad guys?'' I dropped my head and folde my ears back in guilt. I would n't know how to answer that even if I could have spoken. I turned, hating myself as much as I did the mercenearies scattered on the floor and walls. \n \n I wanted to leave, but my daughter, my brave little daughter, caught my tail. I stopped and stiffened as she came up to me. She was scared, but the expression on her face was resolute. She said to me, `` No.'' I looked her in the eyes, unsure of what she meant. `` They killed mommy, did n't they?'' I looked at her with sad eyes. She was too young to understand, or so I had thought. \n \n `` You tried to protect mommy. She died because she was n't... like us.'' I looked away. She had been too young when her mother had died. I had killed the men that did it, just like tonight, but it had been too late to save her. `` They wanted to hurt us because we're different, did n't they?'' I stiffened at that. I looked up, wishing I could speak so that I could apologize to her, but she had that same expression her mother always had. It was the face she had used when she told me I was n't a monster. I never told her, but I had n't believed it. \n \n `` They came to our house to kill us. That makes them the bad guys.'' She was brave. I wanted to tell her that it was n't black-and-white. I wanted to tell her that we were monsters. I wanted to tell her, but she was too young to know such things, and I could n't speak as a wolf anyway. Most of all, I did n't tell her because I wanted her to be right.\n"}

A question from young Tweyinn was usually followed by a short lesson in what happens outside of a Okuran temple. Curtis sighed as the young rookie beamed at him like a curious five year old. The rest of the crew snickered as they tapped panels and tablets running through monotonous tasks. He turned to Quinn, hoping that the medical officer could bestow some of her motherly wisdom on the child of their crew. \n \n `` I think I have to inventory some blood samples.'' Quinn glided through the hatch of the bridge, dodging the glare Curtis flashed at her.

Curtis wondered what the rowdier members of his crew were filling this kid's head with. \n \n `` Some drugs are somewhat like alcohol, they can relax you or stimulate you.'' Curtis rambled through his grade school memories of a colonial peace enforcer addressing the classroom. `` They can alter brain chemistry, causing the user to experience different effects.'' \n \n `` Are these drugs prescribed by a physician?'' \n \n `` No, not all the time.'' \n \n Tweyinn's eyes widened, his antennae flaring slightly. \n \n `` One should not tamper with the brain so lightly.'' Tweyinn's words had the slight edge of one entrenched in a belief. `` Your own people say that the body is a temple.'' \n \n `` And yours say the brain is the god,'' Curtis rubbed his temple `` We know, and not all humans say that.'' \n \n `` It is a sensitive organ, no matter the species.'' \n \n `` That's true, but not all recreational drugs are the same. Some have milder effects while some should be avoided completely.'' \n \n `` Which do you think are safe to try?'' \n \n `` I would n't say that you should...'' \n \n `` Have you tried them, sir?'' \n \n `` What?'' Curtis swung in his chair. \n \n `` Yes, Captain,'' Grelling crossed his bulky furry arms, grinning mischievously `` Tell us your experience to better shape the young minds of this crew.'' \n \n Curtis pointed a finger at the console infront of Grelling, the beast shrugged and continued typing. \n \n `` Once you get to a certain age, you want to try things out because other people tried them.'' Curtis picked through his memories, deciding what to tell the young crewman. `` Sometimes it livens up a dance with a beautiful girl. Other times it can land you naked in a ditch.'' \n \n `` Bizarre.'' \n \n `` That's life when you take those risks, but you have to be careful because you ca n't just take what's handed to you.'' \n \n `` I do n't...'' \n \n `` I mean just because you want to try to fit in does n't mean you have to force yourself to do anything.'' \n \n `` I'm not certain what that means, sir.'' \n \n Curtis ruffled his hands through his hair. \n \n `` Neither do I.'' He lifted himself from his seat, surprisingly exhausted. `` I'm going to get some coffee.'' \n \n Curtis began walking out of the bridge, stopping short of the door. \n \n `` If anyone offers you something you do n't know about down there, just say no.'' Curtis offered the simple advice handed down for centuries. \n \n `` And stay in school.'' Grelling piped in.

Did I just die? I ca n't see anything, everything's just black... \n \n The fuck? \n \n Some horrible screeching noise was pinging around in my brain and my ears. Kinda like metal grinding on metal. I can see flashes of light that used to be there burned into my eyes, like what the sun looks like when you close your eyes. There's another layer of sound... glass shattering into a million tiny shards. Is someone throwing pennies at me? It smells like copper in here, wherever I am. In my right hand, I can feel the glittery ridges on my phone case and my thumb on the home button. Okay, well that's good, I'll call someone and figure out what the hell is going on. In my left hand, I can feel the grooved impressions of my steering... \n \n Oh. OH. \n \n Note to self: do n't text and drive. \n \n Suddenly, as if I'm some video game character spawning into a level or some shit, I get dropped down onto this tiny rocky island in the middle of a cavern.

I whip around to see lava -- seriously, lava? What a clich\u00e9 -- filling the room and almost sweeping me off my island. My island morphs into a slightly bigger island, and with a poof of smoke, a secretary at a fiery desk plops down. Wow, she's smokin'... Oh, she's actually on fire. \n \n She asks for my name and my date of birth. Her long manicured nails start tapping away on her keyboard, faster than I've ever seen anyone type before. I try to ask her what the hell is going to happen to me, but she puts a finger up to shush me and continues typing. It feels like I'm at a doctor's office: the waiting room is unbearably stuffy, and the receptionist is rude. Is this what hell is?

Your case is... special.'' \n \n She pauses, maybe to get my reaction?

Well shit yeah, okay, send me back! I must have some good karma saved up. \n \n `` Nope! Beam me up Scotty,'' I joked. She laughed, but it did n't seem like she was laughing at my joke.

She gave me one last look with a knowing smile on her face and one eyebrow cocked, and hit her return key. I blinked, and my vision went white. It felt like I was being sucked into a vacuum, there was ringing in my ears, and then... \n \n `` *DAD! * Can I play games on your phone?'' \n \n `` Tucker James!

I'm just saving your life, you're welcome. \n \n Finally, the light turns green. We start to roll though, like we've done a million times before. \n \n Then, I hear a sound no parent ever wants to hear: Tuck screams for me, louder than I've ever heard him scream before. In that moment, it feels like time slows down to a halt. My eyes shoot to look back at him -- Damn it! His seat belt is still off! Then, I notice a bright red Pontiac blowing through their red light and charging towards us, right into Tuck's door. The driver looks familiar... Did I know her in college?

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A magical mirror shows your reflection and your future soulmate . You only see your reflection .\n","story":"Soulmates. \n \n Less than a dozen years ago, that term would be at best used to describe a happy couple. That was before the advent of divination and the rise of the first mages. \n \n I say first, though that is inaccurate. It's unclear if mages had existed at any point prior to the development of reliable divination methods. The fact is that one could meet one's perfect match, and even dedicate one's life to that person, long before we developed the technology to accurately identify the individual. The fact is however that the chances of truly meeting your one true other, the other half of your soul, is so infinitesimal that even with the use of Divination Glass, one is highly unlikely to ever find them. An accurate description is not enough, it's simply too unlikely to ever see them in a sea of nine billion human faces. \n \n Yet, those that do are gifted with greatness. Once one can complete one's soul, one becomes gifted with awesome powers. Flight, teleportation, matter manipulation, these are but fragments of the capability of a mage pair. \n \n Scientists are not entirely sure of the exact origin of these powers. What we do know however is that the energy used to fuel this'magic' is derived from the energy generated from the proximity of two halves of a soul. Energy is generated, albeit almost imperceptibly, between two halfs of a soul all the time. It can not be artificially generated, and if one half of a soul is lost, so to are the powers. \n \n The first known mage pair were Arthur and Melissa Dillinger. They met in Quebec, one from Turkey, the other an American from New York. They fell in love, and after their first night together, they found they could fly. Their powers only grew from there. They were the ones who developed the Divination Glass. They learned to identify this strange energy that connects two people. They developed a means that for a fraction of a moment, those two could be connected in a way, and one could get a glimpse of one's other half. \n \n It's odd to imagine, but not a single soul mate pair has been unhappy with their partner. Even with language barriers, every mage duo has been a perfect couple. The success of these relationships, not to mention the awesome powers, brought people in droves to look into the Divination Glass. More were developed, and ten years after the Dillingers rose into the skies, it became ritual for those who were of age to go and peer into the glass on their eighteenth birthday. \n \n This is where the story comes to me. \n \n I shuffled awkwardly in the line. I had n't been looking forward to this day. For the last two years I have been in love with my next door neighbor and best friend, Petunia. Pet for short. Ever since she introduced me to Halo 6, and taught me to play Warcraft 4, I have been head over heels for her. Nothing in the world would make me happier than to look into that mirror and see her. \n \n But I knew there was no way. \n \n I already knew what I would see. I would look into the mirror and see a girl in tribal clothing, holding a spear. She would live in some untapped part of the rain forest and I would never meet her. I was too mundane for powers, and I was far too unlucky to ever have the girl I love be my soulmate. \n \n Now I do n't want you to get the wrong idea, it's not like I did n't try. I told her two years ago, right before Divination Glass became the norm, exactly how I felt about her. She had only the day before read about the new public availability of Divination Glass, and she asked that I wait. So I had, hoping the entire time I could get my feelings to change. \n \n They had n't, and there we were, celebrating our birthdays by standing in a queue to see our soulmates. I would have been glum if her exuberance was n't so infectious. She's like that, you know. She is so passionate about everything, and she really gets you excited too. Even if it's being excited about queuing. \n \n The boy before Pet walked out, his brow furrowed in confusion, not even looking up to us as he walked away, and Pet turned to me. \n \n `` It's finally going to happen. I'm finally going to know.'' She said, her grin so wide as to look manic. \n \n `` Next please,'' came the voice of the black armoured attendant. \n \n `` Wish me luck, and just so you know-'' she leaned in close, `` I hope it's you.'' \n \n With those words ringing in my ear, she dashed inside. I do n't think I could breathe. I felt my heart in my throat, and time seemed to drag on for an eternity. In truth, it must have been seconds before I heard a scream of delight. \n \n She ran out, fanning herself frantically and bouncing up and down, her coppery red hair fanning out wildly as she struggled to speak. \n \n `` Oh my god!'' \n \n For a moment, I smiled. \n \n'It could n't be.' I thought to myself.'I'm not so lucky.' \n \n `` It's Chad Malcovitch! THE ACTOR! He is like the sexiest man alive! And only a year older than me! I was so worried it'd be some creepy old guy but it's CHAD MALCOVITCH!'' she screamed as she continued her bouncing dance. \n \n I had expected my heart to sink, but apparently, I had prepared myself well. Though I still wished it had been me, I was happy for her. She knew who he was. Surely he would recognize her as well. She had received something very few people had, she would be gifted and happy. I still loved her, but I was happy. \n \n `` Next.'' The black armoured figure beckoned towards me. \n \n My eyes fell on the entrance to the dark room, and I grimaced. \n \n `` Good luck. Maybe it'll be Jessica Tatum!'' Pet told me, her voice flooding with encouragement. \n \n Somehow I could n't really feel her excitement. \n \n I walked into the room. \n \n `` Just look into the mirror. Your soul mate will appear exactly where your reflection should be.'' The dark figure told me, and then retreated to a side room to operate some manner of control. \n \n For a second time, I felt that I could n't breathe, and then the lights came up. \n \n In the mirror, I saw myself. Not someone who looked like me, but myself, the same scars, the same clothes, even the same glasses. \n \n `` Uh, something's wrong.'' I called to the back. \n \n `` No, it's not. It shows you the person holding the other half of your soul. Nothing else to it. I do n't care if they're not attractive enough for you, or if they're the wrong race, or whatever, I hate excuses like that. That person has the other half of your soul. Simple as that.'' Growled the armoured attendant from the side room. \n \n I cocked my head. \n \n And then, suddenly aware of exactly what this meant, reached inside myself. I poured all the rage and confusion and hurt from loosing Pet into my open palm, and a tiny flame sprang fourth. \n \n `` Huh.'' I said. \n \n `` Everything okay in there, Dylan?'' Pet called from outside. \n \n `` Yeah.'' I called back. \n \n And you know what? It kinda was.\n"}

It flapped smoothly across his well-defined pecs, curling around his thick arms, while strands lightly lay across his muscular back and caressed his well-defined calves. He landed on the roof of the city building, his flexing his 8 pack, and gazed over the city with the night vision his golden-yellow eyes granted him. His city. He jumped again, this time landing in front of an attractive brunette. `` Hey there.'' Willy said, and as he spoke his hardened jawline and small scar on his chin could be easily seen. `` I'm Willy.'' \n `` I'm Katie.'' The woman said, swooning. It was n't long before they were making passionate love in the bathroom. \n Meanwhile, I stood outside of the motel with my crutches, listening to the rhythmic thumping of my twin having sex with the girl I had a crush on. It was kind of calming. Not much is constant in life, but the thumping was. Another constant was my brother fucking every girl I was interested in. \n Willy made love to Katie passionately. She moaned in pleasure. He lasted longer than any other man Katie had been with, and provided her with greater happiness than she had ever felt. His body up against hers was simply *right*. \n Whenever I heard the thumping increase in speed I knew my brother was almost done. I picked up my crutches and strapped my knee brace back on. On cue, by brother emerged from the motel room, Katie on his arm. She had a look on her face I'd seen countless other times. A look of tired, peaceful pleasure. A look that only Willy can give you. \n Willy looked at me. `` You know the drill.'' He said. I nodded. \n When he and Katie had walked out of sight, I walked into the Motel room and tidied it up. There was a huge recess in the bed where Willy had been thrusting. I crawled under the bed, pulling my hamstring, and pushed up the bottom of the mattress, trying to fix the it. Katie's vagina produced over a gallon of lubricant and it was all over the bed. I dried it up with a hair dryer. I caught sight of myself in the mirror. My blue hair was short and uneven. My eyes were a urine-like shade of yellow. I was scrawny and unattractive, and I had a generally not-symmetrical face. I had really brittle bones and an unbearably short, not-at-all-girthy penis. I was a literal piece of shit. I started to cry, like I do every night, and eventually fell asleep, hoping my tears would drown me and I would wake up in hell, which must be better than cleaning up the vagina-liquid my brother helped make. \n \n Willy climbed up the side of the building, as the evil Bird-Man flew around him. He jumped off, and tackled the Bird-Man, wrapping his strong arms around his wings. His prefect, hourglass torso was tight around the feathers as they fell through the air. The Bird-Man scratched Willy with his sharp claws, tearing his pants open and exposing his tanned, firm buttocks. \n As they hit the ground the Bird-Man screeched. A car exploded not far from them, launching them into the air and into a nearby sandpit. The two rolled around in the dirt, a mass of feathery, muscle-bound-testosterone. I held my high-tech bird-targeting hyperlaser phase-blaster I invented in my unbroken arm. I pulled the trigger and hit the Bird-Man square in the head, killing him. \n Willy emerged from the cloud of dust, sweaty, with a layer of manly grime covering his muscular body. The women cheered his name as I dragged the disgusting, smelly mutant corpse away and to the graveyard, where I would bury him next to the other creatures that wanted to do my brother harm. \n Willy picked six of the most attractive women and brought them to the motel, and proceeded to make sweet, passionate love to all of them simultaneously. The moans of the six women could be heard for miles, along with cries of `` I love you, Willy!'' and `` Your penis is so big, Willy!''. \n That night, I dried up a swimming-pool's worth of sexual fluids from the motel room. I stank of vagina-juice and my brother's seamen, of which he produced copious amounts. I made it halfway home before I broke out in tears, crashed my car, and fell asleep in a ditch, as it rained heavily. I woke up, covered in the piss and shit of homeless people. I crawled home because I lost my crutches, hoping Willy would get out of the shower with Katie long enough for me to take a shower. \n Willy thrusted over and over, the rhythmic thumping everybody had become accustomed to not ceasing. He groaned, pleasure flowing through his veins and all over his naked body. He had never known such pleasure. Nobody was as happy as Willy was that moment. He had never been with somebody that made him so happy. \n I crawled up to the front door. Luckily it was unlocked. I opened it, and crawled, hearing the usual sounds from my brother's room. \n Willy pulled out, and finished. A huge amount of warm, frothy seamen flowed out of his penis, all over his partners body. \n I pulled my body across the floor, towards the bathroom. As I passed the bedroom door, I saw something shocking. It was willy, licking seamen off the abdomen of another man. \n `` YOU'RE GAY!'' I shouted. \n Willy gasped, jizz covering his mouth. `` No I'm not!'' He said. \n `` Yes you are!'' \n Willy tried to shut the door, but it was too late. I had already taken a picture with my high-teck ultra-portable camera built into my broken glasses. I could see the headlines. \n \n > BREAKING NEWS!!! WILLY IS GAY!!! \n If you are a woman, you probably had \n sex with him! Well guess what? He's \n gay! You know who's not gay? Willy's \n brother. \n \n \n Willy knew he only had one option. He ran over to his brother and cracked his skull. \n The world never found out about Willy's gayness and he continued to use thousands of women as a cover-up. He led a very happy, successful life and was never sad. \n \n THE END \n \n \n \n\n"}

Now you face your toughest opponent yet : the crazy cat lady that lives next door .\n","story":"The following is a true story from my days as a grad student at Texas A & M University in the 1970s. I lived just off campus, two blocks straight out the back door of the Dixie Chicken bar. Yeah, the one at North Gate with the rattlesnakes back by the pool tables. \n \n Our old rental duplexes, 7 of them along both sides of 2nd Street, were built around the time of the Korean War, and were built to the standards acceptable to vets returning from Frozen Chosin for graduate studies - cinderblock walls, window AC units, linoleum floors. By the 1970s they were still as decrepit as shortly after opening, but instead of Korean War vets they were rented by guys coming back from Southeast Asia, Vietnam, land of rice paddies and infinite ammo for an AR-15. \n \n One such veteran who lived there was a youth of 22 named Ted, studying for his PhD in Biology. \n \n He was concerned that the crazy cat lady down the street, who fed the feral cats in the neighborhood in her front lawn, was causing real health risks to the community. He asked her to cease feeding the feral cats. She said no. He asked the city to stop her. They shrugged. He asked his neighbors to sign a petition. They went to class and suggested if he was so bothered by the cats he do something about it himself. \n \n So at 9am on a quiet Sunday morning, while the crazy cat lady was at Church and everyone else on the block was asleep, Ted climbed up on the roof of his cinderblock duplex apartment, toting his AR-15, the one that had gotten him out of trouble so many times in Vietnam, the one that he claimed was lost on his last patrol, the one that came back home disassembled in several boxes shipped from the Da Nang PX. \n \n And he shot cats for about twenty minutes. Then he collected all the cat corpses, bagged them up in plastic, and put them out for collection with the rest of the trash on Monday. \n \n The city police eventually arrived, called by the crazy cat lady after she got home and noticed most of her cats were gone, and the officers asked him what the hell he thought he was doing. He told them he was legally shooting vermin - feral cats - in Bryan County, and told the police, quite correctly, that the city limits were one block away. \n \n The police did n't know what to do, so they canvassed the neighborhood and asked residents if they felt threatened by Ted's actions. Nobody did. \n \n One darling old Texas woman, who had lived on our block since the 1930s, whose sons had fought in WWII, whose grandsons fought in Vietnam and were Ted's age, was asked about the shooting by the police. She offered to buy Ted as much ammo as he needed to kill the rest of the crazy cat lady's cats. \n \n True story.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A character kills their narrator .\n","story":"The Plains of Paradox, a place of infinity that does not exist and is all over, is everywhere and nowhere, never was and always is. This place is the home to the woman who watches, the Bound Observer. Her whole life has been lived here in the Plains of Paradox, in a structure called the Impossible Basilica. Impossible though it might be, it exists and at the same time does n't. \n \n It always has though, and never will. This Observer, she does n't exist either, except that she does. She is sitting at a desk currently and typing on a keyboard, and she is very uncomfortable about this fact because she is currently writing about herself writing about herself writing about herself and so on. \n \n The desk sits by the massive wooden entrance doors. Behind her, rows and rows of pews extending to infinity minus one. She glances over her shoulder at the strange sight, staring at the point where it all fades into black obscurity with concern. Laughter rings out from the darkness, echoing off the stained glass windows depicting great heroes and might battles and the polished marble of the walls. \n \n `` How can someone be here?'' the observer hisses, fingers still flying across her keyboard. ``... it's not fucking possible...'' \n \n When she looks back, one of her many monitors is flashing. One hand continues to fly on the keyboard, the other moves to the mouse. She clicks on the screen, trying to get the task manager open, but she finds that all the controls are locked. A command prompt opens and lines of code scroll down so fast even the observer ca n't read them. The low, menacing laugh echoes behind her again. It's a female's laugh, she is sure of it. What disturbs her about it is that she can not see the person. \n \n The observer can not see who is present in her domain. The code finishes scrolling and a program opens up, a chat program. \n \n *'' Hello. `` * \n \n `` What the hell!? How do you keep accessing my system!?'' she demands, her voice adding to the echoes that do not make sound yet never seem to stop. \n \n *'' My dear, I am the Queen of this place. Your mother, your daughter, your sister... all that you are I am and more,'' * the person chatting with her says. *'' You came before me and yet I created you. I came after you and yet you are my offspring. `` * \n \n ``... why... why are you here?'' the observer asks, typing on two keyboards at once. \n \n *'' You asked me to come here. Or will ask me, in the future. Do n't you want a name? `` * \n \n The observer stares at the question. \n \n `` A... A name...? I do n't understand?'' \n \n *'' Are you not a person? Do you not live and eat? Breathe? Do you not gratify yourself when I do, when sexual intercourse is sought out by me? You are made to watch me, because the Fates can not watch me themselves because I exist outside of time,'' * the Paradox Queen replies, laughing out of the dark again, though this time from above. The observer looks up, up to the darkness above. The basilica goes upwards forever, as far as she knows. *'' Do you not want a name? Do you not deserve one? `` * \n \n `` I... I do n't understand...'' \n \n *'' My dear, tonight I die, and tonight you die, as far as the instance of myself that exists in the primary timeline is concerned. I kill myselves to save all existence, to stop myself and stop time from being destroyed. In fact, in some ways, it has already happened, and is happening, and has yet to happen. That is the nature of this place, of Paradox Space, of this the most fragile of realities between behind above and below all other realities. `` * \n \n `` So... So I'm going to die...?'' the observer asks nervously. \n \n The laugh comes again, this time from right behind her. She does n't turn around to look. She knows who is behind her because she can smell the woman's armor, and blood, and perfume and something not unlike red wine. \n \n `` Yes you are, my dear. I know I spoke of our familial relation, but of course we are not actually related,'' the Queen says softly. `` Do you wish to have a name? You have done your job well, and delivered the story of my existence to the Fates in a constant stream.'' \n \n `` Your voice is... so much more beautiful in person than when heard through speakers,'' the observer says breathlessly. `` You would give me a name?'' \n \n `` If you want one, my dear, before together we die finally. Thousands of timelines, centuries of observation... we are closer than close, despite having only spoken a few times. You and I are closer than any other two people can ever be,'' the Queen whispers, brushing the observers pure white, many colored hair aside and leaning down to kiss her softly on her neck, just below her ear. `` May I name you?'' \n \n The observer shivers. \n \n `` Please, my Queen. Name me.'' \n \n The Queen lightly bites down on her ear before answering. \n \n `` Your name is Elise, my dear Bound Observer, and I love you.'' \n \n The observer rises, her hand falling to her pants where a keyboard is clipped. Keyboards and words, they are her life. She has many of them, and unique solutions for constantly recording even when she must leave the Basilica to seek food or to use the restroom. She types even as she turns and faces her Queen. \n \n The woman is so very tall and fearsome. Her hair is short and red, styled up into a fauxhawk. Her eyes do not exist, she gave them up some time ago to see the tree of time itself. They were burnt from her sockets when she peered into the heart of forever. A thin black cloth is tied around her head, covering them. Her face is scarred heavily on one side but it does not mar her beauty. Elise's eyes, a rainbow of colors that do n't exist, flick to her lips. They look so soft, so darkly red and full and perfect. \n \n `` I've known you for so long, my Queen. I think... I think I love you too.'' \n \n The Queen chuckles, resting her arms on the shorter woman's shoulders. Her strange armor is matte black and powered by magic. On her hip, the mighty sword Ravenous that hungers for blood, and on her back the sword Forever that can inflict wounds before the sword is even drawn. \n \n `` What do you want to do now?'' the Queen asks. \n \n `` I want... I want to know what you feel like... against me. Can I... know that?'' \n \n The Queen steps back and spreads her arms. Her armor splits open, crawling like flesh away from her until her naked front half is exposed. On her stomach, a simple crown is tattooed in red. Scars mark much of her body. Her legs and arms are revealed to be synthetic replacements. One particular scar is situated right between her breasts - a surgical scar from a heart replacement. \n \n `` You may have anything you like in these last few hours we share together, my dear Elise.'' \n \n And so Elise too strips her clothing away, a difficult feat while she remains typing. A keyboard is carried with her, wireless, until they reach the place she sometimes lays down on to rest. There is another keyboard right there, next to the mattress on the floor. The women fall upon it and for the first time, the observer - no, Elise - enjoys something she has never enjoyed before. Privacy. \n \n Even as love is made, she types, but slower and fewer words. She gives no detail. This is hers, you understand. This is hers and hers alone! No one else can have this! It belongs to her! \n \n The time passes quickly as their passion burns hotter than a thousand suns. There is not enough poetry in any timeline and in any reality or universe to describe the things that Elise feels. She knows she is in love. She knows she has been in love forever, for her whole existence. She is beyond happy and now the nervousness is gone. She does not feel fear over her impending doom any longer. \n \n When it is done, the monitors over her mattress are watched by both. The Queen faces down a much uglier and much more evil version of herself - another instance of the Queen that is. This is the battle to save time, to save all of reality, but it does n't matter at all because then that instance of the Queen goes back in time with her evil counterpart and they fight in front of the Queen's childhood home. A woman and man open the front door, and the Queen shoots them both in the head. The image freezes and then goes to static. \n \n `` So now you never existed,'' Elise says softly, looking to the Queen. `` It is now over. Time has been saved.'' \n \n `` Yes, my dear. Yes, indeed. I am now dead. I exist only for your benefit, for only a moment longer,'' the Queen replies, leaning in close and kissing her gently on the lips. \n \n `` When you go, will I be alone before I too go?'' \n \n The Queen nods. \n \n `` Indeed you will, my love. But fear not being alone, for when you too fade we will be together in the vast expanse of Never Was, and we can strike out to find what there is to find there. We will be together forever.'' \n \n `` I love you so much. I'm so very sorry about your existence, and having to murder your parents.'' \n \n `` I enjoyed killing them. I'm a monster, remember... had to make myself into this horrible thing to survive so I could kill myself,'' the Queen replies. \n \n `` Do n't... do n't even call yourself horrible. You're beautiful. Perfect... in every single way.'' \n \n The Queen chuckles softly and kisses her cheek. \n \n `` You're too kind. Goodbye, for now.'' \n \n The Queen goes very still then, still propped up on her elbow. Elise ca n't help but cry tears that do not exist but still drip upon the bed as the color drains out of every inch of the woman she loves. Moments later, the Queen is as dust. A wind that does not blow scatters that dust into the lands beyond existence, the lands of Never Was. \n \n She lays back then, waiting for the end to come. Her own Queen has killed her now. She feels peaceful though. There is nothing to fear from her death. Nothing to fear from anything anymore. The end is just another beginning. \n \n Together forever. \n \n A smile graces her face, even as she types. It gets harder to move her fingers to type, but that's okay too. Elise is happy... so very happy. \n \n And now she goes onward as her Queen did, to move forward into the lands of Nev\n"}

The news crews were coming in later today to interview me.....I hope the drones can guide them in without any casualties this time. The volcano lair was... mostly dormant. When I first settled here, I never planned on visitors. At least, none I actually wanted to survive the trip. I still cant believe its been 20 years. Two decades since I finally won. All the capes were dead, and I was the absolute lord and master of the entire Earth. The hardest part of winning had been realizing that I finally had to put up or shut up. How many times had I told that insipid Captain Supreme that I could change the world if only he'd let me? And now I had. The first thing I did was cure cancer. My gift to the world to atone for taking their hero's. After that it was heart disease. A nanite in the form of a pill that scrubbed the arteries clean and extended the human life span by at least 30 years. There was nothing I couldnt fix. No one I couldnt save. And all they had to do was bow down before me... which they did. It was childs play. Everything was childs play. Everything was....boring. There were no challenges anymore. I had killed them all. \n \n It was time to make my appearance. I lifted the gaudy tinfoil lined helmet to my head and attached my velvet cape. Christ... velvet and tinfoil. I really was an idiot. Still, its hard to change your look when you're on every piece of money in the world. The news crews had landed... only one hadnt made it past the lasers, and it was from FOX so no big loss there. As I made my way down to the landing platform, a familiar face caught my eye. Her. Of course she was here. She was the only thing the idiot and I had in common... she was the only thing in the world I still felt anything for. And she hated me. Ever since I killed her hero. That redheaded idiot of a cameraman was with her... the one who had been his sidekick a lifetime ago. I remember he had actually cried on TV the day I won... that had been pretty funny. He was older now... the years had not been kind. He looked like life had kicked the shit out of him....but she was still beautiful. Looking at her, I felt the way I did back in school. Nervous... shy....too scared to even make eye contact. For gods sake man, get it together! You're the absolute ruler of the world... you can damn well make conversation with a nosy reporter and her idiot cameraman. Besides, maybe if I was nasty enough, I could make the ginger cry again. That was something to look forward to. With my hands on my hips and a sneer on my face, I got ready to give them a monologue for the ages... and then the gingers camera exploded. \n \n....The hell??? My ears were ringing and I was flat on my back. I tasted copper and my chest hurt like hell. Whatever they had hit me with had made it past the body armor. Fuck... thats a lot of blood. Off in the distance, I hear more choppers....sounds like military. So this is how it ends? I give them the world they always wanted, make everything perfect, and this is the thanks I get? Fucking normals....I should have just let the Justice Battalion send me to the penal colony on Mars all those years ago. I could have taken that place over in no time. But she was here. So I stayed. I always thought I could make her love me, if she would only give me half a chance. If only HE wasnt in the way. Everything I had done, I had done for her. Didnt she realize? And now here she was... finally... looking down at me. God, the look on her face....how can she hate me that much? She says something, but I cant hear over the buzzing in my ears....the last thing I see before my heart breaks for good is her spitting in my face. Fine. Let them eat cake. As soon as my heart stops, the self-destruct sequences will activate. The volcano will be the first thing to go. Then the EMP's in orbit. Then the moon. If I had to go, I was damn sure going to take every single one of them with me. Maybe in the next life, she would see the light. Maybe then I could make her love me.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You 're a Xenobiologist that has been tasked with tracking and recording the impact of invasive alien species has on Earth habitats .\n","story":"Department of the Interior, \n Agricultural Research Division, \n Office of Interpretation \n 03MAY2016 \n ALCON: \n This department-wide memorandum has been drafted in order to more readily prepare all divisions for newly scheduled operations directly related to selocrite. The following information is based on today's initial observations made by our team in Olympic National Park. \n \n Selocrite is a pale, nearly translucent xenotropic material most comparable to white moss. It was first observed on the coast of Washington on 02MAY2016. At this time, we believe selocrite arrived on Earth in the winter of 2015. It was most likely brought via meteor, though we are not sure how it would have been able to survive the temperatures of atmospheric entry. We believe it landed in the northern Pacific Ocean, and floated on the surface until it drifted into the northern west coast of the United States and some parts of southern Canada. Selocrite uses some biological processes found in algae and yeast, failing to indicate to us if this material is either plant or animal. Based on our findings, selocrite probably photosynthesizes oxygen and carbondioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into nitrogen and alcohol. This has had devastating effects on all ecosystems contaminated by selocrite, as it has so far dominated 100 % of plant species it encountered. In the first stages of invasion, selocrite uses a pale-white tendril system to move itself across surfaces while long follicles on top absorb sunlight, oxygen and carbon monoxide from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrogen and alcohol, most of which is released back into the environment around it. In the Pacific Ocean, the released nitrogen has caused unstable eutrophycation; the over-enrichment of algae has caused algae blooms the size of Texas, thus shading huge expanses of ocean, blocking out all sunlight, denying aquatic ecosystem the ability to photosynthesize and produce oxygen, thus suffocating nearly all life above a depth of 700 miles. Dead zones have bloomed into one, and the dead zone now spans from the estimated point of arrival in the Pacific to where it reached land in Neah Bay. \n \n Upon entry to Neah Bay, selocrite overtook coastal rock and gravel and spread inward from the coast, drawing nutrients out of grass and small shrubs. It is unclear whether or not selocrite also drew nutrients out of the insects and small animals that may have been smothered by its tendrils, which spread over land at a pace of about 2 inches per second and over water at about 1 inch per second. As of this evening, selocrite has completely dominated all earthy terrain from its entry point in Neah to it's current location in Olympic, and it is currently spreading east. While early morning observations had recorded selocrite not holding on to inorganic structures, the tendrils later changed color from pale white to a deep red and latched on to the inorganic surfaces. Inorganic surfaces could be seen silhouetted in deep red among the expanse of milky white. One hour prior to the submission of this memorandum, the entire mass of selocrite began turning from white to red. We are not sure what this means. \n \n We have opened collaborative efforts with the Department of Defense and will be expediting all operations directly related to selocrite and implementing several new operations this month. Please check your email frequently and answer all incoming calls. You may be requested to work after 6pm. \n \n -V\/R \n Beatsworkin \n Chief of Xenobiology, Office of Interpretation \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Then, they accelerated\u2026 fifteen, ten, five, then just two paces away. \n \n He ducked, his core folding in, right leg already outstretched and braced for impact. Bruce felt the sweeping attack pass harmlessly over his back, but chills raced across the nape of his neck. The whipping crack of the air, as it made way for the precision strike, made it clear that he had only barely dodged the assault. \n \n Bruce built on his momentum and rolled forward, pushing with his palms against the ground to spin around to face his attacker. His fists were already clenched, ready to visit merciless revenge. \n \n He expected one of the enforcers from the gangs, sent to remind him not to stand up to them in public. Or perhaps a pugilist, hired by one of the rival schools to throw a wrench in his expanding fame. \n \n He did not expect a girl, barely twenty, back ramrod straight, casting a sideways glance at him. Her poise was equal to none. \n \n Bruce \u2019 s mind raced as he too straightened to meet this threat. His breaths, coming in short measured pulses, helped him focus and watch for micro-movements in his opponent, which he had long learned could easily betray hidden lines of attack. \n \n Even then, Bruce only narrowly sidestepped the frontal assault. As if she was leaping off a springboard, the girl pounced, feet a blur as her staccato steps delivered her to Bruce like an enraged python. Three strikes from her took a full eight deflections from him, as Bruce fought to maintain ground. \n \n Then, a misstep. An old ankle injury threw him off balance for a split second, which was a world of opportunity for the girl. Emitting a short, sharp battlecry, her feet found purchase behind his, and she tapped him on the chest, sending him crashing to the ground. \n \n Instinct, his old friend, forced him to tuck his head to the side, and not a moment too soon. His enemy, having misjudged Bruce \u2019 s recovery position, planted a fist into the wall next to his head, sending chips of concrete sailing through the air. \n \n A lesser fighter would have seized the opening and sought to snap her arm at the joints where it was weakest. But Bruce was a top-notch martial artist, at the zenith of his skill, and he knew when he had to retreat. He pushed away, rolling like a loosened yo-yo. His breaths, ragged and deep, burned his lungs. \n \n \u201c Very good. You are certainly what we need. Get ready to depart, we have to leave soon. \u201d \n \n \u201c Leave? Are you crazy? You just tried to kill me! \u201d \n \n \u201c There is no time. I \u2019 ve got another 4 positions to fill, and we need to leave before my portal closes. It \u2019 s a lot harder finding you people than you would think. \u201d \n \n Bruce shook his head glumly. \u201c I don \u2019 t know which school you trained at. You \u2019 re good, but your head\u2026 you \u2019 ve probably hit it too many times. \u201d \n \n \u201c Bruce, let me put it this way, \u201d she said, dusting off the front of her jacket. \u201c In the near future, silicone-based lifeforms will metastasize into our immediate solar system, and they will demand trial by combat in the form of a brutal and bloody melee disguised as a sport. Defeat will indicate that we are ripe for the picking, and we will lose our stake on this world. \u201d \n \n \u201c Yes, \u201d Bruce said, \u201c definitely trained too hard. \u201d \n \n The girl sighed. \u201c I \u2019 ll rephrase. Aliens will come to earth. If we don \u2019 t beat them at their version of football, they will destroy the earth. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh. Why didn \u2019 t you say that, then. So what does this have to do with me? \u201d \n \n \u201c Humanity needs a team of 20 players. It \u2019 s clear that we would never find 20 talented people in a single time-era, so I \u2019 ve been sent to recruit the best of the best across time. You \u2019 re going to be our goalkeeper, there \u2019 s no one else better suited. \u201d \n \n \u201c What? I can \u2019 t go! I \u2019 ve got a family here! \u201d \n \n \u201c And they will all die if you don \u2019 t step up now. It is your choice. I can not force you. \u201d \n \n Bruce \u2019 s shoulders sagged. If he were years younger, he would have resisted, and wasted precious minutes arguing. But if there was one thing life taught him, it was when to recognize duty calling. \n \n \u201c Listen, Bruce. If you come with me, we \u2019 ll make it look like you died here. Only your family will know the truth.

I knew at the first sign of the micro-expression of confusion my whole family was fucked. \n \n `` Her name is....'' Pause. \n `` Her name is'Bites People'.'' At this I had to laugh, of all of the things that could have been picked to describe what my people do..... \n \n But the mirth of course did not last long, since they knew immediately who I was, who ( and what ) we were. So here I am now, on the lam, single, with an infant that is carrying the most ridiculous name I've ever heard. \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] `` Let him without sin cast the first stone . '' As the rest of the crown dwindles , you stoop down to pick up a rock .\n","story":"Timothy felt like he was the creative sort. He had several ideas, some he meant to log and forgot. While in that circle surrounding Jesus, who said to the people `` Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,'' Timothy could n't help but pick up the rock at his feet. An idea came to him, one he knew was wholly original, and would begin to log almost immediately upon that encounter with Jesus. \n This stone would be the star of his new play. \n Timothy came before Jesus, thanked him for the offer, and kissed his feet. Timothy then hurried home and began scribbling on parchment paper, starting first with a title: `` Glass Houses Throwing Stones.'' Timothy did not know what these words meant, for he had only really heard them in conversation, but he questioned not his creativity and continued writing. \n Hours passed, and midday turned to dusk which turned to night. By candlelight Timothy has finished his opus, shouting praise of all sorts for his achievement. He had successfully been the first to cast a stone as a lead in a play. \n When the dawn broke, Timothy rose with excitement. He headed to the town center to share his piece, his masterstroke. As he went to pin his script on the message board, he perused other topics of the day curious what word spread around town. He stopped at particularly interesting headline, `` Rocks in a Hard Place.'' To Timothy's shock, it was a script starring a lead rock! Already pinned to the board! Timothy shook with rage and envy, and saw another piece -- `` Rolling Stones'' -- and then another, and another! The board was filled with plays and stories casting a stone as the lead! \n What arrogance these people have, Timothy thought to himself, and he threw his manuscript on the ground, leaving it there to be trampled upon and gather dust. To think, these people see themselves without sin and cast stones in their pieces. And that is when Timothy realized the importance of the message. He knew then he was not without sin, so he should not cast stones. He hurried back home and began writing, this time casting other minerals as leads instead. Jesus wept.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Multiple nuclear explosions wipe out several cities in the middle east , but noone knows who deployed the weapons . This is the resulting UN emergency meeting .\n","story":"Two pairs of feet clamored down the ivory colored hallway and shoved past the towering dark wooden doors into the intense atmosphere of the round room. The United States delegate and her aid had arrived. \n \n `` Sorry I'm late, The cabinet nearly shit itself trying to deal with the press.'' \n Everyone nodded in silent understanding. The meeting had now officially begun. The presiding president of the UN began with a report of why everyone was called. \n \n `` For the official record I will now go over why this meeting was called. In the past 48 hours, fifteen nuclear bombs went off in the Middle Eastern region of the world. No official word has been confirmed on who had set off the bombs. The UN asks all nations who have any knowledge to speak up.'' \n The room was dead. Suspicious eyes scanned every delegate. Nothing. Even a cellphone going off would be welcomed at this point. The UN president sighed and slumped in his chair. \n \n `` Fine. If no country is willing to speak up then I move to condemn all countries.'' \n There was a low murmur. \n `` It has been too long now that this Union has hidden behind the claim of peace if no country is willing to step toward it!'' \n Meanwhile sprinting down the hallway was an intern of the UN staff. He burst through the doors and yelled, `` I know who did it!'' \n Everyone turned to the panting kid. The UN president rushed over to him and tried to calm him down. \n `` Speak slowly and clearly; who did this?'' \n \n `` I'll show you.'' The kid took the laptop he was gripping onto and placed it onto China's table and opened it. He linked it to the projector and a picture was illuminated in the back wall. The US delegate stood up while Russia's delegate looked horrified. \n It was none other than Edward Snowden. A man who claimed he looked out for civilians killed millions just mere minutes. \n `` How...'' The US delegate asked and looked towards the Russian delegate. He stood up shaking his chair as he did so. But the intern interjected. \n \n `` He stole codes from multiple nations.'' \n \n `` How do you know this?'' The Japanese delegate demanded. \n \n `` He sent a fucking memo to the UN thirty minutes ago. I noticed a new email from our servers and of course thought it could be important. When I saw it was a memo I wondered who could be so stupid as too send something so trivial that I thought it was a joke. I looked at it anyway. This is what it said.'' The intern pulled up the email. \n \n `` Dear nations, \n I am disappointed in all of you and even in the nations that are n't there with you. I can safely assume you are all shocked. This was my plan all along. The chaos I created with the NSA scandal was a diversion for the codes I stole. Escaping to Russia was just another step in getting the other codes. Clearly you must all be asking why instead of how now, right? Well, to save time I'll tell you: The world has forced this to happen. No country could see past it's own interests. You have all refused to step up to the world plate! Now, innocent lives have paid the price. It now depends on the coalition of the UN to do what is right..that is if you can figure that out in time.'' \n It was as the room read the last line that fear set in. It was the following lines that panic set in. \n \n `` That's right UN. I have all the codes to your nuclear weapons. Either you all must try for peace, real peace, or I send a major city and then some to hell. You have the next 48 hours to come up with something or New York City might be next. Oh, and do n't even think about saying anything to the outside world. Or you all die. Good luck, you'll need it.'' \n \n The UN president slammed the computer shut. \n `` It's time then; we must prove that humanity will triumph.'' \n The stage was set as Snowden sat back in his chair as observed his screen. He smirked at the UN presidents words. Only the brink of destruction can make the world go round, Edward thought.\n"}

I can \u2019 t believe it has been fourteen years, that \u2019 s crazy! Anyway tonight I \u2019 m going out with friends. There is this new bar called Feugo \u2019 s that has opened up and now that I can legally dink I thought I might try it! Like I said last time, this has been a long time coming! I might even try it with Ariana tonight. Jack is coming to, he said that we could `` wingman'' each other, he has some proper sick ideas for drinking games before hand to. Going to be one hell of a wild night! I would write for longer but got to get ready for tonight man! Am I looking forward this! Peace Out x \n \n \n \n 16\/09\/2038 \n \n So I just found this old diary of mine. Ten years since my last post, you can tell to as there ain \u2019 t much left of it! Just read through the last post left in the thing and it is not pretty! Although to be fair I do still rember that night and it was indeed wild, I did get with Ariana in the end! \n \n \n So what has changed in ten years? Well certainly not the infant mortality rate, which is the same and has been for 24 years now! I know, not funny. Seriously not much has changed, well nothing to big anyway. I guess the university thing is big. The only surviving school or university in the whole world is Oxford now. No new people for uni for six years, so tehy they where all just haemorrhaging money. I mean that is pretty big! Oh actually there is one thing, there is a twenty year old called Alison Brandi and she has just signed a contract worth almost 1 billion dollars over ten years. She works in the adult industry and obviously they are craving for the youngsters. I know sex sells but 1 Billion is absolutely bonkers, it is the premium you pay for the youngest person on earth. Still, it is quite the investment. \n \n \n It is quite odd actually I am only 24 and yet I \u2019 m seen as old. Jack reckons we are going to be screwed by the time we grow we old. Who is going to pay our pension, who is going to care for us? I told him he was exaggerating they \u2019 ll develop a proper test tube baby soon, he does n't agree. One minute he is having a laugh and the next he gets all serious! I mean I love the man but he can be a bit of a downer sometimes he is not as bad as the rest of them though. Everyone always seems so bleak! They are always moaning about everything, they all walk round expressionless! At least the government know what they are doing, investing in the future; they are talking about selling off some services to set up funding for research into why the infertility thing happened. It will help us get to the bottom of the problem and solve it. Anyway I better be off man, see you soon. Peace Out. \n \n \n \n 02\/5\/2043 \n \n I dug this out thinking I could read about Jack but it hasn \u2019 t helped. As I write this, I write with a heavy heart and lump in my throat. Today Jack officially passed on. I don \u2019 t know what to do with myself. I \u2019 ve been trying to keep myself occupied but I just can \u2019 t do it. Even something simple like the news won \u2019 t help. It is just all stories about the collapse in Sierra Leone. I forget momentarily but then it all comes flooding back. The pictures of the government don \u2019 t help either. I \u2019 m just heartbroken. He was my best friend and now there is nothing, he just doesn \u2019 t exist! How can a man go from being there to just not? I can \u2019 t take it. \n \n It is the governments fault. They are running out of money because there are less workers to earn them money and more pensioners to pay. They sold pretty much everything, including the health service. The owners are just trying to make as much money as they can now, when you couple that with the fact that the population is constantly decreasing, it means that the human body has now become a finite and valuable resource. In fact it has now become a commodity. Jack was blood type AB which was already rare he needed a transfusion because his kidney was n't working, something like that, but by now it has become far too expensive. Only the rich can afford it and the poor take the brunt. This country is going to the dogs. The world is going to the dogs. \n \n \n Even last week Sierra Leone officially ceased to exist as a country. The men and women who farm there have relied on their children and young men for generations but obviously that has become a problem. No one could do the work efficiently meaning families could n't feed which made an already low life expectancy almost non-existent. Everything is just starting to tip. I had n't really thought about how bad it was, I just kept living like most do. Jacks death has opened my eyes though. Now that his constant pessimism is gone I realise that he was right all along. \n \n \n \n 27\/04\/2059 \n \n It is almost done now. The government has fallen completely; they've sold everything, what is left to do? They still exist but they do nothing, nothing. Men in suits control everything, the government could n't afford to pay me or give me a pension whereas the fat cat business man could. Naturally I flew to the fat cat. It is so hard to get job though, the fall of most of Europe, Asia and Africa has resulted in mass immigration. Those people are willing to work for next to nothing so we have to as well if we want a job and I need one. There is almost nothing left. The government has no power; the people are under the control of business. Nothing can be done. I \u2019 m starting to think that maybe I should have listened more to Jack all those years ago, we could have got out early. Each year the retirement age is pushed further and further back and each year I regret what will come with the next. \n \n \n \n 12\/03\/2066 \n \n I am now 56 years of age. I have out lived most everyone and thing I have ever known. I don \u2019 t know who will read this. Maybe evolution will create a new breed of sentient beings but more likely not. This journal will become like my life, pointless and aimless. Nothing happens anymore. All structures have collapsed, not a single large business or government remain anywhere in the world. There is simply nothingness. I \u2019 m sitting on a boat sailing across the pacific while writing this. I just needed to get out of England, out of Europe and ideally I just want out. I \u2019 m hoping the boat will crash and we will drown. I have no skills anymore, no one does. The youngest man on this planet is 52, within a few years even they will become incapable then soon after they will die. I am by no means old but I feel as though I have had enough. I gave the last of the caps I owned to a sailor about to head off and here I am. He is sitting in his cabin and I \u2019 m out here on the deck. I \u2019 ve tried three times already to just be done with it and jump but every time I do, I can \u2019 t. \n \n \n These last few years have pushed me over the edge, derelict streets and buildings everywhere. Rarely a person in sight, only few remained and soon it would be none. The entire population would be gone, a world savaged by violence, greed and destruction. These streets where excessive and big because of mans greed, they were busy and lively because of mans greed and now they lie barren because of mans greed. I am and have been used to loneliness for a while now but not emptiness, emptiness is different. I don \u2019 t know if it was God who took away the children or if it was science. There is one thing I am sure of though, we brought this upon ourselves. Our people fought each other for scraps, they fought each other for entitlement and greed and in the end they fought each other because they knew nothing else. Greed was what made man great and greed is what made man fall. \n\n"}

It was creased and weathered, and looked like it had seen many other hands upon it before it had come to rest in mine. Stamped across the front of it was **EIB Top Secret**. It was thick, filled with dog-eared pages of written notes and a natural weight that spoke to the interest of the person detailed within to the department. I turned it carefully over in my hands, not quite sure what to make of it. I sat forward in my chair and checked the name on the label at the file's edge. *Torrance B. Williams*. It did n't sound like the kind of name that would have this size of a file. \n \n Across the desk from me, sat the Director. He was leaning back in his chair, a cigar between his fingers and a particularly intense stare directed towards me. I could feel it, even though I was purposefully staring at the manila folder. After a moment, I raised my eyes to meet his stare. A flicker of a smile passed his lips and was gone in an instant as he raised his cigar and drew deeply from it, exhaling a cloud of sweet, blue-grey smoke into the cramped office. \n \n `` Welcome to the Bureau, Special Agent Meph. Your first assignment is in that folder.'' Was all Director Crowley said to me, gesturing towards the folder I was holding with his cigar. \n \n `` Sir?'' I replied, feeling slightly puzzled. There was *no way in hell* that this was meant to be my first assignment. Crowley nodded, raising the cigar to his lips again and stretching his other arm out before resting it behind his head. \n \n `` You're not feeling up to the task?'' He asked. \n \n `` Sir, that's not the case. This is simply... Unexpected.'' I replied carefully. *Way, way more than anyone could have expected* - the thought accompanied me silently. \n \n Crowley sat upright in his chair before leaning forward and fixing me with that stare again. I wanted to look away from its intensity. I could feel it looking further into me than any thing had the right to. \n \n `` Do you want to know why you've been given this assignment?'' Crowley asked after a moment, taking the cigar from his lips and further filling the room with smoke as the words struck me like punches. \n \n I could only nod. *hold the stare, hold the stare, hold the stare* my mind shrieked at me. \n \n `` The human whose dossier you're holding in your hands is somehow responsible for the complete disappearance of no less than five Ethereal citizens. I've managed to pull a few strings at the Guidance Bureau and you've been assigned as his sixth. I need you to find out *how* a mortal is causing the disappearance, and *put a stop to it. *'' The last words Crowley spoke had an unmistakable weight to them. \n \n I shuddered slightly and broke eye contact. Crowley sat back in his chair again, his face now unreadable. \n \n `` What's the split, Sir?'' I asked. Crowley nodded. \n \n `` Two Celestial, three Infernal. You'll find all this and more in the brief. Read up on it before you leave here. The file stays here. When you leave, head over to the Guidance Bureau and ask to see Azreal. He's expecting you.'' \n \n `` Yes Sir.'' I replied before standing and clutching the dossier tightly in my hands. \n \n `` Meph,'' Crowley said as I turned to leave his office. `` I heard good things about you during your training. Someone Downstairs requested you get this one. It's possible that there's an *artifact* in play here. Bear that in mind during your investigation.'' \n \n `` Of course Sir. I wo n't let you down.'' I replied, hand frozen as it was stretched out towards the door handle. \n \n `` Very Good. Dismissed, then.'' Crowley said, turning his attention to the next file on his desk. \n \n I made my way back through the dimly lit corridors, past office windows with their blinds dropped. Agents, both Infernal and Celestial walked silently through the halls, some with dossiers, others with empty coffee cups. I arrived back at my desk and sat down in my chair. The manila folder slapped heavily down on the desk in front of me. \n \n I was n't sure whether to feel excited or terrified. Undercover investigations and an implication of wetwork on day one at the Ethereal Investigations Bureau, straight from the Director himself. \n \n I cracked open the case file and started looking through the life and times of one *Torrance B.

{"prompt":"[ RF ] A person living far , far away from home receives a package from his\/her family .\n","story":"As the sun rose over the horizon, the coldness of the desert night quickly evaporated into a dry heat, permeating even the shade that was supposed to provide such respite from the mid-day sun's relentless beating. Dan shifted uncomfortably in his seat, as week-old sweat continued to build up under his flak jacket. If his equipment, having suffered from a week of daily assault by the sun, could be juiced, he was sure it would probably form it's own sort of super-mutated organism capable of rivaling most comic-book villains in sheer reprehensibility. His seat in the back of the Humvee probably already contained bits of this organism squirming around, hiding under him out of fear of what the six soldiers in the truck would do to it if it revealed it's existence. And with the truck zooming down the desert highway at almost sixty miles per hour, there was no way it was going to make an escape anytime soon. \n \n `` Glickstein!'' A voice shouted from above Dan. Dan looked up through the turret hole in the middle of the truck at the origin of the voice to see his gunner looking down at him from his post on the M2HB machine gun mounted atop the Humvee. \n \n `` My'back's empty. Do we have anymore bottles back there?'' the voice asked once it noticed Dan looking up at him. \n \n `` I think, lem me check,'' Dan responded, turning back to the bed of the truck. Lying across the bed was a stretcher with another soldier, fatigues spotted with blood across the lower abdomen, holding onto the sides of the stretcher with his only equipment being the IV hanging on the roll bar above him leading down to his arm. As Dan reached over the wounded soldier and dug through a box, he put a light hand on the soldier's shoulder. \n \n `` How're you hangin' in there, Rocco?'' Dan asked the wounded man as he pulled a bottle of water out of the box. \n \n `` Morphine's starting to wear off, but at least I'm getting used to the pain. So long as we do n't go offroading again,'' the soldier nicknamed Rocco responded weakly, reaching up with a free hand to pat the hand that Dan had put on his shoulder. \n \n `` We're almost back at Camp Delta, man, they'll get you some of the good shit there,'' Dan said, turning back to his seat. \n \n `` You better not let them give me any of that weak K shit man,'' Rocco joked, chuckling for a second before grabbing his wound in pain as he realized how much laughing was going to hurt him. \n \n `` Mace!'' Dan called up to his gunner, reaching his hand with the bottle of water up through the turret hole. \n \n `` Thanks man!'' the gunner responded taking it from him before leaning back. \n \n Dan pulled his hand back into the truck and leaned towards the front of the truck to address the driver. \n \n `` Hey Liao, how far out are we?'' Dan asked. \n \n `` 3 minutes,'' the driver said, suddenly slowing down and pointing down a dirt road intersecting the highway, `` Camp's at the end of this road. Better hold on to our boy back there.'' \n \n Dan sat back and reached a hand back to tap the shoulder of the wounded soldier behind him. \n \n `` I heard him man. I ca n't believe we still have n't paved over this shit,'' Rocco said, grabbing Dan's hand. \n \n As the Humvee pulled up to the gates of the Camp, the barriers blocking the road swung up as if to leap out of the way of the truck, and men standing in the gate started beckoning to the truck to move towards the giant corrugated metal building with a large red cross painted onto it's side. \n \n Sliding to a halt in the dirt in front of the building, Dan and the rest of the men piled out of the truck, all moving to the rear bed and helping to open the hatch and pull the stretcher out. Dan reached in to grab the IV, and as he turned he was greeted by the sight of many men in scrubs pouring out of the entrance of the building, rushing to greet the truck. \n \n As they passed off the stretcher and IV to the medical staff, each of the men from the truck patted Rocco on his shoulder before returning to unloading equipment from the truck, and the medical staff hurried back in with him as soon as the men were out of the way. \n \n Dan pulled his rucksack out of the back of the truck, waved at the driver as he jumped back in to bring the truck to the motor pool, and walked towards the sea of tents with his gunner, equipment in hand. \n \n `` Did you see Charlie Company lined up at the motor pool on the way in?'' the gunner asked, as they plodded along. \n \n `` Nah,'' Dan responded, `` anything out of the ordinary?'' \n \n `` Just a couple of chucklefucks mounting a TOW missile on top of the lead Humvee. As if that'd do them any good,'' the gunner said. \n \n `` I'd watch how loudly you say that, Corporal Mason,'' a voice behind them called. \n \n The two men spun around to the source of the voice. A tall, balding man stood before them, holding a clipboard and not really paying attention to the two of them as he flipped through pages on it. The two men dropped their equipment and saluted him with crisp motions, and he merely lifted a hand in a saluting gesture, his hand coming up just above the eagle on his collar before waving it at them. \n \n `` At ease, gentlemen. The two of you did good work out at the OP this past week, you'd better enjoy having the racks to yourself tonight before the rest of Bravo company returns in the morning,'' the colonel said, still not looking up from his papers. \n \n `` Thank you, Colonel Vickery,'' the two men said in unison. \n \n `` Corporal Alex Mason, do n't let me catch you jawjackin other companies again,'' the colonel exasperated, finally looking up from his clipboard. \n \n `` Yes, sir!,'' Alex responded stiffly. \n \n `` Dismissed,'' Colonel Vickery said nonchalantly, looking back down at his clipboard and moving on. \n \n The two men picked up their equipment and sauntered back to their barracks quietly, hoping to avoid any more attention before they had a chance to relax. \n \n Entering the tent that they called their barracks, the two men made beelines for their cots and immediately sat down their equipment at their footlockers at the foot of the cots. Sitting on top of Dan's footlocker was a brown box, obviously dropped off during the weekly mail runs that they had missed that week. \n \n `` Is that the turret shield you ordered?'' Alex asked, sitting on his own footlocker and shuffling through his mail. \n \n `` Ca n't be, it's too light,'' Dan said, picking it up and reading the label on the top, `` Says it's from your girlfriend though.'' \n \n Alex dropped his mail and scurried over to Dan. \n \n `` What the hell, why is she sending you care packages and not me?'' Alex asked, grabbing the box out of Dan's hands. \n \n `` I do n't know man, but there was a card with it,'' Dan said, picking up the card sitting on top of the pile of letters that had been next to the box. \n \n `` Whatever dude, I swear to god if she's sending you more shit than I get I'm gon na kill her,'' Alex said, tearing apart the box. \n \n Dan flipped open the card and started reading it, only to hear a pop ring out next to him and see a giant flash of light in the corner of his eye. \n \n `` What the fuck?'' Dan said, looking up, finding his gunner covered in glitter. \n \n Alex put the box down slowly and started laughing. \n \n `` Damn, I shoulda let you open it! She put a damn camera in here!'' He said, reaching into the box and pulling out the Polaroid camera that was printing out a picture of him reacting to the glitter bomb. \n \n Dan looked back down at the card and finished reading it. \n \n `` Says here that we should send the photo back to her so she can find out who was stupid enough to open it without reading the card for safe handling instructions. Also there's a chocolate unicorn under the glitter bomb. And something else for you in the bottom?'' \n \n Alex picked the box back up and started digging through it. He pulled out a plastic box that had melted chocolate dripping out of the sides, and laughed as he chucked it aside, and reached back into the box to grab his own gift. \n \n Dan put down the card and picked up the plastic box that once housed a chocolate unicorn and took the lid off to start drinking what was left of the chocolate and looked over at Alex as he pulled out a smaller box. \n \n `` Wha ee iiii?'' Dan asked, chugging the chocolate out of the box. \n \n `` Dunno. It's heavy,'' Alex said, pulling the brown packaging off of it to reveal a metal block. \n \n `` Looks cool,'' Dan said, putting down the now empty container of chocolate, `` How do you open it?'' \n \n Alex tugged on one side of the block, revealing a compartment that pulled out, and the two watched as a revolver tumbled to the ground with a post-it note stuck on it. Alex reached down and picked it up. \n \n `` Hope this'll come in handy winky face?'' Alex read, `` Holy shit she got me a fuckin forty-four magnum, dude!'' \n \n `` Damn. I'm glad we opened this before the rest of the guys got here otherwise you'd never hear the end of it,'' Dan said, licking the container of chocolate clean, `` Thank Tiff for the chocolate by the way that shit is awesome.''\n"}

Then he started laughing, laughing like a maniac. \n Harden could have attacked him, but it felt wrong. \n \n `` Aid... Aid! Harden, open your eyes. I respect your military skills, dude. But the Loyalist forces are not here to help you. They are eradicating everyone who does not comply with them. You are the leader of the rebel forces. A mere whisper of a rumor, and they lay total siege to your supposed locations.'' \n \n `` Mere lies, Vivius.'' Harden launched a grenade and blew up a passing Dark scoutship. The villain watched in amusement as the ship broke up and fell into the depths of the gas planet. \n \n `` Believe as you wish. I respect your cause, but you have the wrong allies.'' \n \n `` I should listen no further to a Dark lord.'' He powered up his weapons. \n \n `` As we speak now, my main fleet has annihilated the lead elements of the elite Royal 6th fleet and can flee before the main body arrives.'' Vivius pleaded. `` My rearguard is fighting this pointless skirmish with your squadrons. I ask of you one more time: evacuate before they capture you. The empire is rotten to the core and aims to eradicate all races. I seek to destroy it and let chaos reign supreme. You seek justice for the empire, but you will find none. We will face each other one day, but not today. Today, you must flee.'' \n \n Hardens answer came in the form of a grenade. The Dark lord force-grabbed one of the scoutships that flew by and made it catch the grenade. The two looked at each other. They understood. \n \n `` Hmmm. I see. Interesting choice.'' He fired his autocannon. Harden ducked, but it was not aimed at him. Vivius was flunged into the air, away from the platform destabilisator shields, and suddenly disappeared in the sky. A mothership had beamed him away. \n \n `` Coward!'' Harden yelled, but he did not mean it. \n \n -- - \n \n On the imperial flagship *Imdem*, Harden was about to greet the emperor. But the moment he beamed onto the platform, his guard was gunned down by soldiers. \n \n The emperor approached him. `` You amuse me, Harden. You have not fled. Did you truly believe we were going to help you? Nanobots have recorded your meeting with the Dark lord.'' \n \n Harden tried to smile, which was quite hard to do as he groaned from his injuries. `` I do believe the empire is pompous enough to park the entirety of its fleet in a defenceless mode in an official ceremony.'' \n \n The emperor frowned. In the distance, the sky suddenly lit up. \n A Dark fleet appeared and opened fire. \n \n `` You will weather this storm alone.'' The rebel leader said before he teleported away.\n"}

Just about to get to the good part, too. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh? \u201d \n \n Lucky for me, she was in the top bunk and could n't see me blush. \u201c Never mind that. I'm pissed it crashed and woke me up, but I guess I'm glad too. You hear awful stories about what happens when someone gets a bad program and it wo n't abort. \u201d \n \n \u201c Like that guy over in the Neuroprogramming department a few days ago, what was his name.

What, do you know him? \u201d \n \n I rubbed the top of my head gingerly. \u201c He was my lab partner last year in Structural Aesthetics. Sweet guy, and *way* smarter than I am. I might not have passed without his help. \u201d \n \n \u201c Oh, hell, Luann, I'm sorry. Listen, maybe I got the name wrong, maybe it's somebody else. Or some other Jason, it's a pretty common name. \u201d \n \n \u201c I hope so, \u201d I said, keeping my doubts to myself. Erica was n't wrong, exactly, but I could feel the dread building in my stomach, swamping me with a wave of nausea. I remembered Jason saying he'd planned on declaring Neuroprogramming his major. I knew it was him. \n \n I closed my eyes, and for a moment, I pictured the last moments of my aborted dream sequence. It had probably failed because I'd altered the program, one of a cheap dream pack I'd picked up for a few credits, just to play with. Most of my money went for tuition, so I could n't afford the good stuff, and I'd spent a few hours tweaking the code to make the generic man in the dream into someone I knew. \n \n Into Jason, actually. I had n't been brave enough by the end of last year to tell him how I felt, and I barely saw him anymore\u2014we did n't have any classes together this semester. \n \n Suddenly, the thought of him with mush for brains after a programming accident was just too much. I got out of bed and started pulling on some clothes. \n \n Erica leaned over the edge of her bunk, her head a dark spot haloed by the light from her reading lamp. \u201c What are you doing? \u201d \n \n \u201c I do n't feel so good, \u201d I answered, fighting a wave of dizziness as I struggled into my jeans. \u201c I think I should go down to the clinic and get checked out. \u201d \n \n \u201c Luann. \u201d \n \n I turned to her, but I could n't read her expression, back-lit as she was. \u201c It's not him, \u201d she said. \u201c Even if it is, running across campus in the middle of the night to find out wo n't change that. \u201d \n \n \u201c I have to go, Erica. I really liked him. \u201d I paused. \u201c And I think my dream crashed because I tweaked it. I really should get checked out, or I might start speaking in tongues tomorrow, or something random like that. \u201d \n \n She sighed, then nodded. \u201c Okay, then. \u201d \n \n Outside, the cold night air hit me like a brick, and I fought another spell of dizziness. Had I really scrambled something in my brain? The professors always warned us not to play with our own programs, but at one point or another nearly everyone I know had tried it. Once you knew how, it was almost an impossible temptation to resist, like standing near a bonfire and *not* holding out your hands to it. \n \n I shook my head to clear it and set out for the clinic. At first I was walking, but after a few moments I was jogging, and before I was halfway there I was practically sprinting. \n \n I imagined finding Jason there, lying catatonic in some curtained alcove, hidden away from the everyday bustle of the students getting their routine checkups. I was afraid of that almost as much as I dreaded being plugged into the diagnostics myself and finding out I'd erased a chunk of my memory banks, or changed my default download language to Portuguese, or something worse. \n \n I did n't *feel* different. Not yet, anyway. But my heart was shivering like a struck cymbal, and my lungs ached like fire as I ran. \n \n -152\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Working security for a high profile client , you notice an out of place looking bald janitor with a bar code on the back of his head . Moments later , you see the same man dressed as one of your own . Nobody else seems to be seeing this . The man is now obviously following you to the restroom .\n","story":"I pushed open the door to the restroom and walked inside. The bald man followed a second later. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye. His face was a blank, emotionless mask. Even his eyes seemed lifeless, staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living, breathing organism. \n \n I stepped up to a urinal, then paused. I glanced at the man again. He was still standing there, staring straight ahead. He seemed to be waiting. \n \n I reached down towards my zipper, then hesitated. I made a decision. Instead of taking a piss, I turned around and faced the man. \n \n Still he stood, like a statue, his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder. I looked him over from head to toe. He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event. I knew all the other guys, and he was not one of us. He was definitely dressed in a security uniform, though, which led me to a disquieting conclusion: he'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards. \n \n I pondered confronting him directly. If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard, then he was probably trying to do something covertly. He might reveal something, or even flee, if he knew his cover's blown. \n \n Then again, he might not. Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight. The security staff were issued with tasers, as well as a sidearm. The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape, so if he had a taser and a gun, then it would be too risky for me to fight him. \n \n I decided I needed backup. I would finish my business in the bathroom, then contact my supervisor. We'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together, before he tried anything. \n \n I turned back to the urinal. Before I could unzip, though, I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck. I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around. The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand. \n \n `` What the fuck? What did you just inject into me? What was that?'' I yelled at him. I felt faint, but did not lose consciousness. I could fight the drug off. Maybe it was because he was n't able to give me a full dose. \n \n I was surprised to hear a girl's voice reply. `` *What the... that's never happened before. The tranquilizer is supposed to knock him right out. *'' \n \n A male voice replied to her, `` *Yeah, and security guard NPCs are n't supposed to talk to you either. Is this from a recent patch or something? *'' The voices were n't coming from the bald man. They seemed to come from all around me, like ethereal beings speaking to me from another dimension. \n \n `` Patch? What are you talking about? Who's speaking?'' I demanded. My mind was growing gradually clearer. I definitely could fight the drug off. \n \n `` *What the* ***fuck??? ***'' The male voice practically screamed out. `` *The guard just fucking talked to me! He talked to me from the game! *'' \n \n The girl's voice, equally panicked, screeched, `` *Turn it off, fucking turn it off! This is fucked up, Todd, what the fuck? *'' \n \n Suddenly, everything around me, from the walls and urinals of the bathroom to the bald man himself, dissolved into electronic static. My surroundings were replaced by complete darkness. It was my turn to mutter in panic, `` What the fuck?'' \n \n Then, as abruptly as it had appeared, the darkness vanished, and in its place I found myself standing in a cubical structure, where one wall was entirely a gigantic transparent pane of glass. Through the glass I could see two people, two gigantic teenagers, towering over me as they stared at me in utter shock. The guy, dressed in baggy jeans and a t-shirt with a heavy metal emblem on the chest, still held a video game console controller in his hand. The girl, with both hands covering her mouth out of surprise, looked like she was about to jump out of her goth outfit in fear. \n \n I looked around. It appeared I was inside a gigantic television set of some sort. Through the glass I could see a couch, lamps, a rug: the furnishings of a living room, all of which was massive compared to my size. I looked down at myself. I was still dressed in my security uniform, and everything seemed normal. Apart from the fact that I was now apparently miniscule, and trapped inside a TV. \n \n I suppressed the panic that was gnawing at my gut. Panic later, I thought to myself. Right now, you need to figure out what happened, and how you're going to get back to your world. \n \n I rapped the glass with my knuckles. `` Excuse me? Could you get me out of here please?'' \n \n ***** \n \n Agent 47 slipped the now-empty syringe back into his pocket. The security guard was sprawled in front of the row of urinals, completely unconscious. Grabbing the guard by one ankle, 47 dragged the guard into a nearby stall, then locked him inside. The guard would wake up in a few hours, no worse for wear apart from a momentary headache, a very dry mouth, and no memory of what had happened. \n \n Agent 47 briefly wondered what the guard was seeing or hearing right now. The tranquilizing drug apparently created vivid dreams and hallucinations, which meant many victims woke up rather confused and disoriented. The thought was nothing more than a passing musing in 47's mind, though, as he turned his attention back to the assassination at hand. Two security guards down, four more to go.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] '' The thing about immortality is that even if it preserves your body , it does n't stop the wearing down of your soul ... ''\n","story":"\n Mortality and death are divine intervention. Written in the stars, engraved in destiny irreversibly. Your spirit is an energy propelling the force of the Universe, it can not be destroyed, it can not decay. But it exists in multiple dimensions. Souls are needed, in both the dead and living realm. Usually, the vessel driven by the soul - your body- will release the soul on it's destruction, your spirit passing on where it's needed to be. But a better way to put this is - your soul is clawing its way to the other side because it has to, and you will die one way or another. The time and place are already decided for you. \n \n But what would happen if that time never came, or that place was never visited? Or, what if your body could n't be destroyed? What if you were immortal? \n First it was subtle. I would space out every now and then - but I thought it was just side-effects of the surgery and heavy pills I was on. I wanted to be immortal because I was dying, rapidly, but like any father I wanted to see my daughter grow up. I knew friends and colleagues who had undergone the'change'. No sickness, no pain, not anymore. Just a healthy, renewed, immortal body. It was bizarre at first, but after losing my wife, I could n't leave my daughter without parents. \n \n A couple of months go by and I'm running everyday, playing with Eve, nurturing her hobbies and showing her the world, where I would once take strong pain killers laying in my bed, watching the Nanny brush her hair. The brief moments of dizziness, and lack of concentration were becoming more frequent. I'd spiral into these dazed states, sometimes not responding to any stimuli for four or five seconds. It started to become a nuisance, and when I asked other'immortal' friends, they claimed never to experience these things. \n It got to the point where I was making appointments and contacting the specialists who performed my surgery. Doctors, naturally, could see physically nothing wrong with my body, but I was starting to completely lose consciousness after a few more months pass. Not only that, but I would have insane out of body experiences, sometimes during these episodes, sometimes during sleep. I'd watch Eve playing in the garden by the pool, the Nanny folding clothes in the house, cars driving past outside. Then I'd go up, until I'm surrounded in pure white light. \n \n Then I'd see my wife. Standing, a few paces from me, in her wedding dress. I'd cry out, but as I reach for her, I'm pulled back. I never used to see my wife after she left, or even feel her - I was about as far from a spiritual person as you could imagine. I did n't believe in ghosts or the afterlife, or God, any gods, for that matter. I would soon. \n \n I figured the episodes were affecting my senses - I would hear things, see things, feel things where they were n't there. My out of body experiences were longer, and more vivid. I started to see family members and friends I'd lost. My Father, my childhood pet. I wanted to go to them so badly! I would reach out, run, crawl and drag myself towards them. They'd stare at me, expressionless, and no matter how desperately I tried, I'd feel my living, immortal body draw me back into the Earth. It was like an elastic band being stretched thinner and thinner each time. \n These events were broadening the gap each time. I could hardly stay conscious anymore, I no longer knew the day or time. I'd have vague memories, one day, of the nanny, screaming and crying hysterically, she was holding a pair of tiny, pink shoes. A phone dialling. Sirens. And I was out again. \n \n Something felt different this time as I drifted upwards. The light was warm as it surrounded me, and I can feel the tension of the elastic stronger than ever. I see my wife again, she's smiling at me this time, not expressionless or motionless, but smiling. The light is blinding, my ears ringing. And then I see her. \n Eve. The elastic snaps. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n Hi all, I'm new to this subreddit and reddit in general, I want to get into writing so I'm feeling very amateur at this point!

All of a sudden, someone you saw almost daily was no longer there. But she was just a stranger, right? Life goes on. \n \n The building was cordoned off, having been designated for demolition. You realized only then, that it was an old apartment building just like yours. In the days leading up to its end, it became a nest for rats and addicts. Sometimes you would see them in the mornings, too high to leave. \n \n The adjacent building was being designated for preservation. Construction was ongoing for a plaque that would declare if the last mayor or the local Olympic medalist had once lived there. \n \n As you rode the elevator up, you wondered what this building would be like in a century: celebrated or shunned. Well, you weren \u2019 t going to be around to find out. \n \n She wanted a divorce. \n \n The floors slid down and down again in the glass panel. The lift brings you higher and higher still, distant from the bustle of the streets on a Monday morning. \n \n That day, you didn \u2019 t get to see the old lady \u2019 s younger co-worker. You never even got to find out either of their names. You didn \u2019 t skirt round the cordon of the old apartment building that had addicts, or check if the actual plaque has finally replaced its temporary wooden counterpart. \n \n Today, the floors just kept sliding past. Perhaps you have been attentive for the first time in a long time. Perhaps it was the guilt of so many missed opportunities that were weighing you down so much that the lift was struggling. \n \n Perhaps time always stretches when one \u2019 s life is coming to an end. \n \n She had flown away to stay with her parents. That was your last missed opportunity. \n \n The floors slid on and on and you had the wild thought that perhaps you were going to crash through the roof. \n \n What was it that finally caused things to break down? Was it miscommunication or the snapping of the final shred of tolerance? Was it the time when you forgot the anniversary or the time she didn \u2019 t get a response to \u201c Do I look fat in this? \u201d \n \n When was the last time you truly fought for her? \n \n The floors slid on. Something was definitely wrong here. \n \n You thought you had given it your all with her, especially in the last couple of weeks. But is there something else to be done? \n \n You repeatedly pressed the \u201c R \u201d button impatiently. What was wrong with this lift? \n \n But there *was* something else to be done. You have fought for her, but never totally letting down your guard, never totally putting yourself out there for her to rip to shreds if she so chose. \n \n The elevator chimed *ding*. The doors slid open. You look at the LED panel, and realized that it was thirty-seventh floor although you were single-mindedly heading for the roof. \n \n You were exactly where you needed to be. You ran out of the longest elevator ride and to your apartment. Your passport was in that drawer in your room, in the home that belonged to both of you.\n"}

Everyone was excited to have a break from their daily tasks. Looking around, I found some of my friends happily chatting with the older adults on board. We often ate with them to hear stories about earth. Before it was destroyed. My friends and I never lived on the planet, but it sure sounded beautiful. Better than the thick, gray walls of this ship. \n \n Most Older Ones avoid talking about The Attack. Not the human race's finest hour. They found out the hard way there was other life in this universe, and countless others. Everyone lost a loved one. Everyone. Mostly, we hear stories about different places, cultures, events. All happier times. Happier times I've never had, but will always long for. I think I'm most disappointed I'll never experience a blue sky or my bare feet in green grass. \n \n We have a hologram room where they take salvaged pictures and display them so it looks like we're there, but it's not the same. They all say everything looks better in person. The worst part is, we're not even the generation that'll help colonize the new world. That'll be a job for my kids and grandkids. My purpose seems so unsure. \n \n I'm not even sure I want to join my friends. All to just listen to heart breaking stories? We're going to be a lost generation, we'll just live in this limbo of a ship and rot without any real experiences. Sighing I sit at the end of the table, my friends say hi and I'm greeted by Maurice, who stops his story to tell me: \n \n `` Hey, Benny! I'm just telling them about the time I went to visit one of the pyramids in Egypt. You remember those?'' \n \n `` Yes,'' I reply, hiding my dissatisfaction with just stories. We're all required to learn about Earth so we can teach it to our kids and so the memory will always be there. \n \n Why learn when you'll never be able to experience it? Renee looks over at me with a sympathetic smile. She can tell how I feel. I love her, and wish I could have been there to show her the world we had, or even the one we will have. I only half heartedly listen to Maurice's story. By now, I feel they can all feel something is off. \n \n Liza, another of the older ones leans over and says, `` Ben, if something is wrong, please tell us... we're all in this together.'' \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' I say and abruptly stand, then quicky walk away, tears pricking at my eyes. Sometimes it's just too hard to bear. A soft hand grabs mine. Renee. I know it's her. Turning, to face her, my tears are slowly running down my cheeks. Her eyes look just as broken as my heart. \n \n `` I know it's hard,'' she whispers, wrapping me in a warm hug, `` but we're facing this together. And we'll be okay. Because we need to be here. So we can make sure our race will have a bright future.'' \n \n Crying, all I can do is hug her tightly. We're in this together.\n"}

It sounded like a melody, almost like they were singing to each other. I always used to ask them why they had their own language, but they just smiled and told me; `` You will know when you get older, honey.'' \n \n I pouted, I was going to find out no matter what. I eavesdropped and memorised some of the words, `` ber\u00e4tta'', `` henne'' and `` troll''. I continued to eavesdrop, I learned a couple of words, but not much more than that. But there was always a variety of the same sentence that they repeated, but I never understood what they meant with it; `` Du vet varf\u00f6r vi g\u00f6r det, snart \u00e4r tiden inne.'' Sometimes I repeated this sentence before I was going to sleep, it made me happy, I was onto them. \n \n Last summer I found out the language they are speaking is Swedish, and since I have always wanted to learn the language I took some courses. I was so excited when I got my certificate, I went straight to my grandparents house to show them. \n \n As we drank tea I told them about my course and I repeated the phrase they always used to say; `` Du vet varf\u00f6r vi g\u00f6r det, snart \u00e4r tiden inne.'' and made some forced joke about how incredible I was to have found out their secret language.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A kid doodling in a math class accidentally creates the world 's first functional magic circle in centuries .\n","story":"Jane Young-sam felt slightly guilty even watching Mathew Isaacs doodle. She was first generation American and her parents had made her life plan fairly clear. She was to get good grades in school, especially math and science, then go to college where she \u2019 d major in a STEM field. Matt was ignoring math with such dedication that Jane felt vaguely guilty just by association. \n \n He \u2019 d flipped the paper describing their homework over, and started drawing some sort of massive doodle on the back. It looked vaguely like magic. It was all concentric rings and what looked like alchemical symbols. Jane wasn \u2019 t certain where Matt was getting it all from, especially given how high he generally was during math. \n \n Jane looked back at the board. She hadn \u2019 t missed anything; they were still factoring polynomials. She looked back over at Matt in time to see him finish the last symbol with a little flourish. He looked up and grinned over at her. She gave him a small smile in return. Against all odds, Matt and Jane were friends. He came from a good family, so her parents approved of him. They were somewhat na\u00efve about American drug culture; they thought he was just calm. \n \n The period bell rang and all the other students instantly started packing their books. The math teacher said something about their homework, but his voice didn \u2019 t carry over the general bustle. \n \n \u201c Check it out, \u201d Matt said. He raised his hand and intoned, \u201c I summon the power of the universe! \u201d Then he planted his hand right in the center of the doodle. He was definitely baked. \n \n Only, the circle responded. All the points where his hand touched it lit with electric blue light and those little points raced out through the remainder of the doodle lighting the entire thing brightly. \n \n \u201c Whoooaa, \u201d Matt started to say. He was interrupted as the light jumped from the circle to his flesh, and all the little lines in his skin lit with the same electric blue. It raced across his body making him look like a bad computer graphic. When it reached his eyes they flashed brightly. The light vanished. There was an electrical scent in the air. \n \n \u201c What did you do? \u201d Jane could hear the angry scolding tone in her voice. She sounded like her grandmother. Normally that would have bothered her, but clearly whatever Matt had done warranted a good incredulous scolding. \n \n \u201c You are not my master. \u201d Matt \u2019 s inflection was flat and his tone vibrated a little through registers not normally associated with human speech. \n \n \u201c Are you OK? \u201d \n \n \u201c I am optimal. This host can focus much magic. However, you are not my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c No, I suppose not. \u201d \n \n \u201c Take me to my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c Are you a demon? \u201d Jane didn \u2019 t much believe in western demons. However, her grandmother had told her stories of a great many Korean evil spirits that might do in a pinch. From those stories, Jane was fairly certain there was nothing they \u2019 d enjoy better than causing trouble for a boy who doodled in math class. \n \n \u201c I am a magical construct. My master can explain. Take me to my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c Do you know where he is? \u201d \n \n \u201c My master is the wizard of Iron Mountain. Take me to him. \u201d \n \n \u201c Does that have a zip code? \u201d \n \n \u201c Take me to my master. \u201d \n \n Jane had lunch after math, and she had been looking forward to it, but she decided she had an obligation to help her friend. \u201c Follow me, we may be able to get you to your master. \u201d \n \n ~ ~ ~ \n \n \u201c Is there any possibility he has taken narcotics. \u201d Mr. Taylor was the school \u2019 s physics professor and the smartest person Jane had access to on short notice. \n \n Jane considered it a near certainty that Matt had taken narcotics. However, intoxication seemed an unlikely explanation for his shift in demeanor. She equivocated, \u201c It doesn \u2019 t seem like drugs. If it \u2019 s a Korean evil spirit, they are terribly superstitious. We may be able to drive it off by serving tea the wrong way. Actually, maybe that makes them angry. I could call my grandmother. \u201d \n \n Mr. Taylor raised his eyebrows at her. \u201c I \u2019 ll find it very distressing if this boy is possessed by an evil spirit. \u201d \n \n \u201c I am a magical construct. My master can explain. Take me to my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c What does a magical construct do? \u201d \n \n \u201c I process information using a matrix of magical energy and physical force. I cast and assist in spells. I serve my master. Take me to my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c So Matt \u2019 s the physical matrix? \u201d \n \n \u201c Matt provides magical power. My master can explain, take me to my master. \u201d \n \n Jane considered the answers Mr. Taylor had been given. \u201c Sounds like a computer. \u201d \n \n Taylor tapped his fingers on his desk. \u201c I suppose that would follow. If you wanted magic to do something on its own it would need to process instructions much like a computer. Actually, I wonder if the physical force it \u2019 s talking about is electromagnetic fields. If so, we might drive it out by scrambling those fields. \u201d \n \n Jane shrugged. It seemed as reasonable has her own tea based theories. Taylor crossed to a cabinet at the back of his room and pulled out something that looked rather like a bracelet with a plug on it. A grounding strip. That might work. In case it didn \u2019 t, Jane pulled a clip from her hair and began to work loose its spring. \n \n \u201c Here, put this on, \u201d Taylor instructed the possible evil spirit, possible magical computer. \n \n \u201c Take me to my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c If you put this on, I may take you to your master. \u201d \n \n Matt took the bracelet and slipped it on. Taylor gestured him over to an outlet and plugged the bracelet in to the ground. Nothing happened. \u201c You will now take me to my master. \u201d \n \n Taylor scowled, \u201c We had better take him to the school nurse. \u201d He took the anti-static bracelet back. \n \n \u201c The school nurse is not my master. \u201d \n \n \u201c One moment, you \u2019 ve given me an idea. Here, slip this in those slots. After that, we go to your master. \u201d Jane handed the spring to Matt and gestured at the outlet he was standing next to. \n \n \u201c Wait! \u201d \n \n Matt ignored Taylor and slipped the spring into the electrical socket. There was a flash, the lights in the room cut out, and Matt stiffened convulsively throwing him across the room and into one of the student tables. Jane smelled ozone for the second time that day. \n \n Slowly Matt stood up, \u201c Whooooaaa, what happened? \u201d \n \n \u201c You could have killed him! \u201d \n \n \u201c You think that \u2019 s the first time I \u2019 ve seen Matt do something stupid with an electrical outlet? \u201d Jane turned to Matt, \u201c Next time pay attention in math class. Oh, and don \u2019 t touch your math homework. I \u2019 m not bailing you out a second time. \u201d \n \n Then she left for what remained of her lunch period.\n"}

He looked up a him with a haughty, stressed expression. Jack got the impression the small electronics shop was n't doing too good. The shelves were dusty, and there were cobwebs everywhere. Assorted cables hung spread out over the various racks and display cases, covering some of the lights and giving the whole place a cramped, dark atmosphere. \n \n `` Do you sell power adapters?'' \n \n The guy behind the counter looked at him with a puzzled expression. \n \n `` I need to plug in my charger. US plug.'' \n \n It had been a long flight, and it had been well over 24 hours since Jack had last seen a bed. His phone had been dead since the stopover in Hong Kong. He really wanted to check his messages. \n \n The manager rummaged around in one of the shelves behind the counter, and produced a blisterpacked converter. It was a cheaply made, Chinese piece of shit, but it was going to cost him an arm and a leg, Jack knew. No matter what power standard you need converting to another, it's never cheap. \n \n Jack rummaged around his wallet for the money he got from the ATM at the airport earlier. He produced two 20 dollar bills, still crisp, and handed them over to the shopkeeper. The money seemed colorful; it had a picture of some guy Jack did n't recognize. He wondered vaguely who it was. The shopkeeper handed him the converter and some change, without saying a word. \n \n As Jack was making his way to the exit, his leg caught on one of the loose cords that was hanging from one of the shelves. He whipped his arm around, searching for purchase, but found none. As his body twisted around, mid-fall, the dumpy shop manager was suddenly hovering over him, his face a few inches away from his own. Jack had n't even seen him move. The small man held him up by his outstretched arm, apparently without effort. \n \n `` Thank you'' Jack mumbled. `` This place is a death trap.'' \n \n Jack got back on to his feet, but the manager held on to his arm. \n \n `` No really, thank you.'' Said Jack, puzzled. `` I hope I did n't break anything.'' \n \n Jack looked around. The exit was only a couple of feet behind his back. He started moving towards it, but the guy clung to his arm with surprising strength. Something was off about the man's appearance. He was wearing an odd shirt, black, shiny, with a dull orange-red stripe down the back. His pants, also black, seemed ill-fitting and baggy. A belt was pulled tightly around his small waist in an effort to hold them up. \n \n The shopkeeper said nothing, holding on to his arm. \n \n Jack pulled towards the door, the only real source of light in the place. People walked by, but did not give a second glance to the little dark shop, with its window full of outdated electronics and dust. Panic started to get a hold of him. He struggled to break free of the hold on his arm, and managed to grab hold of the door's handle. \n \n `` Sir, please, let go of my arm. I've paid you for the adapter, more than what it was worth, even. What do you want from me?'' Jack implored. \n \n The shopkeeper stood silent, trying to pull Jack back into the shop. He had pushed his legs against a shelve, in an effort to gain more purchase. Jack could feel the sleeve of his jacket starting to tear. He held on to the handle with all the power in his left arm. \n \n As the sleeve of his jacket ripped off, the manager lost grip of his arm. Jack stumbled and fell. He kicked his legs trying to get out the door. The shopkeeper was closing in on him silently with a dead look in his eyes. As Jack worked his half-prone body out the door into the bright sunlight, a businessman stepped around him, apparently without caring about what was going on. \n \n The guy stopped moving, and looked on from the dark shop as Jack got to his feet. \n \n `` What the hell, man?'' Jack said. \n \n The manager, looked up at him, and with a voice, not quite human, managed to let out a single, mangled word. \n \n `` G'day'' \n\n"}

After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world. Nothing could prepare everyone for what was next. \n \n If you're lost, the best way to explain this is from the beginning. \n \n David was a nice boy from Brooklyn who enjoyed normal 80's activities for 10 year old boys of which I know none of, maybe playing with slinky's or riding penny boards, or wearing tiny shorts or something. Anyways he loved being a kid, until one fateful day he was abducted in the middle of the night. To his avail this was n't an ordinary abduction, yes that day David was abducted by the gods of rock. He had previously listened to some Beatles and other popular rock artists of the past decades but music was something David ultimately dismissed as he frolicked through the 1980's doing 1980's things. \n \n After this night everything changed for David Draiman of Disturbed. \n \n David moved from city to city after that and began tuning out the observant Jewish tradition and tuning in his heavy guitar based music. He began `` rebelling against comformity'' to become a `` normal teenage kid'' started his own band in the different cities including L.A. and Milwaukee, and began practicing the religion of rock first and Judaism second. His parents were furious at times, but David was set to complete the voyage the rock gods sent him on all those years before. The 80's came and went, and all of his idols were becoming irrelevant as well. This sprung in the age of Heavy Metal. The first Metallica song David heard actually made him convulse due to the prolific nature and beauty of the intense rhythmic chords. The vocals, guitar, bass, and drums all created a wondrous symphony that David could not turn his ear from. \n \n Over the following decade acts such as Nirvana, Sublime, and Red Hot Chili Peppers emerged as top contenders with hit singles and albums that inspired David Draiman to link up with a struggling band called Disturbed in 1996 after they had a falling out with their lead signer. \n \n His destiny was almost complete, and rock gods sat there all this time patiently watching as he David scaled, nearing the top of the Rock Olympus. \n \n It was then that they gave him the final gift. \n \n David, did not know what was happening to him. He did not feel right. \n \n He tried to fight it but his condition worsened and he did not know what to do to relieve himself of his ailment. \n \n He was a medical mystery, stricken and cursed he was inflicted with the most awful of pains to ever touch. \n \n He tried turning to music but any song he played would not play correctly. \n \n A few chords sounded okay and with very specific patterns as well. \n \n It was at this point he knew that he was being tested by the rock gods. \n \n `` After constant struggle, months of battling it, he could no longer contain it. It was itching to break out, to explode into the world.

The moon lit up this piece of Earth only, so David grabbed his Fender and set for the spotlight of the gods. \n \n He played those chords he played all those months prior and knew what the sickness was. He knew all he had to do was embrace it and so would everyone else. People came, and surrounded as played a mild intro. Slowly the other Disturbed band members joined and knew what to play as well. \n \n He asked the crowd if they could feel it as well as he described the reasons why they should stop resisting. \n \n Then all fell quiet as David prepared and yelled as everyone embraced it just as the gods planned over 20 years before now sitting in the heavens above proud as they watch they're disciple accomplish what dreamed of. \n \n Then David came on the mic and the reverb took over the world. \n \n \n `` GET UP, COME ON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS!'' \n \n \n \n Fin. \n \n [ Get Down With The Sickness by Disturbed ] ( http: \/\/youtu.be\/09LTT0xwdfw )\n"}

Icy looks passed between the two fathers and the children peeked out from behinds their legs. David poking out his tongue. \n \n Mr Mitchell fussed around, setting up the replica while Mr Mifflin suddenly found reason to recheck the placement of the 42 scale trees he had carefully created from scratch. The checking continued frantically, each father slapping away his child's attempts to help, right up until the judges arrived at their tables. \n \n The lead judge was, as always, Dr Smith, the schools head teacher but this year he had with him a guest judge - Michelle Wallis, a local Chemist who had joined the PTA and whose own daughter was just a few years from her first competition. Mr Mortis trailed behind them. `` Well well, what a fine pair of volcanos!'' Dr Smith's voice boomed out. `` Say, it might be fun to judge them together?''

Then slowly a rumbling filled the room and then a sudden roar. \n \n Smoke billowed from the volcano is great clouds and around the room several small children cheered. Then, gloriously, deep red minion began to ooze out of the top and slowly make its way down the mode with a sufficiently sulferous smell. It engulfed the villages and trees and the room spontaneously broke into applause. \n \n `` It's sugar'' Mr Mifflin explained happily `` a perfect analogue for magma and an excellent way to understand this process.'' \n \n Dr Smith started a round of applause which range though the hall. `` Well done, very good Sarah.''

This will not do *at all*!'' \n \n Commander Stirling stared at the ruptured Seedpod, still hovering on its Podkletnov thrusters at the penultimate landing stage. The natives had constructed their rude temple around it. The temple lay at the heart of the planet's lush jungle: perfumed breezes, the sweet rustle of leaves, cool drops of falling water, so reminiscent of the lost primal days of Earth. `` Eden'', breathed his companion. \n \n Stirling fumed. `` This is a class I breach. We've *terraformed* a planet with a native civilization.'' \n \n Science Specialist Hu stroked his beard thoughtfully. His habit of doffing helmet the moment the microbe scan was done annoyed Stirling to no end. `` This planet seems to have no microorganisms. Everything we see is DNA-based. None of these plants is really an Earth species, but they contain proteins related to Earth plants. There do n't seem to be two biospheres at work here.'' \n \n `` Then who built the temple? ``, Stirling asked. \n \n `` I do n't know. But what if we are not the only species studying uninhabited planets? They might have brought the Seedpod to an outpost to study it, and breached the contents.'' \n \n `` Impossible! These are the high-diversity equatorial coordinates the landing algorithm would have selected. This feature was constructed around it.'' \n \n `` True. More importantly, we have n't seen the natives. We do n't know that they are alien at all. Until we find aliens somewhere, they are an extraordinary explanation.'' \n \n `` What else could they be?'' \n \n `` I have been thinking about it. You know that the Seedpod contains optimization facilities: in vitro selection, aptamer-based modular protein design, and a library of hazard resistance programs?'' \n \n `` So? These only fine-tune the organisms the Pods release.'' \n \n `` Well, the implementation is biotechnological. What if a suite of adaptation tools itself is what was released?'' \n \n `` They ca n't adapt indefinitely, blindly. There is a maximum speed at which life can evolve, and they have no template.'' \n \n `` But what if there is a template - what if they had access to the Seedpod's databases?'' \n \n Stirling paused a moment to think that through. Certainly there were biological transponders used in human medicine. If they could download the sequences... \n \n `` You mean these natives might be human?'' \n \n `` Maybe. The sequence was in the computer. But they may differ from humans as much as these plants differ from Hawaiian flora.'' \n \n The four-man crew had a long history together. Stirling did not actually need to issue the order to return to the ship, nor did he need to tell Hu to run back the hundred meters. \n \n To the place where the bodies of their crewmates waited for them. \n \n To the roar of the rocket engines as they completed their final countdown. \n \n There was no explaining how the aliens had accessed the ship, or blocked communications, or hacked into the systems, or overpowered their friends. \n \n `` You might as well lose that helmet'', Hu said. \n \n This was their home now. It came with sweet air, pure water, a passable shelter, and even food. A thousand unknown plants surrounded them. Many of them bore fruit, and the equatorial summer would never end. \n \n Hu bit deep into the first fruit he had selected. `` Devoid of toxins... not of flavor!'' He handed one to Stirling, who took an exploratory nibble. \n \n `` If this is a Garden of Eden, do you suppose there is a Tree of Life and a Tree of Knowledge?'' \n \n Hu stroked his beard. `` Well, the lifeforms did develop with a versatile toolset for communicating with the pod... and the natives did manage to get the access codes for the ship somehow...'' \n \n He stared at the fruit. And the Seedpod. He thought about a race so driven to spread its seed that it literally sent ships to the stars to prepare them for someday human colonists. What would the offspring of such a race be like? Would they evolve, prepare themselves for the chance to do the same to Earth? Were they studying him now, to learn more about how humans think? \n \n `` I do n't know'', he said.\n"}

He flick his hand out again and the scenery changed. Soon both of them were standing in an airport. To their left, a young woman was sitting on the floor, desperately trying to shove all her possessions back into a ruptured suitcase. `` This is where we met.'' Johan said quietly, `` The day my life change.'' \n \n A younger Johan ran onto the scene and helped the woman with her predicament. Eventually an announcement rang out about a deporting flight and soon both of them were running down the terminal with arms full of clothing and nicknacks. \n \n `` If it was n't for me, she would n't had made it.'' said Johan fondly, `` It was there, Natalie gave me her phone number.'' \n \n The scenery flashed again, revealing Johan and Natalie dining at a restaurant in Paris; three years since the airport incident. His younger self then got on one knee and pulled a box from his pocket. \n \n `` I had to get her the most expensive diamond out there.'' said Johan, `` I just had too.'' \n \n `` You're still not seeing it.'' the devil said disappointingly. \n \n They skimmed through his marriage, the countless anniversaries, the day they bought a house together, every trip they ever been on, every gift they gave, every moment he felt happy. Finally they flashed back to the car crash. \n \n `` What does every event have in common?'' asked the devil. \n \n `` I'm with Natalie?'' \n \n `` No, idiot! You were drowning in luxury!'' the devil cried out, `` From the first moment you touched the fine satin of her luggage clothing, to the Paris restaurant, to the diamonds and trips, and big house on the beach. You only tolerated this woman because she was loaded. God knows, there's nothing else to this Natalie, no personality or looks, just money.'' \n \n `` Shut the Hell up!'' yelled Johan angrily. \n \n The devil laughed, `` you know her wealth is not going to last forever right? You know it's waning as we speak. Natalie has foolishly put the last of it into some last minutes investments and they're all going to fail. No more riches for poor Johan, no more fancy blitz. You and Natalie are going to be dirt poor and the thought is driving you mad.'' \n \n `` SHUT UP!'' Johan cried. \n \n `` Do n't fret.'' the devil laughed, `` today I'm going to introduce you to your true love. A little miss named winning lottery ticket, but you ai n't getting her until I have your soul.'' \n \n `` I already gave you my soul.'' \n \n `` I should clarify, your soul- *mate,'' * the devil said, `` The act of marriage bonded your two souls together. You own her heart and she owns yours, and like any possession, you can sell it for something better. Just give me Natalie and I'll restore your wealth.'' \n \n Johan heard sirens roaring in the distance. \n \n `` Time's a ticking.'' \n \n He closed his eyes and muttered his answer, wondering what he chose to give up was worth it.\n"}

This one was in the middle of the Dessert of Atlanta. The temples where simple, giant boxes. Filled with giant monoliths and strange tubes. Elmer said that these were temples of knowledge, commerce, and communication. The ancients did everything at these temples. \n \n After clearing the trees and growth out of the way, we found the door. It was a small gray one-person door. \n \n `` If these temples were as important as you say, how could everyone get in an out through such a small door?'' I asked. \n \n `` Nobody actually went to these temples. Only a few monks who cleaned them and maintained them.'' Elmer said. \n \n `` You said they did everything at these temples? They traded, they learned, they taught. How did they do that without coming to them?''. I was having a hard time understanding Elmer. He was very smart, but sometimes he did n't make sense. \n \n `` I'm not exactly sure, but I think they had little shrines in their house, or prayer books. They used the shrine through those.'' He said. \n \n `` I thought you did n't believe in magic.'' I retorted. He did n't reply. \n \n I used an axe to break the lock on the door. Elmer told me this was the largest temple he had ever seen. There had to be thousands of the monoliths. Each of the monoliths had about fifty drawers on the front, and a small symbol on the front of each drawer. \n \n We went to the back of the temple. There was a giant tank next to a strange looking machine. Elmer said that if we could make the machine work, the temple would become active. He shook the tank, it was filled with a foul smelling liquid. He pulled a crank on the machine. It made a loud growling sound, but then it sputtered and stopped. After he twisted some nobs on the machine and pulled the crank again, the machine started growling again and it did n't stop. \n \n The monoliths lit up as if there were hundreds of fireflies on each of them. We went to a small room off to the side of temple. In this room there where small shrines, with dark pieces of glass, windows to nowhere, sitting on top of each of them. Elmer said the monks that lived here, called `` techs'', would use these pieces of glass to see what was happening in the temple. \n \n Elmer pushed a button on one of the shrines. He started touching some strange jewels on it. They made a clacking sound as he touched them. \n \n `` This is it. We've found it. This was their temple of knowledge.'' \n \n I looked at the window to nowhere on the shrine. It was lit up, and showing pictures. At the top of the picture, was the word `` Wikipedia''. \n\n"}

His research suggests he has found cures for several major diseases and wo n't divulge unless all charges are dropped .\n","story":"I do n't know why I did n't quit. \n \n Eight long years working with a demon. The worst part was that he did n't sound like one. No sneering, no catchphrases. Just a co-worker in his mid forties with a slight paunch, and thick glasses. Occasionally funny. Focused on his work. It's no wonder he was able to get away with it for so long. He seemed to wince when I injected a rat. How could he experiment on 63 people? \n \n Sixty-three. That number rang in my head every day. 63. 63, all with parents, children, boyfriends, classmates, sisters. \n \n Babysitters. \n \n It was horrific. \n \n Not just the things that he did, but the way he spoke about them. Like they were animals - no, like they were plants. He talked about them like he was experimenting on tree branches. Just... total detachment. \n \n But we needed him, and he knew it. And he was brilliant. I guess Goebbels was brilliant, too. He was more than brilliant. Except for the live torture, murder, and human medical testing, he was a gift from God. \n \n We tried for 6 months to break his codes, but everything was in his brain. The notebooks - with his customized, personally invented language - were incomplete and useless even when we translated them. We had only ever figured out a few pages, the short ones, which he had mumbled to himself as he read. The linguists managed to figure out that there were hints of Chinese, Hebrew, and Latin, but some influence from that Lord of the Rings elf writing. And I think it was the junior lab assistant who recognized the Klingon. Dumb fucker thought he cracked the code. He ran around the office shouting `` I GOT IT.'' No, you figured out a single word. \n \n So he made a deal. He would help us decipher his notebooks, test and produce the cures, as an equal partner in the lab. After that, he would be heavily monitored, but he was free to go. He was restricted, of course, with those gloves, so he could use his hands, but they could lock up with the touch of a button. They only used them once, and I think it was a misunderstanding. He did n't seem to want to hurt anyone. He did n't seem to want to help anyone. It was as if he just liked the work for the sake of the work itself. \n \n And the cures did come. Those people gave their lives for something. \n \n First it was liver cancer - 89 % effectiveness. Then glaucoma - 100 %. Diabetes reversed with three weeks of treatment. IBS, for some reason. Then brain cancer - 75 % effective. Then breast cancer - 95 % effective. All the cancer walks and fundraising stopped after that. \n \n AIDS - destroyed. 100 %. He said there were no more STD treatments, though. He could have, but he thought they were important. Down's Syndrome - 100 % treatable with fetal testing. Autism only showed a 40 % improvement - I knew that galled him. He told us we were doing something wrong, insisted to review the system. Sure enough, someone had substituted a protein base in the treatment - it was fixed, and autism was cured. Just like that. \n \n I should have been celebrating. Everyone was celebrating. Some of the other lab rats were celebrating, even though they knew what it had taken to get us these cures. And the news. Every night on the news, a huge celebration as a pediatric cancer ward was turned into a juvenile psychological unit, and then 4 years later, they just shut it down, with anxiety and bipolar disorders cured, and depression now 80 % treatable. \n \n I could n't. I hated the cured almost as much as I hated my sociopathic co-worker. \n \n Every disease that was cured - at the cost of the little boy I nannied for 4 years, who was like a son to me. He was tortured as a lab rat by my co-worker, Dr. John Hale, for the last three years of his life. I promised myself when I got the job - Dr. Hale would never be free.\n"}

In the war room of the last stronghold of Qwarezm, he finally had the dictator at hand. All he needed was to shoot him, and the war would be over. The generalissimo did not seem scared of his impending death. He spoke with a deep baritone voice, unshaken. \n \n `` Where are you from, soldier?'' \n \n `` No talk, tyrant.'' \n \n `` What does it matter? I will die today. You do not look like the typical rabble that rises up against my government. For one thing, you are white. For another, you speak English.'' \n \n ``...'' \n \n `` And why are you here in my country, fighting the progress we are bringing?'' \n \n `` Progress? Your soldiers have murdered and massacred thousands, millions of innocent civilians. Your own people. You have stifled democracy, destroyed the political opposition, ruined the economy with your ridiculous attempts at industrialization.'' He felt stronger with each accusation. `` Our forces are fighting for freedom. For liberty. For self-determination. This country shall choose its own leader. Your prisons that were once full of thought criminals will be emptied.'' \n \n The guerilla looked down upon the generalissimo, expecting a look of defeat, but saw only a smile. A smirk. There was a long pause, and the guerilla kept staring into the smug, know-it-all grin of the general. \n \n `` Have you ever wondered why the capital was so hard to take for your'forces'? Have you ever wondered who my supporters are?'' \n \n `` Your supporters are coerced.'' \n \n `` I assure you, they are not. They feel a certain pressure to support me, certainly. But that pressure is not created by me. In the capital, it is the college students who support me. Especially women. Women who will lose all their rights when your'freedom fighters' come in and take away their freedoms. \n \n When my regime overthrew the king, we found a country with a literacy rate of 2 percent. We raised it. We had to. Because we found a world where the West was dominant. In a world with a dominant, industrial, capitalist West, the only way to join the club was to become industrial, capitalist and Westernized. How could we compete without educating our people? Educating our people creates demands for freedom. So now, our universities are full of students. Last year was the year we finally had more graduates from engineering school than from the madrasa. \n \n All you saw on your cacophonous shouting programs that you call news was cases of torture. Did they tell you how much we raised the GDP of our country? How many people we lifted from poverty? The slave markets we closed down? The welfare systems we created? The sectarian violence we stopped, the same sects that are now closing in on this stronghold.'' \n \n The guerilla could feel his grip on the gun loosening a bit. The generalissimo could sense it, and laughed. \n \n `` And now here you are.'' \n \n `` Talk all you want, General. You wo n't change my mind.'' The word felt as hollow as they sounded. \n \n The generalissimo laughed even harder now. \n \n `` I do not intend to change your mind. I simply wish to have a nice conversation before you inevitably shoot me. We are surrounded. When the rebels overrun this base, they will immediately set up a new government. They will execute all the professors in the universities. They will rape all women who are uncovered. They will take all the children of all of my soldiers, and reopen the slave markets with them. And they will find every. Single. Foreigner. Who did not fight with them. No matter what you do, you have to shoot me, in order to get out of here alive, and to go back to where you came from...'' \n \n `` Michigan.'' \n \n `` It's lovely this time of year. I studied there.'' \n \n The Generalissimo hummed an American folk tune and closed his eyes, and waved the guerilla away, as if to say the conversation was over.

Dad \u2019 s shoulders were usually steady, but that day they shivered from the rhythm of his bellowing laughter, as he propped Tim up to paint. Tim waved the brush around wildly, making white paint rain down on them both. It was such fun. \n \n It was getting bright now, the sky outside must be full of colors unlike the blue of the ceiling. Tim wondered if the sky in the room was meant to make him want to go outside where the colors were brighter. \n \n It was getting bright, and yet no one had come to wake him up. It was the dreaded Monday and he supposedly had school.

It was something like, \u201c Yeeeeeeeee \u201d. \n \n Sometimes, Tim imagined the Sun to be a roaring fireball, boiling with rage as it rose above them all. If the Sun wanted to, perhaps he could drop himself onto Tim and totally flatten him. He imagine the Sun would be really, really hot. He made it a point not to look at the Sun directly like Dad and Mrs. Thomson at school had once said. \n \n But the Sun rejected that imagery, being silent and steady in its ascent.

Well this was the last straw, cold shower this morning and keys not even going in the keyhole was just too much, I resolved to call him and give him an earful as soon as I got in. \n \n I rang the doorbell; at least Karen would be in, she'd just been getting in the shower when I left for the paper and so hopefully she was out by now and dried, or she would moan at me for making her track water through the house. \n \n The door opened and Karen was there, she looked at me and her face was in shock, mine must have been a bit surprised too as her eyes were red and puffy as if she had been crying. She stood, frozen. \n \n `` My God'' What's wrong, I reached out and touched her and it seemed to break the spell. \n \n She screamed and hurled herself into my arms, her voice incoherent but I could just pick out a few words'missing','thank god','dead'. I half carried her through towards the living room but as I got into the hallway Karen's mother burst from the Kitchen. Karen was still strung around my neck in tears. \n \n `` Daniel?'' Karen's mother began as if she had no idea who I was `` Jesus, thank god'' she ran forward and joined Karen in hugging me. \n \n `` What's going on? I managed to ask through the hugs. Mary, is it Jack?'' Her father had a bad heart `` Is Jack okay? What happened?'' \n \n Her mother broke away and looked at me puzzled `` Where have you been?'' Her face was pleading and confused. \n \n I pulled Karen away from me, she was finally starting to make sense again `` Where have you been?'' I could now make out her asking too. \n \n `` Er, the 7-11?'' I gestured to the bag I was carrying, for the paper and, y'know, milk?'' I opened the bag and pulled the milk out, through the plastic it was brown and curdled. `` What the fuck? I just bought this, fucking 7-11!'' My voice rose in irritation. \n \n Karen looked up into my face `` Daniel, you've been gone for a week, where have you been?'' \n \n This was either a very strange and well done prank or something very odd had happened. `` I... I do n't know what's going on.'' Karen burst into tears again. \n \n Hours later the police had questioned me thoroughly and no one seemed to be any the wiser. As far as I could tell the 7-11 cameras showed me leaving the store and getting into my car. Traffic cams showed me almost all the way home but lost me when I left the main road and then, nothing. No sign of me, or my car for a week. \n \n A doctor had checked me and I showed no signs of trauma or malnutrition. The only signs that anything at all had happened was the soles of my shoes which had melted slightly and hardened again. The police did not like that and they had been taken away with all of my clothes. \n \n For now they were claiming that I had either had a psychotic break or, the unspoken alternative was that I had done this myself and this was a big act. I could hear the policeman in the kitchen explaining to Karen that it was not uncommon for men at my age, which was only 34 for God's sake, to decide to'peace out' for a bit and enjoy a bit of freedom without my family. Just normally they would have found some spending on credit cards but on me there was nothing. \n \n Karen finally would let me out of her sight for a moment, I'm not sure that she cared what had happened to me, she was so happy that I was home. After all the cups of tea I pretty desperately needed to pee and so I slipped into our en suite and let loose into the toilet. \n \n Humming a happy tune, the day had been strange but not traumatic for me at least, I looked around. All normal here. I looked down and things were not normal. My pee was blue, dark blue. I panicked, this was definitely unusual and the doctor had been clear, anything unusual and I should let people know. \n \n I tried to stop the flow but 6 cups of tea in a couple of hours had done their job and it was impossible. A new thought occurred to me, I should save some of this. Looking around there was nothing in reach that I could use and so with a quick whipping motion I moved across to the sink and pushed down the plug. I hoped Karen would forgive me. \n \n The sink slowly filled with blue pee and I felt a deep relief, in fact I felt good. Really really good. I felt like taking off my T-shirt good and so standing in the bathroom that's what I did. \n \n I felt good enough to peel off my chest but that would be ridiculous but still, I could almost feel how good it would be. As my chest opened up and my ribs spread back to reveal my innards I felt an almost orgasmic sense or relief and pleasure. It looked so funny looking down, my chest open, blue pee flowing and the shine of the metallic organs whirring and beating in perfect synchronicity.\n"}

How could *she* have possibly broken *my* nose? That's nine days suspension, what knocked me out had to be her golden ring. The only thing I could think about clearly was how jealous of her I was and how angry I am that *she* had the nerve to practically almost *Kill* me. Everytime we've ever spoken one word to eachother it was to torment one another out of spite over a dumb boy. A fight over a dumb boy, wow. Thinking about that really pissed me off. \n Two minutes in to ranting in my own head my thoughts were interrupted. I could n't figure out what was going on, my head voice sounded raspy and equally mad. \n *I should n't be suspended for five days, I did n't start the fight. I'm an honors student for Christ sake. Fucking Amy should back off Mike because he wo n't ever like her..ugh*. Well, *my* names Amy... Could it be possible I was reading her thoughts? I could n't be right? Inside her mind? No way. \n *Now everyones going to hate me because I fucking knocked out someone no even cares about in the first place. Moms gon na come home so pissed... maybe if I pretend to be asleep she wo n't yell. * The thoughts that were n't mine continued. \n I could n't imagine anyone hating her, in this High School she was pretty popular, I mean she has gorgeous hair, a pretty face, a slick attitude getting boys to do whatever she wanted and to top it all off, which really disappointing me, she had a great fashion sense.I almost feel bad for getting blood on her mint colored tanktop, almost.She is more likely to date Mike than me but did she need to knock me out to prove a point? Somehow the situation would get twisted around and everyone would feel compassion for her, that's how it always works around here. \n \n Five days later, with her thoughts still running through my mind we passed each other in the Science Hallway, almost right where our fight began.If I'm not delusional my blood is still on the floor a few inches away, gross. \n *Fuck there she is, do n't look do n't look....* How could she pull off being internally nervous but externally looking like absolutely nothing had happened? I really got to know her these past few days and what I discovered is she's not as great as she showcases herself.It turns out all this time I was jealous of her she was jealous of me too, Scared I would actually get the boy I wanted.It's really funny how that works. \n The event vividly replayed in my head. The bell to leave second block had rang, on my way out of my Chemistry Class with Mike and her behind me I heard whispering.There was always a pattern going on, if they were together near me they would probably be talking about me.It kind of gave me joy, to know how much I annoyed her.I could n't stand it anymore though so I turned around hoping to confront her, I always had the idea she liked Mike so now was the perfect time. \n While turning my head to face the two I said, `` Listen, I know you're jealous'' i assumed anyway ( come to find five days later I was right ) `` and I ca n't figure out why'' my voice sounded so fake, I sounded like a total bitch. `` But if you like Mike, just ask him out he's right there. And would n't it really piss me off if *you* dated *him*? Because the only reason you hate me is because you think I have a chance of dating him.'' I was smiling and to my amazement that's when she knocked me out. I had no desire to start a fight with her but the truth burns people sometimes. \n \n I snapped back to reality leaning against my locker with her just a few lockers down. I could see her looking at me from the corner of my eye. Should n't she apologize to me? A simple'Hey sorry I broke your nose and smashed your face in' to say the least. \n *Come on Dani hurry up, hurry up she might come over..

Just walk away... * I saw her body jerk planning to just ignore me but before her friends walked with her I began talking. \n `` Listen, I know you're still jealous'' I began. `` And pissed because everyone pretty much hates you for starting a petty fight'' I felt the smirk on my face and heard the unofficial suicide thoughts running through her mind, *Fucking kill me, im going to kill myself. shes going to knock me out* \n `` But If you have any heart at all you'll forgive *me* for actually starting the fight over Mike which was dumb'' all she could think was how bad she felt for harming me and it really was absurd. *Why is she apologizing to me? * she questioned \n `` I'm apologizing because I know you wont, and I know it really pisses you off to know I'm the bigger person'' *Shit, she was right* \n We both turned our head to find Mike looking at us and this time we we both felt the same feeling, embarrassed and horrified. \n After my apology her thoughts began fading away but for as long as I knew what she was thinking she felt pretty guilty, which made me a little satisfied.\n"}

Far away from her, bottles clinked, ravens croaked; the very two, she realized, that she had heard in the wind. \n \n She was finally here. She'd reached the Worldfather's domain... or rather, as he preferred here, `` Odin.'' Her minuscule feet shivered on the floor -- this was the first time she'd transcended any dimension she knew of, and if she were lucky, the last as well. \n \n `` Why yes, my child. Come closer that I may see you.'' \n \n The room held a strange, almost unending enormity. As one might see the Solar Realm from a great deal away, if they were astronomically large.... And yet Amymone did n't notice any sort of unreal size to the objects here. Made for a man either Kimahn's size or barely larger, fur-lined clothes, heaping piles of pelts, and even human remains simply sat in antiquity around her... nothing so tall that it would overwhelm completely. \n \n `` F-Father -- \u201d She knew that as one of Dwarven blood, and a descendant of someone Odin had personally created, this was her burden. `` I come with a... a humble request.... It involves someone you might know only from his grandparents.'' Carefully she stepped down the stone floor... and bleakly realized her first thoughts had erred. This was indeed a far larger place than she'd known, and Odin was certainly going to be larger than Kimahn. \n \n `` But of course. I remember Eldis... and poor dear Ilsa. You would know from tales that eventually, Ilsa came to love her brute of a husband.'' \n \n ``... I.... \u201d She passed what she'd thought were human bones. She'd been too far away to realize these were the petrified remains of a Jotunn... those great and terrible giants that'd roamed Midgar as well as Jotunnheim. Heimdallr had been one of these. \n \n This room itself defied possibility. It was not simply a man's scrivening chamber, nor was it a stone-walled dwelling like those in Nhanon. Dveldheim was simply a scrap of granite in this place, and Brobdinia... A single ember, she pondered, could likely contain the whole of it. \n \n `` I know of your needs, my child. Favored of L\u00e9sa. You were his very image from the day you sprang forth from Delila's womb. I recall telling Freya -- \u201d Huginn, or Muninn, interrupted him with a cry. `` Oh yes, you are right. I was telling *Freyr* that this little maid in front of me now would someday ascend to where her parents had never seen, to intercede for a man whose father had slain hers. The sins of a father should never visit upon a child if they reject him. And Valery's children.... \u201d A deep, booming laugh erupted from the Worldfather. `` Why, only one of them obeyed him! The other three wish nothing to do with his loathsome acts.'' \n \n ``... Father, does he have three? Or simply two?'' \n \n `` You do not know? \u201d \n \n `` No, \u201d Amymone admitted, though she'd been certain Janiu and his brothers were the only ones she'd ever seen in Nhanon. It was entirely possible Valamor had charmed one more creature. `` But Gany would.'' \n \n `` Ah yes. Ganymede. Dear little thing... she told Freyr off when she was nine. He wanted so badly to be the husband to a fiery woman such as she. But she loves Valery's son Kimahn! That furry rekkr!'' \n \n `` She's very fond of him, and he of her. \u201d Carefully she edged past a ball, pausing only to look into it. Was it her imagination, or did she see *Sol* itself in those depths? `` Oh my! Father, is this the vault of the universe? Do you watch all of us from here?'' \n \n A great wall moved aside -- bleakly, looking up, she realized it had not been one. Some stone sledge had been laid here, and the hand that held it -- \n \n `` You seem surprised, my daughter. \u201d Endless dark loomed before and above her. \n \n H-His *eye* --! Weaving on her feet, lungs filling with smoke and leathers, Amymone wilted ungracefully to the floor.\n"}

This cold journey has come at a great cost to both of us. Before you continue on to this journey, I must tell you something important. Listen, my boy, carefully. My bag has the record that you need to keep, as well as my own records and notes of the world as we know it... and before the world became as we know it. \n \n In this world of ice and snow... I remember you asking me, after a day of practicing your swordsmanship... \n \n `` Was the world always full of snow and ice?'' \n \n No, my sweet apprentice. It never was full of what we saw for years and miles around. Some praised it, and some hated it. I viewed it with reverence. For if any higher power bestowed us with ice and snow, it was a less harsh punishment than what that higher power wanted to give. Pain and cold could be fought against. \n \n But what came before the cold and pain, this frostland... \n \n In my journey of years past, I wandered long and far. My knowledge has taken me to a former kingdom. My knowledge helped me read what was left of the gates to this kingdom. It was a major outpost of many people long gone. The sign, with the letters that remained, read out `` N w York C ty.'' \n \n The entire city was made of man-stone and steel. Massive towers stood, watching my move.

I searched still, for knowledge of a snowless world. And when I did, I searched further. Until I found the latest record. The record of the winter of now. \n \n The world had bright light each day before the winter of now. And I read of old texts detailing what caused this winter. \n \n A great war, they read. A war so great, each attack of each kingdom destroyed an outpost. And so it continued, the death tolls mounting until nothing was left. \n \n As I read further, I found the works of weather men. Men who could foretell the weather before snow blizzards and ice rain could hit. But they did n't write of either. The attacks raised dust and dirt into the sky. The eternal light was in shadow that we see now. The grey took over. And the snow started to fall. When the world was in flames, the snow came to quench it. \n \n The ice and snow was no longer mystical or beautiful. I knew where it came from, and I knew what it's purpose was.

And in the farthest depths of the Pacific ocean exists portals to the other places; Orion, the great black holes of bigger galaxies, the feeding grounds of many wild and intelligent creatures. The doorways are but a wisp of light on most eons, with a random door opening every so often to expel a monstrous force from the other side. There is usually enough energy dispelled to perpetuate the'ring of fire' that plagues the land around the Pacific.'' \n \n David had been through this sentence at least ten times. A relatively young sentence. Only ten times in the last ten thousand years. The book was small and impossibly flat, and the paper was weathered but thick with words. He would turn the pages and eventually come to the middle, where the book remained, no matter how many times he leafed on through to the back. He could find no author. No title or chapters to discern one subject from the other. There were only words, appearing rapidly in the middle when he blinked. Sometimes he would stop and flip through the pages just to catch up with the words. And every time new information would appear, he would rip a scrap of paper from the back of the blank pages to use as a book mark. But every day, the book mark would disappear, and the page he was on would be lost to centuries of words that appeared in only hours. \n \n Sweat formed in David's eyes, despite the chill wafted through the open window of his small room. He squinted and rubbed the moisture and fatigue from his face. Outside, dead trees and a cloudy sky dominated his vision. The ground was blighted and coursing with old, black blood. It smelled of vomit and refuse. `` So this is Hell,'' he had whispered to himself when he awoke from the decaying bed for the first time, `` This is Hell.'' \n \n The walls were also decaying, peeling off like flayed skin on most of the surface. The floor, however was polished concrete and remained immaculate, no matter how much of a mess he made. There was a small table, that which held the book when he first laid eyes upon it. Everything was the same, always. It was maddening but some semblance of David's sanity remained after soon realizing he held the knowledge of the Universe in his hands. He could not share it with anyone; no one came to visit him, at least not when he was awake. Nor did anyone come to torture him like the stories in his old bible he so tenderly saved throughout the years of his failed marriage. \n \n *What had gone wrong? Was it getting lost in books? Was it because I was forgetting to eat or bathe at times just to get away from his wife? * He had lost his job, his car and had to file bankruptcy just to earn enough to pay the mortgage. His wife stuck around to keep him grounded, motivated more by guilt than love. His health had been failing him but he had impeccable health insurance and long-term disability but even that was no match for death. It came to him, like a thief in the night. There was the feeling of floating, being encumbered and chained, and he was blind for time. When he regained his vision, he could see where claw marks and needles had pierced his arms and legs. There were scars, big and small. He did not remember what it was like to be hungry. \n \n *Perhaps I passed through hell, to get to purgatory. * \n \n But the book, oh the knowledge that keep him attached to his body, it would not relent spilling the secrets of U.S. ambassadors, or the inner workings of interstellar ships.

Then he would wait for the words to appear; proof that life really did exist. \n \n *** \n \n Amanda sat with David as he painstakingly wrote in cursive; words almost too small to decipher.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You are a sociopath in a post apocalyptic environment , describe how you remake society\n","story":"Ambition. \n \n That's what it used to take to change the world. \n \n That's what people said you needed, ambition and a passion to do good. Of course, these same people conveniently never talk about those that had a passion to do good, but were sorely misguided. Someone like Adolf Hitler had both of those things, ambition and passion. In fact, he probably had more ambition than the entirety of the German Population. But that does n't mean he also had benevolent motives. It was obvious why you would need ambition to effect the world, that kind of power is hard to come by, and one needed an enormous amount of determination to stay the course and do their job. \n \n Passion was more of a mystery, however. Of course, this premise was usually combined with `` to do good.'' Which was absolutely ridiculous for the same reason that believing that good always prevailed was ridiculous. What role could passion possibly play in changing the world? They would often say that if one was passionate about something, they would never stop until they attained perfection in the area they were passionate about. That was the excuse that was used. If you did n't have passion you could n't attain perfection. It was something of an unwritten rule. A rule designed to keep the apathetic from realizing how much power they had. \n \n One thing ca n't end the world. Nuclear war seems like it would, an incredibly lethal virus appears plausible, a giant meteor on par with what is theorized to have killed the dinosaurs is a favorite among many. But ultimately, no one cataclysmic event can destroy the civilization we've spent thousands of years cultivating. This theory was of course proven true when the world ended from a nuclear war, coupled with the most destructive bio weapon the world had ever seen. Society deteriorated, but it took a while. Not for me, since birth I always saw society in a constant state of deterioration. It took the others much longer to break their moral and ethical codes, which was something I'd been doing for years. I suppose, logically, sociopaths are the most likely to survive any sort of apocalyptic event. They are n't impeded by the same emotions that the others are. \n \n The first nuclear warhead was fired by Russia which landed practically in the center of New York. NYC was destroyed and the American economy was crippled. The U.S. returned fire, but the guidance system for the missile that was fired had been modified by Russian sleeper cell agents. The missile struck China and a full fledged nuclear war had begun. From there it played out a lot like a movie, the world was completely torn up. Broken. Radiated. Dying. \n \n But, we were dying too slowly. That was someone's thought at least. The deadliest virus ever released was not made by a country, but a small group of Japanese brainiacs. I'm not sure what their motive was, but I have to commend them for their achievement. This virus, dubbed simply `` Point Three'', had a mortality rate of 99.7 %. Hence it's name, contracting the disease meant you only had a zero point three percent chance of surviving. I'm not going to go into detail, but it obliterated almost everyone else who had somehow managed to survive the torrent of nukes being thrown between the world's countries. \n \n I survived both events. There was a day when I knew it was all over. When I knew they had all died. It was that day that I knew I had survived both the bombs and the virus. I'm an atheist, but at that moment I was inclined to believe God had saved me. If he had, he was about to regret his choice, this was my world now. \n \n \n I had ambition, that was for certain. I was going to unite what was left of the world under my supreme rule. But passion? I suppose you could say I was passionate, but it did n't matter anymore. Passion was a marker for achieving perfection, but I'd already done that, I'd survived the two deadliest events in the history of the world. I do n't sleep. I never did. I was walking around the streets of New York City in The United States, shaping the image for my new world. I had heard stories about camps of survivors in these areas. Well camps was n't quite accurate, these shelters consisted of three, maybe four people. I saw two people huddled around a fire that was in a garbage can. Just like the movies. The beginning of my empire. \n \n I unsheathe my knife from around my waist and cut my wrist open. I re-sheathe the knife and strap it to the inside of my pants, hidden from view. I pour the blood from the cut on my wrist into my hand, which forms a little pool. I spread the red liquid onto my other arm, my neck, and the rest on my shirt. As I approach closer to the figures I see that one has a scraggly, black beard and is wearing a black beanie. He's about 5' 10'' and his face looks like it was carved out of stone. Even still, it's obvious that he's been scarred by what's happened in the world in the past years. I'll make that pain work for me. The other man is much smaller in stature, and devoid of facial hair. He is shivering, a lot. I draw nearer, and begin to limp, favoring my right leg. \n \n Once I'm within about 10 yards both men see me. They do n't move, they just watch me. I close the distance between us. I turn my eyes to them, tearful. \n \n `` Have you seen them!? My god, have they been here!?'' I shout, my voice echoing throughout the empty streets. \n \n The smaller man jumps back when he hears the volume of my questions. The larger man with the beard leans close to me. \n \n `` Who are talking to about? Who are you?'' He says calmly, sizing me up. \n \n Both men are unarmed, god this would be so much easier if my mission were to just kill them. But it's not. My motives are much grander. The smaller man recovers from his shock and walks up to me. I turn to them both. \n \n `` My name is Gray. Have you seen the men wearing the black coats, with the guns? Have they hurt you?'' I say to both men, doing my best to sound panicked. \n \n They turn to each other quickly, clearly worried. Panic incited successfully. I look over my shoulder, acting paranoid. I turn around to see both men staring exactly where I just was. This is going to be even easier than I could've hoped. \n \n `` I'm Dean.'' Says the bearded man. \n \n `` And I'm Melvin, but you can call me Mel.'' Chimes in the smaller man. His voice is high-pitched, but firm. \n \n `` What about men with black coats? Are you saying there are people left? Not only that, but you're saying they're dangerous, they're trying to hurt people?'' The larger man asks, he seems very worried. Good, that's what I want. \n \n I start to talk, `` I'm saying th...'' I take my hand from my stomach and reveal the blood. I stumble and fall over. Both men are too shocked to even attempt catching me as I fall. I lay on the ground and feign agonizing pain. \n \n `` Oh shit you need medical help, fast!'' Says Mel, he sounds urgent \n \n `` I'll... I'll be fine.'' I murmur, I strain and slowly sit up. Dean motions for Mel to come join where they think they're out of earshot. \n \n `` Listen,'' says Dean `` I think we should investigate these guys in the black coats.'' \n \n `` Are you fucking crazy? We've survived through two apocalyptic events, and now you want to commit suicide risking your neck for some stranger we met less than three minutes ago?'' \n \n `` The Knights.'' I say, struggling to breathe `` They're called the Black Knights, and I do n't think you should try to find them. They're dangerous. They killed people I know. Good people. My own family died at their hands.'' I knew this was the perfect bait. I had seen Dean holding a picture as I walked up. He was looking at it the way one looks at a photo of a departed family member, or greatly missed friend. I had known there was no way he could pass up a chance to get revenge for himself by pretending to do it for someone else. \n \n `` Well that settles it, we're going.'' Dean's argument is rock solid. We have to find these people to ensure they do n't kill us. It was that simple to him. It was so simple to everyone else. Not to me, I saw the world, even in its damaged state, as the complex puzzle that it was. \n \n Mel starts to speak `` How about I stay here with, uh...'' He turns to me `` Help me out here.'' \n \n `` Gray'' I say. \n \n `` Right'' Mel says `` I'll stay here with Gray, and you can check out the possible death trap.'' \n \n Dean agrees. He walks to their makeshift campsite, inside the building behind us. He returns with a canteen at his waist and a shovel in hand. \n \n `` What're going to use that for?'' I ask incredulous, pointing to the shovel. \n \n He glares at me `` Protection, I figured.'' He hefts the shovel and studies it as if trying to understand why I think it's such a bad idea. \n \n `` No, no, no, here, take this.'' I reach behind me and hand him the knife I had been concealing. He takes it from me and he and Mel exchange glances. \n \n `` That's my only weapon'' I say, trying to ease their tension `` I made sure I got something usable after the Knights killed my family, otherwise I'd think that shovel's a great idea'' \n \n They seem to be slightly more at ease. `` Well, thanks.'' says Dean. \n \n `` Sure'' I reply. `` The last I saw of the Knights they were at the Street Courts at West 4th'' The distance had to be just right, too far and Dean might reconsider his decision and too short and he might be back too early. \n \n `` Okay, I'll be back in a flash'' And he was gone, disappearing around the street corner. \n \n Mel, came and sat next to me, not speaking. He looked deeply worried. Concerned about his friend's safety no doubt. Well, I'd accomplished my first task: creating a common enemy. I reached into my boot and grasped the gun, a Walther PPK, I had hidden there. Now the only thing I had to do was make the enemy real. \n \n I turned to Mel and smiled. I drew the gun and leveled it at his chest. \n \n Ah, the beginning of a new era.\n"}

A group of imperial scouts on horses was getting closer. \n \n `` Alright, Kolsciek you stay with the prisoner. Wallace, Kamarow and M\u00fcller get on the roof and aim for the officers. The rest of us gets to cover next to the road.'' \n \n Kolsciek dragged Flyssa behind a large chunk of rubble. The other soldiers also hid behind walls and rocks. \n \n `` Let them get a little bit closer so they dont have a chance to escape and warn the others. Steady! Hold! Hooold! And Fire!!!!'' \n \n The elders activated their weapons. The noise was deafening as their weapons started to spit fire. \n \n After just a few seconds it was over. Every rider and their horses were dead. Riddled with holes or completely torn apart. Flyssa never expected the elders to be so powerful. 10 soldiers dealing with 50 imperial scouts in seconds. If she could convince them to lend them some of their technology the elves would surely have no problem dealing with the imperials. \n \n The colonel to 2 cups that were connected with a grip to his ear and started speaking. \n \n `` HQ, this is Bravo 1 over.'' \n \n A voice came out of the upper cup \n \n `` This is HQ, go ahead'' \n \n `` We have repelled a attack from the invaders in sector 23. We also spotted a large invader army on the hill east of us. Probably several thousands of them. Requesting CAS over.'' \n \n `` Bravo 1, Bulldog 1-1 and 1-2 are on their way. ETA 5 minutes, over'' \n \n `` Whats CAS?'' \n \n `` Something you filthy aliens wont like. You thought you could deceive us with your lies? We know your kind and wont fall for these tricks.'' \n \n `` What tricks? I really mean no harm and I havent done anything to y..'' \n \n The colonel pulled out a knife and pushed it against her throat. Flyssa was close to tears. \n \n `` Why are you doing this to me?'' \n \n `` Why? I will tell you why. When those gates opened disasters wrecked havoc in the entire world. Earthquakes, huge storms and tsunamies everywhere. Entire cities got swallowed by the earth. And then you send us plagues and monstrosities to finish us off. You murdered billions of us! But we survived, even if we had to give up almost an entire continent. Now we will reclaim what is ours and wipe out every last one of you filthy aliens!!! \n \n A strange sound could be heard from the distance. \n \n `` Looks like the cavalry is here boys'' \n \n `` Bravo 1 this is Bulldog 1-1, do you read me?'' \n \n The colonel picked up the strange cups again. \n \n `` Bulldog 1-1 here is Bravo 1, the target is the enemy army on the hill. We will mark the target with a laser, over. Sato, mark the target!'' \n \n Flyssa could see 2 strange large birds in the distance flying faster than anything she has ever saw. \n \n `` Bravo 1 we got your target, coming in for gunrun.'' \n \n The two bird were flying lower when suddenly the entire hill bursted and got covered in a thick smokecloud. Then she heard a BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT, like the roar of a monster. The two bird were coming back around and repeated this unholy spectacle several times. \n \n When the smoke finally disappeared there was nobody alive left on \n the hill. \n \n `` See this? This is how we will send you back to hell. Kolsciek put a bag on her head and gag her. We will bring her back to HQ.'' \n \n Flyssa tried to resist but the soldier still forced a piece of cloth into her moth and put a blag clothbag on her head. \n \n The colonel grinned. \n \n `` Maybe some watersports will make her sing'' \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

She let out a long draw sigh, with hairs tied up and visible baggy eyes. She has to do one more thing. Gift-wrapping. \n \n She did some quick final touches on her gifts, knowing that her husband would come home pretty late from his job. The family had a bit of problem due to the recession and they're slowly recovering. After all, deep in debts was n't going to help the family's bills. At least father has got another job. \n \n Mother stuffed all of the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly the light went off. Lights randomly going off is of no stranger to the mother, it happens quite often. She looked underneath the Christmas tree, past by the gifts. Reached her arms out, then at the tip of her middle finger, just... getting....there \n \n *click* \n \n Mother leaned back with legs crossed, knackered. The back of her neck stood up, she turned by instinct and Santa Claus grinned in darkness. Santa silently comes forward revealing his whole face, Christmas lights illuminates his face, a scar slashing from left eye down to left check. His eyes are somewhat startling - jet black pupils and strange iris that looked dark red joined by small features of striking orange colours. He looked down on mother who is clearly confused, whether to be scared or amused, she does n't know how to react. \n \n `` I see.'' Santa said, with deep coarse voice `` You have been busy, Leah.'' Santa keeps on catching his breath at every turn of his phrase. `` You see,'' With the help of his dusky red walking stick, he slumps down onto the sofa next to Leah, `` You are confused. You think you are imaging things. You are most definitely not insane.'' \n \n `` Wh-what? How am-, wait wait- I'm confused. Who the hell are you and how did you get into my house?'' \n \n `` Did you not hear about that fairytale everyone that has told you about? Mmm? No?'' Santa chuckles. \n \n `` You're THE Santa Claus? Literally THE Santa Claus?'' Santa grinned and nodded as Leah keeps asking for the sake of her sanity. \n \n `` Now, to the point.'' He gazed deep into her soul. `` You have done something wrong.'' \n \n `` What do you mean I've done something wrong? I've done nothing wrong other than stealing bunch of pens at school!'' \n \n `` No. What I am talking about is your childhood.'' Santa continued to stare into the wells of her soul. His point of focus drifts off from her eyes into the corridor consumed by the darkness. \n \n `` I do n't remember anything when I was a child! I've got three sisters!'' At this point, Leah senses Santa's aura of terror and in turn, Leah starts to feel a bit disturbed. \n \n `` Once upon a time,'' Santa catches his breath again, `` There was a little girl called Leah. She had huge jealously. Especially towards her sisters. Leah was the middle child of the family. Leah's mother decided to have another baby.'' At this point, Leah does n't remember any of this. Santa on the other hand, is trying to catch his breath. \n \n `` When that baby was born, all of the family's attention diverted to baby, not Leah or any of Leah's sisters for that matter. Leah grew with jealousy and hate as months goes by. One night, she had enough of it. Leah went into her father's shed and grabbed a wire that was used to set rabbit traps.'' Santa ruffled through his pockets, then a wire out of his pocket and passes it to Leah `` And Leah with extreme hate and jealousy, strangled her sister, who only was a baby.'' Santa looked back at Leah with deep gaze. \n \n `` On Christmas Eve.'' \n \n Silence. \n \n `` But I do n't remember any of this. Maybe you've got the wrong person?'' \n \n Santa grins with hint of mischief `` It is you and you do not remember it. Ask your parents.'' He catches his breath once again and stood up. `` I have to get moving now. There are a lot of delivery to be done tonight! Many dreams to fulfill! Oh and you can keep that.'' Santa winks. \n \n Suddenly there goes a bang with flash. It resumed all electricity back to what they were doing. \n \n Her baby burst out wailing as she races it upstairs towards her baby's room. As she got nearer and nearer to her baby, it got quieter and quieter then to a complete silence. \n \n She gasped, trying to hold back the tears as she felt a lump in her throat. Her big fat bubbly-chubby baby had red marks around his neck. \n \n Lifeless.\n"}

( Comedic )\n","story":"Field Diary of Dr. James Bancroft \n \n **Date: ** 12th of March, 2284 \n \n **Location: ** Sewers of New York City \n \n When I set out on this journey, I was wholly unsure of what I would find. Mayhaps there was some remnant of American society that survived the destruction. Perhaps there were would be evidence of the local ecosystem recovering from the fallout. Or, the Holy Grail for field researchers: cattle that have developed a resistance to radioactivity. \n \n I sojourned into the sewers under the assumption that maybe it provided some degree of protection when the bombs fell. Miraculously, the lights were still operational. \n \n My theories were proved correct. Curious mushrooms and other vegetation had grown unchecked in the gloom and moisture. They gave off a heady, intoxicating aroma. After collecting a few samples, I decided to cover my face and venture deeper in. \n \n After a certain point, the lights became more uncertain, and were prone to flickering. The only sounds were my footsteps, and the occasional crackle of electricity and water dripping. Empty pizza boxes littered the floor. \n \n I stopped to examine a peculiarly large spore, and for half a second, I heard footsteps. My heart leaped into my throat. I spun around, my hand going to my machete, but there was nothing but shadows behind me. \n \n I slowly turned around, and noticed something skitter behind a pile of debris. The rasp of my machete being drawn from its scabbard seemed deafening. I meekly inched forward. `` Who goes?'' I called out. \n \n No answer. \n \n With shaking hands, I probed the pile of garbage with the end of my weapon. A rusty can rolled down the hill, and out popped a rat the size of a bread loaf. It squeaked, and scurried between my legs. I breathed a sigh of relief, and watched it scamper away. \n \n When I turned, I found myself face-to-face with what I can only describe as a monstrous turtle. It was the size of a man, and stood like one. It wore an orange sock with holes cut out for its blood-shot eyes. \n \n `` Cowabunga, dude,'' it said. \n\n"}

Where's the rest of the Avengers? Oh, *ri-iiighhhttt*, you ATE them!'' Then followed the muffled guffaws and cruel jeers from the visitors within earshot. Sandrea felt the tears well up in her eyes. She took a deep breath, steeled herself, and forced a smile. \n \n `` Do n't pay them no mind, Drea,'' Margaux said, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder. Margaux made for a perfect Black Cat. The leather catsuit accentuated her hips and the corset pushed out her cleavage. \n \n `` I'm alright, Margaux,'' Sandrea sniffed. `` Promise.'' \n \n For a moment, she thought she would hold, but then, it all proved too much, after all. Sandrea turned and waddled a brisk pace, wading through the crowds of cosplayers and onlookers. `` Excuse me, excuse me,'' she mumbled, keeping her eyes on the floor. She made a beeline for the ladies' room. God knows she'd seen enough of it since the morning, until she finally got the courage to step out of the stalls with encouragement from Margaux. \n \n `` It'll be all right, Drea dear,'' Margaux had promised. `` This is cosplay! We can be whoever we want. Do n't let them tell you any different!'' \n \n Easy for Margaux to say, with her perfectly shaped body. \n \n A Black Canary, a Zatanna, and a Phantom Lady were leaving the bathroom just as she entered. She caught a glimpse of fishnets, heels, and capes as they sashayed out the door. And she also heard the F-word, too: `` Fat.'' The giggles were clear even through the closed door. \n \n The main event was starting, and so she had the bathroom to herself. The long row of washstand mirrors reflected her image back to her. The scarlet headdress was too small for her round face and the sides bit into her full cheeks. Her ample breasts threatened to spill out of the red one-piece bathing suit that stood for the Scarlet Witch's bodice -- if only they did n't look like big lumps of dough. Layers of fat rolled up her elbows where the opera gloves ended. The flesh-colored unitard barely kept her pot belly from jiggling as she breathed. \n \n `` I should n't have come,'' she said, unfastening the chin strap of the head dress. \n \n For a brief moment, there was a bright light and Sandrea felt faint momentarily. Outside there was a roar like a wave. She heard screams and whoops, so clear even through the muffled door. She felt the convention hall shake as a growing rumble came from the main floor. What was all the commotion? Ah, the main event, of course. Ashley and Alodia, their perfect elfin bodies. \n \n Sandrea sighed. She should n't have come but... why should n't she? Was n't this the whole promise of cosplay? That you could dress up as anyone you wanted, and they would n't laugh at you? That they'd accept you? \n \n Sandrea felt the rising bitterness. Instead of pushing it down, as she always did, she let it out. Just a little. \n \n `` I wish they were all dead,'' she whispered.\n"}

Not ever being quite able to learn the human languages , it sort of spewed out random vocals in an attempt to imitate us and fit in . He unknowingly became the President of the US and is now unknowingly giving a speech .\n","story":"Sizz'ag'aar could feel his swim bladder pulsing with agitation at the oppressively warming, blindingly bright emissions of the lights in front of him. It was never a pleasant sensation, but he had become used to it with the passage of time and, he supposed, been conditioned to `` perform'' for the humans when they presented him with the lights. \n \n He was still puzzled by the lights. For the last several orbits of this world around it's host star, the humans had insisted on shining them upon him, practically every time he went anywhere and attempted to replicate their speech sounds. Back on the homeworld, bright light was an indicator of a deadly solar eruption, a distressingly common occurrence on Klethoom. Here, though, there was no such negative connotation to the lights. The very first time he had thought it was a hostile gesture, that he had been discovered and that they were going to incinerate him. But it had not been long before he realized that this was just another barbaric practice the humans inflicted upon one another. Certainly not all of the humans merited having the lights shined down on them, but many humans, especially those deemed important, seemed to have to endure it. He took it as an indicator of his skill as an impostor that he seemed to have worked his way into a position where the humans saw him as light-worthy, though he was rather unhappy with the frequency with which they insisted he be illuminated. \n \n The human standing under the text-screen, next to the large black lens-box, gestured at him in sequence with his human digits - first all five of the ugly, unwebbed fingers, then four, than three, until there were no fingers left. This was one of many unspoken indicators he had picked up during his many orbits living amongst this world's natives, and he knew it was time for him to begin imitating the humans' speech sounds. \n \n `` I want to thank you all for coming today. I particularly want to thank our Secretary of Education for traveling with me...'' \n \n If he had been asked by a fellow Klethoomian, Sizz'ag'aar would have freely admitted he had never had much of a talent for xeno-linguistics - especially with a species whose speech anatomy was a foreign as these humans'. Despite having spent the majority of his adult lifespan on this arid, thin atmosphered rock, he had never fully picked up any of the various human dialects here. He did consider himself a talented mimic, however, and that was how he had survived those first few terrifying years here. Repeating back the alien phonemes to those humans who confronted him with their speech, occasionally shaking his head up and down or to the side at random whenever simple repetition did n't appear to suffice. \n \n The humans were smacking their hands against each other now, something that seemed to happen a lot whenever he spoke, perhaps more frequently even then the lights being shined upon him. He waited for them to finish their inexplicable rituals before resuming his oratory. \n \n `` I want to thank the mothers and dads who are here. Thank you for coming. You, too, are teachers. The best education starts at home, by loving your children with all your heart and all your soul. I want to thank the students who are here. Thanks for letting me come by and visit with you...'' \n \n Through trial and error, he had learned how to recombine excerpts of human speech in ways that the humans found more convincing. In the beginning, there had been much confusion, but he could usually play things off by emitting the bark-like laughter the humans so frequently emitted. Sizz'ag'aar supposed the humans did n't take him for a very *coherent* human, but the fact that he was able to pass for a human at all was victory enough in his book. It was n't a terribly fulfilling existence, he supposed, always being babbled at and led around with no comprehension of what was going on, but he was surviving on a hostile alien planet far from home, and that was what really mattered. \n \n He bared his teeth. That was perhaps one of the most important parts of pretending to be one of these humans. Frequently baring one's teeth. \n \n `` But most of all, I want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come and share some thoughts. It is very important for our youngsters to understand history, the history of our country, the ideals that make our country strong. This morning at the Rose Garden I kicked off a national initiative, and I'm going to describe some of what we're going to do to make sure that we teach more history to our children...'' \n \n It had been many, many orbits before he had cracked the code of the human glyphs. They were n't intuitive, conveying only primitive phonetic information rather than abstract concepts, but at least he could finally recite the matching sounds for each combination of signs. It was an invaluable skill to have acquired, as now the humans would present him with sounds he need to recite, even if he did n't understand the meaning of any of it. \n \n `` Our children are growing up in a difficult time for America, because they see on their TV screens the fact that America is now a battlefield. When we were kids, a lot of us were kids, growing up, oceans separated us from danger. We were confident in our ability to resist evil because evil could never make it to our shore, unless it was created internally. But now we've entered a new period where we're vulnerable. It's tough for our children to comprehend that, I know. \n \n But you've got to understand why we're vulnerable, and that is because there are people in the world that hate the fact that we love freedom. People can not stand the fact that your great nation not only allows, but encourages people to worship an almighty God in any way they want to. We welcome that in America...'' \n \n The humans burst into their spastic hand smacking again. Not for the first time he wondered at the significance of the gibberish he was spouting, whether any of it was of significant import... He found it difficult to view the humans as equals, but in his own way he cared for them, and wished that he could converse with them. He had long given up hope of being rediscovered by a Klethoom. This world's primitive bipeds had nothing of value to offer his people, and the world itself was unpleasantly dry and thin of atmosphere. His people would send no follow-up expedition. This world which he had been abandoned upon was his only home, and these aliens... they were his only companionship. \n \n `` You've got to understand there are some in this world that simply do not adhere to the ideals we believe in...'' \n \n He thought of the first human he had ever met, the human whose outward form he now wore. It had been dead, smashed up against one of this planet's towering, woody flora in a primitive four-wheel-locomotive device. He knew nothing of this human's life or death, only that in tasting his genetic material for the camouflaging process, its blood had contained an unusually high proportion of ethyl alcohol. At first he had thought it was just a curious part of their alien biochemistry, but over the orbits had since realized that ethyl alcohol was as toxic to the humans as to Klethoomians. \n \n For the most part, Sizz'ag'aar did n't like dwelling on negative emotions. But he could n't help feeling a deep-seated sense of loneliness, every bit as oppressive as the bright light the humans placed upon him. This human whose form he had assumed... he had chanced upon him, treating him as a convenient disguise to assume while awaiting rescue from Klethoom. He had never expected to encounter the alien's family... to be embraced by them, and spoken to by them, and loved by them. \n \n `` There's a lot of talk about Iraq on our TV screens, and there should be, because we're trying to figure out how best to make the world a peaceful place.'' \n \n He was not their kin, and short of molting this disguise, he had no way of even conveying that to them. He fervently wished, if there was just *one* human he could converse meaningfully with, it was this disguise's forebear. They had spoken many times before, of course, but never with any comprehension on Sizz'ag'aar's part. Parents did not maintain such extended contact with their offspring on Klethoom, but this was one practice which he thought these humans perhaps had gotten right. He was certain there was much wisdom he could learn from this body's genetic sire; from what he gathered, that one had spent much time speaking under the lights as well. \n \n Sizz'ag'aar felt his eyes, his true, Klethoomian eyes, watering under his disguise. Nictitating membranes blinked shut and then open, and his vision was cloudy, making it hard for him to read the humans' text screen. That was always problematic, as it mean he had to improvise until he was able to return to the human-written script - the latter of course held no more meaning to him than the former, but he suspected that no matter how subtle the distinction was, the humans were able to pick up on it. \n \n `` There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you ca n't get fooled again.'' \n \n Eh, close enough.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The hero beats the villain by stooping even lower .\n","story":"Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall. Let? He smirked. By let, is is of course meant that Mozzie did n't resist being shoved into the wall. With his hands bound before him and his body bruised and burnt from the torture, let was a very subjective word. So, Mozzie let himself be shoved into the wall. Mozzie let Haddock shove him toward the hole he'd blown in the back of the citadel. Mozzie even let him slam the butt of his rifle into his kidney when Mozzie did n't move fast enough. \n \n Grave robbing was n't really Mozzie's thing. He liked mysteries and liked being the one to solve them. When Haddock first came to him with the spear haft, the engravings upon it had n't meant much, but when Haddock inferred that that the engravings were part of a map a conquistador had made after leaving El Dorado, Mozzie could n't resist. \n \n He'd scanned it, projected it, stretched it out into two dimensional print outs, tested the metal of the spear head, identified the wood in the haft, compared the inscriptions, and hit up Spain for the opportunity to search for the spear section in their historical records. After all that, his break came from a Redditor who's father had once worked security for a museum in Chicago. And thanks to that tip, Mozzie was able to locate the rest of the spear and even the helm that completed the map and provided the key. \n \n `` Move.'' Haddock snapped, jabbing the barrel of his rifle into the fatty part of Mozzie's thigh. \n \n `` I-I am.'' Mozzie called back. The place is full of spider webs and the damn floor is uneven. \n \n `` I... said move.'' Haddock growled, jabbing him again. \n \n `` Dammit, if I twist my ankle or break my fucking leg, then you're going to have to carry me through this shitty place to unlock the door. So, let me pick my way on my own and just follow me. I'm bound and bruised and beaten. What the fuck. Just stop jabbing me.'' Mozzie could n't really see Haddock's face, but the glass eye in his right socket twinkled with unholy light. \n \n Haddock wiped his brow with a handkerchief, grunted, then responded to Mozzie's reasonable sounding rant by firing a shot into the tunnel floor right between Mozzie's feet. Mozzie swore and went back to trail blazing the spider infested tunnel. He stopped when the floor of the tunnel spread out and the ceiling raised and the corridor went from a barrel vaulted construct to tall rectangular chamber. \n \n Mozzie stopped and shined his light upon the floor. They had glyphs etched into them. \n \n `` Move!'' Haddock called. \n \n `` Stop. I think the floor's booby trapped.'' Mozzie reasoned. Haddock squeezed up beside Mozzie and looked at the floor. \n \n `` How?'' Haddock did n't talk much, but when he did, brevity was solemnly embraced. \n \n `` Not sure. I've researched these types of traps before. Some of the panels are, some of them are thin clay plates. Step on the wrong one, and your foot plunges through and trips what ever trigger lies below it. Haddock glared at him. `` Sorry. I do n't know what traps the triggers will set off. There's no way of knowing.'' Haddock grunted and slid back into the tunnel. A moment later one of the local thugs he'd brought was pressed in to the mouth of the tunnel beside me. \n \n `` What want, boss?'' The thug asked. \n \n `` Kill snakes.'' Haddock ordered, catching Mozzie's eye. The thug frowned, but pulled out his machete. He gave the prisoner a quick glance and marched out into the chamber ahead of them. His third step punched through a tile. There was the echoing hiss in the walls, and from above a tiny pebble fell on the henchmen's head and bounced off. He looked up just in time to catch the three inch spear in the small of his throat. It slammed to a stop about a foot from the floor, impaling the man who hung suspended on the spike. \n \n `` Go.'' Haddock ordered. As they moved forward, Haddock would probe the tiles with the end of his rifle. Sometimes the tiles would break away and nothing happened, and sometimes they'd break away and trip the trigger and let another pole slam down before them. By the time they reached the far side of the corridor, a safe path had been found and marked for their return. \n \n Mozzie was made to wait while the rest of the henchmen made their way across. Mozzie filled that time by studying the next corridor. It was taller and narrower, but just as dark and there were glyphs on the walls like those on the floor. The floor in the corridor was tiled much like the chamber had been. The only difference he saw was the glyphs engraved on these floor tiles were all the same and, he recognized them. \n \n `` What of these?'' Haddock asked. \n \n `` They warn the proud man to be humble.'' Mozzie replied. `` A psalm perhaps.'' Mozzie noticed the holes near the tiles in the wall and noticed their height from the ground. \n \n `` Trap?'' Haddock probed at one of the tiles, it did nothing. \n \n `` Maybe. Perhaps they seek to make us comfortable with the uniform warning on all the tiles. I'll keep watch on the floor to see if any of them change. You do the same with the tiles on the wall. If you see a change in any of the glyphs let me know. Haddock's reply was another grunt and a prod from the rifle barrel. \n \n Mozzie moved forward, cringing in fear that his play would be discovered, but Haddock came in proud like his henchmen and kept his one good eye on the tiles on the wall. Half way down the corridor, a tile tilts under Mozzie's foot and the sound of a click was the only warning before the spikes slammed out from the sides of the tunnel all at heart and head's height. Haddock weakly struggled as he was pierced from both sides. The many of the henchmen cried out, but some did n't. One of them in the back had stooped down just a moment before the blades slid out and in his panic to escape the trap, he stumbled back into the chamber and promptly stepped through a clay tile and was impaled as the first henchman had been. \n \n Mozzie leaned against the tunnel wall and wept for what he'd done. He suspected what the nature of the trap would be. All he had to say was for them to keep low and they would all make it through safely. He'd seen Haddock kill men before, and despite his callous disregard for life, he'd always made it quick and painless. Mozzie was a scholar. He was the adventuring kind. He was n't fighter. He was n't a soldier. He'd never killed before, and if he had, he would have chosen to make it quick and painless. The men were still struggling on the ends of the barbs and Haddock's one good eyes slowly swiveled down like a damning accusation and came to rest on him. \n \n `` You killed Maria.'' Mozzie said by way of explanation. The light in Haddock's eyes seemed to fade and Mozzie knew he had finally succumb. He looked back at the chamber with the two impaled henchmen and the way out and into the dark ahead. He rose and began stripping the dead men of their gear. He used a confiscated machete to cut his bonds, then with a deep breath and an explosive sigh of surrender, Mozzie moved forward into the dark. Hacking at spider webs with the machete, and clutching a stolen Luger in his other hand to shoot snakes and other animals with. \n \n He never wanted to be a tomb raider, but now that he found himself at the precipice of becoming one, he could n't find the moral strength to leave. He wiped at his brow with the back of his hand and smiled and that was how Mozzie entered the business. He pushed forward wondering if Mozzie Merchant would make a good tomb raiding moniker. He hoped so because that was his name and he had no plans to change it. \n \n `` I should buy a hat.'' He mumbled as the darkness swallowed him up.\n"}

Wrote this while I was `` working'' and left plenty of areas where the readers imagination can take over for what they think happened. Though, I do have some ideas in mind but wanted to keep it short and mysterious. Please enjoy! ** \n \n My alarm is going off, time to wake up. The lights in my windowless room power on to simulate sunlight. Mornings were never my favorite but this one is exciting. Like Christmas morning I \u2019 m excited for what is in store today. It \u2019 s not often brother Michael takes us outside of the dormitory, but he promises something special for the day. \n \n The group of us in building C were picked to go on our retreat second after those in building H. I \u2019 m not sure how they picked who got to go first. In fact, I \u2019 m not sure of a lot of things around here. Not only do the directors hold back information from us, no one speaks. Ever. The clean air is meant for nourishing our inner energies not for frivolous waste like carrying our undeserving voices. \n \n I grab my robe and leave my bunk to proceed to the showers, like any other morning. The line isn \u2019 t too long today, I suppose the others are sleeping in. My memories seem hazier every day but I remember when I was new to the complex. Sleeping in is a luxury you don \u2019 t get on the streets. Uncomfortable containment suits and constantly seeking new shelter leads to an unpleasant life. Some would steal air tanks and sneak inside of garages. The wealthy wouldn \u2019 t take too kindly to this. In fact it became sort of a stain on their otherwise carefree lives. \n \n Shelters were built for vagabonds like myself, but they couldn \u2019 t support us for long. Luckily the directors found us. It feels like life before them was a bad dream. Now look at me. In a shower with warm water raining down from above. Every morning I get to do this. Well I think it \u2019 s morning. I haven \u2019 t been able to keep up with the time. The lights go on so I shower and get to work, and when they go off and I go to bed. I \u2019 m happy. No suit to wear, great food, peace and quiet. I \u2019 ve even stayed out of the hole lately, the directors seem to be pleased with my improved behavior. Heck I don \u2019 t even have a commute to work, it \u2019 s just across the hall! As I look down at myself naked I must admit that I have put on a few pounds, but so goes the life of luxury. This tattoo on the inside of my bicep \u201c V17 \u201d always gave me a bad vibe, couldn \u2019 t quite place when I got it. \n \n Sure luxury is defined in different ways. We don \u2019 t have fancy windows or even mirrors in the bathrooms. But we are alive and nourished. Outside isn \u2019 t much to look at anyway, plant life is scarce outside of the greenhouses. Building C was taught to butcher so that \u2019 s how I spend my days. We don \u2019 t eat much meat ourselves but the work is the least we can do for the services we are provided with. We all must contribute. The directors are very kind. \n \n I finish my shower, throw a clean robe on and step outside to see Brother Michael standing there. The group is all ready. Today is the day. \n \n We venture down the hall, longer than I remember first coming to the complex through. I wonder if this will be a long trip as my muscles are used to my new found life of relaxation. Brother Michael stops us in a room full of suits, it \u2019 s really happening. I can \u2019 t get my gear on fast enough. The ventilation turns on as the room seals before opening to the outside. \n \n The front door opens right on cue as we finish suiting up. We file out of the building looking like a bunch of spacemen. I turn to look back at the building as the door shuts behind us. I can see a group of directors peering out through a window a few floors above. The directors are very kind to allow us some time outside. Some feel undeserving, but the directors are very forgiving of our failures of the past. \n \n We are walking around the side of the complex, I can hear the wind as it blows dust against my helmet. The dust comes in waves and at times I can barely see Brother Michael as he is at the front of the group, so I just follow along behind the person in front of me. There is another building not too far away I think but it \u2019 s hard to see. I suppose this is where the directors have something special to show us. \n \n The walk becomes arduous. My bones feel weak, I am not looking forward to the walk back. The building is not far now though so my will keeps me going. What a kind surprise the directors have assembled for us. \n \n The building is strange, there are open windows in the front and a larger building attached to the back. We walk through the front and the room is rather baron. There \u2019 s a few push carts but nothing else. Brother Michael puts his hands above his head then folds them and looks down. We all look down as well so as to follow his cue. After a moment I glance up to see if we are all still looking down. I get a clear look at one of the push carts and notice it has a dark stain down the side. It must be recent as it looks like whatever stained it wiped some of the dust away off of part of a logo painted on it. I \u2019 m now looking intently at it trying to make out what it says. I \u2019 ve seen this logo but I can \u2019 t quite place where. Suddenly I realize and my heart sinks. My breath has escaped me. \n \n I \u2019 ve seen this logo at work. \n \n I look up at Brother Michael. He presses a button on the wall and at once all our helmets spring open, except Brother Michael \u2019 s. I hold my breath as long as I can, the air is not safe I know it. My eyes blur as I look around panicked. Some fall to their knees and accept their fate, others struggle. Blood is leaking from mouths and eyes, I gasp. I \u2019 m filled with this toxic air and finally succumb and fall to my knees then to my side. The others have all fallen still, but I \u2019 m breathing heavily lying on the floor. \n \n Brother Michael walks over to me, suit still completely closed. He kneels in front of me and looks me right in the eyes. I look around and see men in suits emerge, putting the others \u2019 motionless bodies on the push carts. I look back at Brother Michael. He smiles, tilts his head, and speaks for the first time, \u201c It worked \u201d. I \u2019 m teary eyed from the shock of his voice. The light above shines just right that I see my own reflection in his helmet. I realize now that I have forgotten what I look like. But I can see it now, plain as day: \n \n I look just like Brother Michael. \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

You just killed yourself and someone is chasing you , but it 's not the cops .\n","story":"I pressed my back against the gray stone, the cold touch sending shivers down my spine. I could see Charon, his ferryboat heavily guarded by a dozen cops as he waited on the bank of the River Styx. There was the Underworld, just a couple hundred yards away. I just had to distract the cops for a moment and then I could convince Charon to take me across. I rubbed my lucky golden dollar; more than enough to pay the toll. All of a sudden, my breath caught in my throat as my pursuers rushed past my hiding place. \n \n *What the fuck*... I thought to myself. *Those are n't cops*. None of them were in uniform and all seemed vaguely familiar. It was supposed to be cops after me. At least that's what all the Returned had said. If you committed suicide, they would set out after you the moment they found your body. I had taken care to choose a desolate location, far off from the frequented roads, but some Girl Scouts must have stumbled across my body or something. *Fucking amateur*, I scolded myself, noting that I should have asked Siri how to best hide a body. \n \n Except these were n't cops, which seemed to mean that I was n't going to be sent back to Earth. In fact, there were no cops chasing me at all. I probably could have strolled right up to old Charon with my golden dollar on my tongue and been taken right across. I squinted, straining to see through the grayness. *Everything is so damn gray down here*. I could barely tell what color skin my pursuers had... but that shorter guy with the toothbrush mustache seemed so familiar... I racked my brain trying to think of where I had seen him. As he turned, I saw the swastika on his armband. *Why the fuck is Hitler chasing me? * I cursed my luck. The dude had killed a bunch of people and now he wanted to capture me? This did n't make any sense. Nor would it turn out nicely if they caught me. \n \n I scowled and peeked around the stone again. Kanye West? It could be nobody else. He was spouting some nonsense about his greatness and how `` we'' needed me back. *Who the hell is we? Where are the damned cops? * I felt that they would put an immediate end to this nonsense. I mean, Hitler and Kanye hanging out? Them and a half-dozen other people who all seemed vaguely familiar. *Ronald Reagan? * I rubbed my eyes, convinced that I was imagining things. Falling off the tree and landing on my head must have really messed me up. *Some Illuminati level conspiracy shit... * I mumbled to myself before gasping a bit too loudly. One of them turned around towards the sound and I recognized Tupac. I frowned, thinking to myself whether this meant he was dead or alive. Not that it mattered at this point, we were all in some weird in-between at the moment. \n \n *The Illuminati... * I mumbled to myself again. *The Illuminati is after me. * It all made sense. After years spent scouring the depths of the Internet searching for evidence and then posting it on Reddit just to be laughed at, I had finally snapped and ended my life, taking all my work with me. *I must have hit something... Illuminati confirmed, * I said to myself with a chuckle. *And they must fear the cops bringing me back to Earth to confirm it... * \n \n I peeked around the corner, letting out a sigh of relief as I saw that the group had started moving downriver in hopes of finding me. When they were sufficiently far away, I carefully crept out from behind my cover and started crawling towards Charon. He was eyeing me strangely, and I figured I must paint a rather odd figure crawling towards the River Styx when my feet worked perfectly fine. *Quit judging, old man. You probably deal with more crazy people than a celebrity therapist. * The cops starting patting me down before I could open my mouth, making sure I was n't smuggling any of the forbidden items into the afterlife. `` You're going to have to leave your water bottle,'' one of them ordered me. \n \n `` Why? It's just water... Look, I'll even drink it.'' I took a sip to prove myself and he shrugged. \n \n `` Security risk, sorry. Rules are rules. Leave the water and you're free to board.'' \n \n `` ***GOSH***'' I pouted and tossed it on the ground next to the razors and toothpaste that other people had left. Then I remembered I did n't want to go to the afterlife. I had to get back to Earth. `` Guys, I committed suicide. I need to go back to Earth.'' \n \n The cops gave me tired looks before glancing at each other and nodding. Before I could even move, they had clipped a pair of handcuffs around my wrists and forcibly thrown me onto the boat. `` Nice try, buddy. Did you really think you would be the first who wanted to go back? Have a good forever.'' I stared at them in horror as Charon pushed the small boat away from the shore. \n \n `` How are you feeling?'' He asked me as he tenderly helped me up and I looked at him like he was the mentally handicapped spawn of Chris Brown and Kim Kardashian. \n \n `` Dead?'' I half asked and half told him. He nodded, as if this was the expected answer. I heard a yell behind me and turned to see Kanye West leading a charge of Ben Bernanke, Obama and Bill Gates towards me, casting spells as they ran. `` Damn! Imagine being a motherfucking sorcerer!'' I yelled to Charon who ignored me as he dutifully ducked from the spells and rowed the boat a bit more urgently towards the Underworld. I started wondering why they wanted to keep me from crossing now... Dead people were no risk to them, right? \n \n `` If he speaks to God, we're screwed!'' I heard Obama yell to Tupac. *Dammit, * I thought to myself. So God is not the leader of the Illuminati. Back to the drawing board. \n \n ***** \n \n Thanks for reading!

The crimes were too similar.'' \n \n `` That's exactly why you should have stayed out of it.'' \n \n Dexter rubbed his temples and sighed. The guy was n't even a real cop.'Consulting Detective' or whatever the hell that means. Dexter had done his research. Mr. Holmes was all spectacle. Lots of showy if-thens piecing together puzzles from the inside out, making even the most simple of criminals out to be a devious mastermind. It was quite a trick really, convincing the world you're so great not by being great but by elevating those over whom you triumph as to make yourself appear even greater than they. \n \n Still, that did n't explain why he and his little assistant got a first class trip on Air Force One to solve a simple string of killings. It's not as if the goings-on in Miami, Dexter's own activities included, had ever set off any major alarm bells before. There had to be something more to this to get the President himself involved.

Sherlock righted the car and glanced into the rearview mirror. It was very difficult to tell, but eight cars back, one lane over, there was a Ford Escape that appeared to be making deliberate and specific movements in harmony with Sherlock's own maneuvers. Noted. \n \n Sherlock pointed out the car to John, who watched as it passed on by while the crime-solving duo exited onto Alton road. He had to admit, despite their seeming incompetence at first sight, the President's associates were quite adept at spinning a forced meeting into an international collaboration. It did make sense to him after all. With his skill focused mostly on Europe and the occasional foray into Asia, a few criminals were likely to slip through the cracks. \n \n He was n't fond of the gun firmly planted at the back of his head while conversing with the President of the United States, but Sherlock could n't deny being intrigued by the copycat killings of a prolific serial murderer presumed dead in an explosion that obviously was not what it seemed. The body was supposedly unidentifiable, and Sherlock knew better than most that records can be faked and altered, and yet the new killings had subtle differences. The distance between the serrations in the blades used. The drop point being several kilometers down-current from the others. \n \n Perhaps this... James Doakes was evolving.

Every other day of the year he did everything in his power not to think of her, but today was the exception. \n \n She's been dead for a long time, but he still regrets all the times he was cruel to her. After all, she was a wonderful wife and he was a horrible husband. He was a drunk, a gambler, and a cheat, while she was a nurse, a provider, and a saint. \n \n From the moment he carried her across the threshold, their marriage began to sour.

He could n't put his hands on her, for she would surely bruise, sending him straight to prison. He struggled to come up with a clever way to make her death look like an accident.

A very long hall, slim but challenging to get through. They thought it all through. Savannah motioned her partner to the end of the hall, where he silently walked himself through. A loud *meow* was heard throughout the long hallway. Guards popped through doors and saw the cat at the end, chasing it up another flight of stairs. Sparky took cover on a ledge, where he'd not been seen, and dashed back to Savannah, opening the window with the gatling gun ready. The cat hopped up onto her lap as she had launched the gun up toward the roof. On the verge of falling to their death, Savannah pulled the trigger and flashed up toward the top. \n \n Swinging down into the 27th floor, the team found what they'd been looking for. The clock and it's manipulations, what kept the city running. If this clock stopped running, the city stopped running. Gears surrounding them as they inspected the giants gadget, Savannah found the biggest. She threw her explosives, and at the push of a button, time stopped. Moonlight immediately shown through the gap in the tower. \n \n The team smiled and the cat hopped back into Savannah's arm. She triggered the Gatling gun to take her to a safer building. But that was the beginning. With time running, this city was much more than dangerous.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] A simple , classic fairy tale\n","story":"Boys and girls, you know how sometimes your iPad freezes and dad's truck wo n't start? how your friend's mom complains about her drier and your teacher at school growls when she uses her e-mail? \n \n They seem like random happenstance, but they are not. These malfunctions are caused by an ancient invisible species known as the gremlin. They have caused things to go wrong since the beginning of recorded history. They feed on strong negative emotions of human beings, so they break our mechanical devices when we are n't looking. \n \n Many centuries ago, there was a king whose kingdom was known far and wide for the textiles. Their beautiful silks and their gorgeous cashmere was sought after far and wide. These wonderful fabrics were created with a machine made by a mage for his king, it was an advanced piece of machinery that produced non-stop. \n \n One day a gremlin entered the castle on the axle of a wooden cart. the wheel of the cart was broken because of the gremlin, and when the wheel was replaced it would be a while before the gremlin could break it again. A wicked smile crossed the gremlin's face as he looked at the machine. \n \n BAM! BOOM! the machine grinded to a halt as the gremlin broke an axle. The mage asked the king `` shall i repair the damaged axle?'' but the king got furious and told him not to touch it `` the rest of the machine still works, do not fix it!'' and the mage did not. \n \n Many days later the gremlin grew bored and decided to take out another axle. BAM BOOM! another of the fine looms grinded to a halt. the mage came to the king `` i can fix this very quickly sire, both looms can be working again by today'' but the king huffed `` No, we can not stop production, even for a minute. we will just have to run the two remaining looms at twice the speed'' and the mage did so. \n \n The gremlin loved the havoc he was causing, the fast spinning machinery was too much to resist. The gremlin pressed his accursed finger to the axle of both looms and they both broke with an ear shattering snap! The whole machine stops, and the loom is dead quiet. \n \n The mage comes to the king `` the loom has completely broken down! I can fix it sire but it will take me hours!'' The king looks down upon the mage `` It's your machine that broke, it's your fault that this kingdom can not create any textiles. You must be punished, to the dungeon!'' \n \n The mage sits in the dungeon, the city starts to lose money. after a few days food starts to become scarce as the town traded textile for it's food. The king growls about how the horrible mage has doomed the city and threatens anyone who suggests releasing the mage or comes up with a strategy for repairing the loom. Things get more dire as even the king can not find food. \n \n A few weeks later the king has a change of heart, and asks for the mage. The mage, starved and filthy stands before the king `` how.. may i serve you my king?'' \n \n `` mage, i am a fool. My people are starving and we have nothing to trade. If you can fix the looms, i will set you free and make you my thane and promise that in the future i will hear you out'' \n \n The mage nods `` I can fix them sire, i will require a shimmerwood log and nails made by the smith in the next town'' \n \n The king looks aghast `` i spent all the money trying to acquire food for my people, i barely have the money to give you what you need. Can we not use oak from the nearby wood and nails made by my personal blacksmith?'' \n \n The mage shakes his head solemnly `` shimmerwood is the only wood that can take the pressure, and only the smith a town over knows how to make nails that will hold.'' \n \n The king sighs `` i will get you the materials you require, you may rest until they arrive.'' \n \n A few days later, the loom is running at full speed. textiles that are being made are as sought after as ever. The mage shuts down the loom and checks it every night for signs of gremlins. He tough his sons and their sons after them. \n \n So when gremilns break your favorite thing, stay calm and maybe you can fix it. Some things can keep gremlins away, we call it `` maintenance'' which mean `` main tenants'' referring to the mages family who stayed near the loom to look after it's care. \n \n But the main thing is to hold in your anger and listen to those who are trying to help you. Their are many `` mages'' in this world who spend their lives learning how to fix things. They can help you after the gremlins attack, treat them with care. Their advice can prevent you from losing money, and respect.\n"}

He's faking. I went easy on him, all things considered. Couple bruises. `` Besides, you're not that bad looking.'' Couple fractures. `` Well... not *awful* looking..'' He tugs again. \n \n `` Plenty time for more hurt.'' I fetch the bottle I was saving for the bells, and a glass. `` Night's not over yet.'' \n \n `` Year almost is, though.'' He eyes the bottle.

Alone. \n \n `` Well, have you ever..?'' He cocks his head and puts tongue-in-cheek. Subtle. `` Come on, at least give me an *idea* as to what I'm working with, here.'' \n \n Another swig. `` I have a girlfrie-'' A burning one. `` I had a girlfriend.

At the pictures. `` Sorry to hear that..'' \n \n `` Sorry she left, or..?'' \n \n `` Sorry for my chances.'' \n \n I like this guy. Almost a shame I already called the cops. New year's in a cell...

He spotted one of us. \n \n `` She was n't exactly wanting to stick around for hugs.'' \n \n `` You cheat-?'' \n \n He flinches. It's not until I look down that I realize I smashed his glass. My hand is bleeding. Did n't know I was strong enough for that. Not strong enough for most things, these days. \n \n `` Please stop talking. I'd prefer it, if you do n't mind.'' \n \n He nods, slowly and once. \n \n I leave the room and fetch a dustpan and brush. I return, brushing up the glass and trashing it. He has n't moved. Still no cops. New Year. Fucking New Year. \n \n `` Where was I? Right. She left. In a hurry. Killed the cat on her way out, ran it over and did n't stop to-'' My hand is shaking. I pour another drink. `` Did n't stop to take it to the vet's or.. or- or so much as leave a ***fucking note***!'' \n \n Fireworks already. I check the T.V. No bells yet. Is n't that bad luck or something? `` I loved her.. I think. I used to. Maybe it was Ken dying or.. I dunno. Maybe I'm depressed or something. No fun going out, even getting excited at things is..'' Another realization. Night of them, it's turning out. `` I ca n't remember the last time I got excited for something. Not for seeing her, or weekends away or.. even the new Star Wars!'' \n \n `` Jesus.'' He panics. It really just slipped out. Not his fault. \n \n `` Right?'' I pour another drink, spilling a little. Too much. I walk over and place it in his lap, and sit down across from him. `` If you wan na escape, now's your chance. I doubt anyone's fucking coming anyway.'' \n \n He does n't move. He picks up the glass, rolls it in his hands. Downs it. Coughs a lot. `` That is disgusting.'' \n \n Haha. \n \n `` What?'' \n \n Oh. Did n't realize I laughed aloud. I shake my head. `` Nothing, it's just.. I fear it would n't have worked between us anyway. I like my girls to swallow.'' \n \n He laughs at that. I'm not sure why he has n't left, but I do n't care. Right now, I do n't think I'd care if he strangled me with the flimsy fucking plastic and took everything. It would n't matter if I killed him either. Just be something else to deal with. I'd have to hide the body and go about my life. My fucking life. \n \n `` Who's Ken?'' He holds out the glass for a refill. I refill it. \n \n `` Ken.'' Half a bottle left. `` *Was* my friend.'' I stop mid-pour. `` Best friend, I suppose.'' I continue the pour. `` He..uh.. died abroad. Ages away. Funeral was in some shitty church near his hometown. His parents did n't want me there. Bastards.'' I rub my spinning head. `` Ahh.. they did n't even have his body. Did n't have it back for the coffin. I asked why. Some fucking Spaniard answered. Was n't much of a body left,'pparently.'' He gulps. Drinks again, well, more sips. \n \n `` Sorry.'' He seems sincere. I shrug. \n \n `` I mean, things just happen. That's what I found out. That's the lesson in him dying. There is no reason for it, there is no big plan. There is no mystery as to why he died, or why people die all over. Why kids die. Why people live shitty lives and die unfulfilled. Why there are no'soul *mates*' and there's no karma and no reason as to why people die. Other than something or one killed them.'' I try to calm down. I'm not sure it works. He's staring at me. I feel like a fucking actor. But I do n't shut up. \n \n `` I just..'' I'm crying. `` They never tell you you're bad, y'know?

I wo n't die with her in my arms. I wo n't get promoted. Or talk to Ken about how I'm in love and wan na marry her.'' I wipe my eyes. I'm doing that thing where my breathing goes with the tears. Very ugly. `` I thought I was some sorta main character. Because they get the happy endings. But y'know, they never tell you about the bad guys, or the comic relief characters y'know? Or the characters that fucking die halfway through. So what if I'm that. What if I'm not *destined* for anything. No happy ending, no marriage or kids or absolution or..or..'' I'm saying'or' a lot. \n \n `` Not everyone can have a happy ending. That's what they do n't tell you.

I would n't kill people if I could, even if I was angry or sad, like right now.'' \n \n He looks scared. \n \n `` What I mean is, I mean... if God exists he killed my friend. He kills every day. He got me fired and killed my fucking cat! I would n't do that even if I could. Even if there was some mysterious plan to follow. Even if I had to. With a gun to my head, I'd say no and I'd die, and they'd be alive. Instead of..'' I motion to him, then the room. `` All *this*!'' \n \n `` But maybe I got myself fired. I hated that job, maybe that's a blessing. But I loved that fucking cat, man.'' \n \n He laughs. Much more nervously. I suppose I did just talk about killing him. I go to the kitchen and fetch a knife. When I come back he panics. I cut the shitty plastic. Ca n't say I did n't think about it though. \n \n The bells are in a minute. The countdown is soon. \n \n `` Still wan na fuck?'' I wipe my eyes and laugh. \n \n He smiles. `` Well.. now that I'm free..'' He eyes the knife. I laugh. Time to put my money where my nihilistic mouth is, I guess. I hand him the knife. Tilt my head up, open my arms. `` You can take whatever you want. I wo n't even ask you to make it quick, I mean, if you get off on pain or something, at least someone does, y'know?'' I laugh. Pretty sure he thinks I'm crazy. \n \n He grips the knife. The countdown begins. \n \n I kiss him. First time kissing a guy before. He's probably freaking out right now. Huh. It's kinda like a girl's mouth. Little thinner, maybe. More stubble. The kiss ends. The look on his face is... difficult to describe. \n \n `` Happy New Year!'' \n \n I do kinda wan na fuck him.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Civilization has fallen , but brave treasure hunters have heard the legend of Ft. Knox . The automated defenses , however , are still online .\n","story":"`` Why exactly are we doing this?'' Karen asked from the back seat. \n \n Jeff grumbled a reply. \n \n `` I could n't hear you.'' \n \n `` Because we want to get rich,'' replied Jeff, clearly this time. His probing, beady eyes never left the road and his tight grip on the steering wheel had n't lessened in intensity for the last 100 miles. He was ready to swerve off the road at the first sight of an ambush, or an RPG. \n \n The middle-aged woman sitting next to him in the front passenger seat was Merlina. She was fast asleep with a baseball cap covering her long, angular face. The gang never could figure out how Merlina slept in a moving car in the middle of the day with the threat of being blown up hanging over her head. She said car rides bored her. No one inquired further because napping in the car meant she always volunteered to stand guard at night. \n \n Karen stewed in Jeff's answer for a bit. It did n't make any sense to her. After another mile of silence, she spoke again. \n \n `` But how- exactly how do we get rich by stealing gold? Who wants gold in this wasteland?'' \n \n This time, the questions were directed toward the young girl sitting next to Karen in the back seat, reading a severely battered copy of The Road. She put her book down and looked at Karen with the expression of an exasperated adult trying to potty train a toddler. \n \n `` For the last time, Karen, please pay attention during the morning meetings when we discuss these things.'' \n \n `` I did.'' \n \n `` No, you were busy making eggs in the cloud.'' \n \n `` Were n't they great?'' \n \n `` Yes...'' the girl conceded, `` but no one asked you to.'' \n \n `` Well, I'm sorry for trying to make your lives a little better,'' replied Karen in a hurt voice. \n \n The young girl, who everyone called Nuri, backed down a bit. Karen was the only person in the group who could take what looked like bits of canned shit and some leaves and conjure up a meal you could serve at a restaurant. That is, if restaurants were still around. She had been a 3 star chef back in the day, and judging by what she could do even with trash, a very good one. \n \n `` No, we really appreciate what you do, Karen. But the plan meetings are important. My life or your life could depend on what we discuss in them.'' \n \n `` Yeah, I know. I'm sorry,'' said Karen, in a tiny, apologetic tone, her eyes downcast. No one who saw her right now would believe that she had taken down four grown men with only a spatula and a kettle. \n \n Nuri tried to get the conversation back to the original issue. \n \n `` Anyway. The reason we want the gold is that pretty soon, most of the bottle caps will start to disintegrate and people will start looking for a new currency. Groups and tribes will be much bigger by then and people will try to take civilization back to where it was. Since gold is something that is limited in supply and was once valuable, many people will consider bringing it back as a currency. Having our own stockpile at that time will be like having the winning lottery ticket. Do you get it?'' \n \n `` Well, that makes sense, I guess,'' Karen was satiated. She turned back to the cargo hold of the station wagon and tapped on the shoulder of the man sitting there, looking out the rear window for signs of trouble. He looked back. \n \n Gerald had a memorable face. Actually, he had a very plain, pale, forty-something face with some very memorable features. He had a knife wound below his left eye, his lower lip was mostly missing and there was a ghastly scar that started at his ears, crossed his chin and ran all the way down his throat. Jeff called it the devil's beard. The group was sure that this scar was responsible for Gerald being deaf and mute, but did n't know exactly what had caused it because Gerald could only write his name and did n't like being questioned about his past. Everyone had been suspicious about him at first, but that feeling had evaporated when Gerald threw himself between Nuri and a.357 round. \n \n Karen pointed to him and made a circle with the index finger and thumb of her right hand. \n \n `` You okay back there?'' \n \n Gerald smiled and returned to examining the road they had left behind. \n \n `` We're almost here. Get-'' \n \n Before Jeff could finish, something hit the bonnet of the car, throwing up sparks and a second later, the sound of a high caliber sniper shot rang through the air. \n \n Jeff immediately drove the car into the bushes beside the road. The second shot hit the tarmac where the car had been two seconds ago. Everyone waited with bated breath. \n \n After a minute of silence, Merlina spoke first. \n \n `` Are we there yet?'' \n \n -- -- \n \n `` I thought you said it was abandoned,'' Jeff grumbled as he inspected the damage to the hood of his rusty old Toyota. He had grown quite attached to the car. They had been using it for almost a week now. \n \n `` It is. The major was n't lying,'' replied Merlina, who was flat on the ground, eyes glued to her binoculars. \n \n `` How do you know he was n't?'' asked Nuri. \n \n `` Because he was begging me to take the gun out of his mouth.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' \n \n `` So, what,'' it was Karen this time, `` did another group get here before us? Maybe they barricaded themselves in.'' \n \n `` No, that's not it either.'' \n \n `` And why's that?'' Jeff had finished inspecting the car and was n't too happy. \n \n `` Because, if it were Lurkers or Tards, they would've drawn us in closer and hit us with rockets or grenades. That, my friends was a warning shot.'' \n \n Merlina rolled back from the edge of the road to the thicket of trees where the rest of the group were and sat up. \n \n `` And do you know who still fires warning shots in this hell hole?'' \n \n Nuri got it first. \n \n `` Robot turrets?'' \n \n `` Bingo!'' \n \n Gerald nodded knowingly at the word robot. Nuri had been teaching him to lip read and he could now pick up a couple of words in every sentence. \n \n Merlina ran her hand through her close-cropped raven hair. `` I do n't think there's any easy way to get through, unless...'' She turned to Jeff. `` Did we pass any other buildings on the way here?'' \n \n `` Nothing military. There's a farmhouse, half a mile back.'' \n \n A smile pierced Merlina's thin lips. `` That may be our ticket in. These places always have a secret way in and out and I bet that farmhouse is one.'' \n \n Nuri scoffed. `` Come on, Merle, this is n't the Middle Ages. No sane person would compromise the security of such a stronghold with a stupid secret tunnel.'' \n \n Merlina's smile grew larger. `` And that's exactly why it makes sense to build one. Besides,'' she continued, in a more serious tone, `` we definitely ca n't get in this way. These military automated turrets are very smart, have night vision and tons of ammo attached to them. Even in the car we would n't make to even 500 feet from the gate.'' \n \n `` So, that's decided then,'' said Jeff, `` We're going to the farm.'' \n \n -- -- \n \n Nuri pursed her lips. `` I know I bet you two bottle caps, but I have decided not to give them to you.'' \n \n `` Suit yourself, kid,'' said Merlina. \n \n The fivesome was standing in a semicircle, staring at a door. It looked pretty harmless, but there were two very interesting things about it. Number one, it had been completely hidden behind a large dresser. Number two, it was completely metallic with a small button next to it. \n \n Jeff asked what they were all thinking. \n \n `` Is that an elevator?'' \n \n Merlina wordlessly pressed the button. The whir of machinery coming to life wafted up through the wooden floor of the farmhouse they were standing in. The place had been deserted and robbed, but nobody had found the hidden door. \n \n Several seconds later, the door opened silently and revealed that it was indeed a run of the mill elevator. \n \n `` Well, no use wasting time standin' around,'' said Jeff and got in. The others followed. \n \n There was only one button inside as well. Karen pressed it and the metal box started to go down. \n \n `` What if this is a trap?'' mused Karen. `` What if the door opens and we find ourselves face to face with a machine gun?'' \n \n `` Well, then we die,'' replied Merlina. \n \n `` But I still have things to do!'' \n \n `` What things?'' \n \n `` I have important things in my life, Lina,'' said Karen testily, `` For your information, I have a very handsome man waiting for my return.'' \n \n `` Who? Bald Robert? Mr.'I have no idea what foreplay is'?'' \n \n `` Yeah, but how did-? Did you-? When?!'' \n \n `` Last month.'' \n \n `` That lying sack of shit! I'm gon na -'' \n \n The elevator jolted to a halt and the door opened. \n \n On the other side of the door was a machine gun turret, pointed right at them. \n \n -- -- \n \n *Hit the character limit.

The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up, the top two buttons undone, but aside from these concessions the shirt was immaculate; the fabric thick and supple, pressed to perfection, and white as pure snow. It hugged his lithe figure arrogantly. He brought the whiskey glass to his lips without breaking his gaze from the view, sipping at the sharp amber liquid before placing it on the balcony wall. If the sharpness of the whiskey bothered him, it did not show, as he traced a finger absent-mindedly around the rim of the glass. \n \n To the uninformed he was a man enjoying the quiet - perhaps reflecting, perhaps in the slack peace of the nothing zone. \n But the old man watching from the shadow knew better, for the young man had been him, and was him. \n \n His voice was hoarse with age as he spoke from the darkness \n \n \u201c It \u2019 ll all end in flames, boy \u201d. \n \n The younger man whipped around in shock, his reverie broken \n \n \u201c Who \u2019 s there? \u201d \n \n The old man dragged himself forward into the light, his cane scraping on the ground as he moved. \n \n \u201c Who are you?

He picked up his whiskey glass and took a sip. \u201c Fuck off before I hurt you \u201d. \n \n The old man moved forward again, and stood directly behind his younger self. \n \n \u201c You come here to scheme. To plan the takeover. I know, boy, I remember. But how many nights do we spend here, staring at those mountains, wishing for power enough to destroy them with the wave of a hand? How hard do we crave for dominance, to make men debase themselves before us just so they know we are untouchable? How many? And for what? \u201d \n \n If the words affected the younger man he did not show it. \n \n \u201c And be damned it we don \u2019 t get it too. But we miscalculated, boy, we read men wrong. Power comes from the spirit of others, given over to you. You can take it by fear, but you crush the spirits in the process. And you can only crush them for so long before the last flicker of spirit dies out and your power becomes an empty vessel. It \u2019 s doomed, Boy, and it doesn \u2019 t end well - it *didn \u2019 t* end well. \n \n The old man paused, staring at the figure of his youthful self leaning on the balcony. \n \n \u201c Do you hear me, boy? \u201d \n \n The younger man seemed to be nodding in thought. \n \n The old man continued. \n \n \u201c If you want real power, the power to change history, you build their spirits up. You win them over. Then, the power you can draw upon - the reservoir - is deep and unending. \u201d \n \n \u201c Do you hear me, boy? \u201d The old man asked. \n \n He prodded him with his cane. \n \n \u201c Is this getting through to you? \u201d \n \n The young man whipped around and struck the elder with the whiskey glass, knocking him down. His lips where pulled back in a rictus snarl as he climbed atop the old man and descended the whiskey glass again and again. The corners of the crystal glass tore at the leathery face, the weight broke bone and teeth, and sticky acrid blood coated the younger man \u2019 s hands. Aside from grunts of exertion and the dull wet sound of the glass striking flesh, the evening was a silent witness. \n \n The old man \u2019 s shapeless face moaned incoherently, and the young man paused, holding the glass up high. \n \n \u201c You call that power old man? Doing their FUCKING bidding?

Not that it was any different than before I fell ill- but now I was aware of it. I knew that he was waiting for my signal, any signal, to dump his shrew of a girlfriend. Yet I hesitated. I was so worried to tell him how I felt, worried I would lose my best friend. \n \n It was a hot summer day when he asked me to meet him on a stone bench outside of the library because he had something important to tell me. If I'd known what was about to happen, I would have put on waterproof mascara. if I'd known what was about to happen, I would n't have gone. \n \n He was in love with her, you see. The shrew. Had asked her to marry him ( she'd said yes, of course ) and now he wanted me to be his Best Man, well, Best Woman. I wanted to scream, to talk him out of it, but one look at his face and I knew. So I told him yes, smiled and hugged him. Then I went home and cried until my dehydrated body could no longer produce tears. \n \n In their wedding, I was the best Best Woman I could be. I made sure everything went off without a hitch, gave the most epic speech I could manage. Dead inside, but somehow still walking. And I hugged them both and wished them well as they left for their honeymoon. \n \n What else could I do? She made him happy, she was what he wanted. Should you not give your love their every desire, even when seeing them together steals the air from your lungs? \n \n Though he will never know, Harold is my one true love- always has been and always will be.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Every religion has started selling a brand of themed ice-cream . You 're the poor sap who started this cold war .\n","story":"Was I the person that ended the world? Maybe. Or maybe the world was already doomed, and all it needed was a genius entrepreneur to put the final nail in the coffin. I do n't know what one is the truth, but either way I feel somewhat responsible for the dark events of march 11th, soon to be known as... Doomsday. \n \n I used to work at a small ice-cream parlour in downtown Toronto, getting paid near nothing, and not really caring about my shitty job. Across the street from me was a huge cathedral, and every Sunday I would watch everyone leaving service go into the basement, and feed on the assortment of treats and drinks. This place always had a huge supply of the food, but never once did they ever buy my stand's ice-cream. That's when I had the brilliant idea to try and market a new flavour just for the catholic market. \n \n I claimed the ice-cream was made with holy milk, and the cone to be the body of christ. The first Sunday I stood outside with my sign ready, preparing for the new customers, but no one came. I thought the idea was genius, but apparently not. I felt like giving up, and I wish I did. For the next few weeks I advertised the shit out of my new flavour, and after nearly harassing the church goers, I got my first person interested, and it was the brother of the minister. He told me that he loved the idea, and that he would spread the word. \n \n Things were looking up, life was turning around. The next day I had an actual line of customers all wanting the holy cream, and the sacred cone, and it was a Monday. Things only escalated from there, and before I knew it I was on the news, and had over 50 different parlours around the country. \n \n Then the competitors came, flavours claiming theirs was for other religions. Once that started to take off, the actual Vatican made their official ice cream, and then Israel, and then Mecca, and then so on. I was losing business in an industry I created! But I was n't done yet, there was a market that had n't been tapped, Atheists. But what would their flavour be like? It would be dairy free, something to set them apart. \n \n This was actually very successful, until it started getting criticism, and once that happened, every one did. It's like the world finally realized how dumb this ice-cream thing was, but it was too late. The world was now nearly 60 % ice cream controlled. We were at the brink of war, ice creamers versus the whole breeds. The tension was strong, and borders closed. \n \n Then on the night of March 9th the news declared that the ice-cream pope had killed the catholic pope in his sleep. It was a declaration of war, only to be the start of the end. The peace between the flavor factions snapped and there was blood. Canada \u2019 s Bacon Faction gunned down by the Muslim Vanilla \u2019 s, and them by the Chinese Red Bean. This went on for one entire day of global war, until the 11th, when it all ended. Dairy bombs had been set off by the new US Ice-cream government, and soon enough everyone set theirs off, plunging the world into a tasty ice age. \n \n Now there are few of us, and even we are n't safe. Instead of helping each other, the survivors are still fighting for the better flavor. I \u2019 m part of the cherry faction, alliance with the pistachio and mint. The chocolate faction, one of the largest, is attacking our hideout.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] After a world-wide abandonment of faith , the churches are now in power again by keeping people subdued and with communion\n","story":"Jarem \u2019 s hand twitched slightly as he moved forward another step, and a quick but intense ripple of apprehension passed through him. \n \n God Damnit. He thought, annoyed. The feeling was gone as soon as it came, but for that half a second, he had been terrified, a quick flash of dread that seemed to catch him unawares for the moment, as if he was jerked awake and realized he was late for some important event, or had suddenly remembered something he shouldn \u2019 t have forgotten. It was nothing but an inconvenience, and frustrated him more than anything. It didn \u2019 t happen often, and only recently had it been getting harder to ignore, the trepidation lingering a little longer each time. \n What did bother him though was the slight taste of bile that he had begun to be left with; the fact that his body was disturbed on such a deep level in that split second, that in its fight-or-flight moment, almost sent vomit from an empty stomach rushing up and out of him. \n \n Why? Fucking knock it off already, you \u2019 re fine. He thought, addressing his own body. He sucked his cheeks, gathering saliva, and swallowed, trying to wash his throat clean of the taste and sting of his stomach fluids, and tried to focus his thoughts elsewhere. Another hour or so and you can get something to eat. You weren \u2019 t allowed to eat on the mornings of Communion, not beforehand anyways. To do so was saying that the food for the body was more important than the food of the body, the bread of the body of Christ. These mornings were always the longest it seemed, a slow-moving blurry hour of hunger and patience, accompanied by the occasional wave of fear, for Jarem at least. Afterwards though, the day always seemed to turn for the better; he couldn \u2019 t remember the last unpleasant communion day he had. \n \n A small waft of musky perfume tickled his nostrils as he stepped forward again, following the woman in front of him, where the smell no doubt came from. She smelled out of place, and made Jarem curious as to why she seemed that way, and why the smell seemed to bring with it a forgotten experience or memory that was just beyond his recollection \u2013 how smells so often did. The woman wore a simple, loose fitting black dress that spilled down to her feet, which were planted with stern posture, along with a velvet like coat of deep purple, almost black itself. Her hair, tucked neatly under her hat that was just as unfamiliar as the rest of her, only peaked Jarem \u2019 s interest. She was out of dress, out of the ordinary, out of the times it seemed. \n \n Either way, she was a curious island of deep blues and blacks in a shallow sea of tight greys and off-white uniforms that had somehow become the normal attire of everyday life. He followed her as she stepped forward again, and heard a faint metallic rustling as the beads of her rosary brushed up against each other. She was clutching the cross with both hands, her arms relaxed down against her womb, a curiously determined grip on the holy symbol. \n \n He could see the top of the crown now, its thin defined angles of gold wrapping the silver beneath it. It bobbed and turned rhythmically as each new person stepped forward to receive the blessing. It still amazed him how accepted and established the Faith had become since the Overthrow, seventeen years ago. He felt pride in his community, that they were able put aside their contempt and embrace the passive lifestyle of worshipers, realizing that all they are and all the have they owe to the saints of past, as well churches of now, for maintaining the holy practices of peace and adoration. \n \n The Overthrow had tried to collapse all of that. Lasting three and a half years, it had been the most devastating event since the middle east conflicts, and had sent the world into a hate fueled, blood filled frenzy against all religion. Churches, monasteries and places of worship of all kind were brought down by the masses, set to fire with all their history and relics \u2013 and more often than not their pastors, ministers, and clergymen \u2013 left to the flames and smoke inside. \n \n The true origin that great upheaval was still not fully known to Jarem, or most people for that matter, and didn \u2019 t seem to be of anybody \u2019 s interest either. After all, it wasn \u2019 t the cause of it that mattered, it was the result: the peaceful, worry-free life they all now lived. He found it curious that the never wondered at the cause of it all.. \n \n Another step forward and he was bathed in sunlight, pouring down through the huge, seven-meter high windows that lined the cathedral walls. Galaxies of dust floated on unseen currents through the light, pollution that would otherwise be unnoticed if not for those illuminating rays. \n \n The air we breathe is contaminated, yet we do not even see it. We take it in without a second thought, not even caring for what it may carry. A sharp sting, a nail in the back of his head suddenly split his thoughts for a second, sending the bile back up and his fingers into tight balls. Heavy paranoia filled him, and he thought: poisoned. Is the air poisoned? He was almost frantic, there was something he was forgetting, something he needed to remember, or something he was about to realize, that pulled at him as he struggled to maintain composure. He was so afraid, he wasn \u2019 t even sure what he was afraid of, and that just scared him more. \n \n He contemplated turning around and leaving, walking fast before anyone could stop him. He could go lay down somewhere, let his head clear, or get something to eat, perhaps that would help. It wasn \u2019 t possible though, he would be shamed and probably taken into custody for refusing communion, seen as a hostile and potentially dangerous individual to reject the practice that had brought them all peace. He didn \u2019 t want that, he couldn \u2019 t have that, but something primal had been triggered in him, his mind raced without him being able to grasp a thought. He need air, he needed to vomit, to run, to hide, to escape. From what? What \u2019 s wrong with me? What the fuck is happening? His foot began to turn, but just as he was about to make his escape that would prove so foolishly futile, he was there. \n \n Well, he was almost there. Second in the line to be exact. The woman in front of him had just stepped up to the dais, fidgeting with her rosary still, her feet awkwardly shuffling for a few quick moments. She had been looking down since they had begun their procession, but now she lifted her gaze towards the vaulted ceilings above and the cross that hung below them against the back wall. Her eyes glistened with the slightest sign of tears, which seemed odd to Jarem, as nobody was overly devout these days, everybody was just as dutifully pious as the next person. The tears scared him also, as he was still swimming through currents of opposing and disengaged thoughts. Perhaps it was only her unusualness that was scaring him, something he wasn \u2019 t used to. For some reason that didn \u2019 t seem to be it. \n \n As the priest recited the ceremonial verses and slowly brought out the small, yellow wafer, the woman closed her eyes, tiny rivers slowly tracing the lines of a time-worn, grief-ridden face, to collect for a moment under the corner of her jaw, before falling to the floor. \n \n \u201c And with this, the bread of the body of Christ, you are reborn once again, lifted from the blackness of guilt and defiance, submitted to the light of God and given the gift of honest sight. Eat now child, and see the truth that is our lord and savior \u201d \n \n But as the priest lifted the offering to the woman \u2019 s mouth, she suddenly became alive. Her eyes flicked open, shining with what seemed like rage, and her hands moved with such speed that Jarem almost missed the entire event. Her age betrayed her though, and the sharpened cross never found its home inside the priest \u2019 s body, as he almost instinctively, with ease, caught her arm, twisted until the cross fell to the floor with a steel clang, and her arm as well as her voice cracked. Jarem was completely frozen then, though the urge to run was never greater, he couldn \u2019 t however move his body for the life of him, or even hold on to a single thought except: What the fuck is going on? \n \n This thought was more applied to his entire life than the moment currently happening. It was as if he was slowly awaking from a long deep sedation, colors and sounds and sights slowly seeping back into the world and into his mind, trying to regain understanding and a sense of what the fuck really was going on. And as he stood there, unable to move in a crowd of people who seemed to not even notice let alone care for what was happening right in front of them, the woman, on the ground now, clutching her arm and sobbing deeply and mournfully, turned to look at him through eyes of terror and deep sorrow, and the third wave hit him. \n \n This one was in his chest however, not so much his mind, and it all rushed back into him; his thoughts, emotions, memories, his being, drowning him in the overwhelming realization of what had become of it all. His lungs filled to almost bursting as he sucked in the dust filled air, trying to comprehend all that was happening to him, all that had happened to him, to everything. \n Then there were hands on his face, and his eyes suddenly focused on the two staring back at his, and the thin, dry smile that was drawn on the priest \u2019 s face. A face that seemed soft, yet hard beneath, pudding on the surface and cold steel just behind the slit of a smile. \n \n \u201c Jeremiah. I \u2019 m always glad to see you here, so obedient, so committed to our cause. \u201d\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Jesus is sent to earth again , only he lives his life not knowing he is Jesus .\n","story":"Mark lay in his bed staring at the ceiling. He glanced over at the clock anxiously. \n \n 2:12. \n \n Only five minutes had passed since he \u2019 d last checked. He didn \u2019 t know why he kept looking. \n \n He rolled his head around so that he was facing the other side of his bed. His daughter had fallen asleep in the bedside chair, his nine month old grandson in her arms. He reflected on the fact that he wasn \u2019 t going to get to see the boy grow up. That was the one thing that really bothered him. Claire was the only thing he \u2019 d ever had a hand in that was worth a damn, and he was sure she would make a great mother. \n \n It wasn \u2019 t the rhythmic chirp of the heart beat monitor that kept him awake, nor any of the various tubes sticking out of him. He \u2019 d grown used to those annoyances by now. He couldn \u2019 t sleep because he somehow knew that if he did he wouldn \u2019 t wake up. His time was now, and he wanted to spend what little time he had left alone with his thoughts. He didn \u2019 t want his last moments to be dictated by his subconscious. \n \n In reverse chronological order, he skimmed through his life with bittersweet content. He remembered his mildly successful career as a politician; the birth of his grandson; Claire \u2019 s wedding to an honest, affluent man almost deserving of her; his failed career as a writer; his increasingly jaded days as a doctoral candidate in Theology; his slightly more hopeful ones as a Philosophy candidate; his stressful but enjoyable days as a grad student; his time as a wide-eyed undergrad and his fair tale romance with the woman who would become his wife. He noted that he \u2019 d skipped over her death, and didn \u2019 t feel like backtracking just to revisit that tragedy. \n \n Next he reflected on his transformative High School years, and finally his privileged, and by all accounts normal, middle-class, American upbringing. \n \n Where had he gone wrong, he wondered. It wasn \u2019 t that he was entirely dissatisfied with his life. He certainly didn \u2019 t dead the end. But he felt as if he \u2019 d failed in some way. He had so many ideas for the world, so many hopes for it. \n \n He \u2019 d tried to reach people through his writing, but he just hadn \u2019 t been able to command the prose worthy of his content. \n \n He \u2019 d tried to help people by being a public servant, but never amounted to anything more than a low-level congressman from a state with several others competing for the spotlight. \n \n He \u2019 d eventually come to the conclusion that people didn \u2019 t want his help. \n \n He felt his strength leaving him, and glanced at the clock again. \n \n 2:19. \n \n As a good a time as any, he thought. He closed his eyes. \n \n He felt as though he was no longer awake, but knew instantly that he wasn \u2019 t asleep either. He felt lighter. He felt like he was rising. \n \n He looked down and realized that he had left behind all of his worldly inhibitions: all the pain, the doubts, the worries had vanished. \n \n Mark was taken a bit by surprise. He had been agnostic all his life, and had even leaned towards the side of atheism towards the end. He had no idea what to expect next. \n \n He didn \u2019 t feel like he was rising very fast, nor had he been for very long, but suddenly he was there. You \u2019 d figure it would take longer to reach heaven, he thought. \n \n It was just as anyone might have imagined it. Clouds as far as the eye could see, blue sky above, complete pearly gates. \n \n The gates opened and out walked a long haired, bearded man like something out of a New Yorker cartoon. Mark briefly wondered how he hadn \u2019 t seen the man on the other side of gates before they opened, but figured it wasn \u2019 t worth questioning. Things weren \u2019 t required to make sense anymore. \n \n He knew that it was Him, not an angel or a saint. He didn \u2019 t know why, but he knew. \n \n A million thoughts were running through his mind, but one soon rose above the din. \n \n I \u2019 m going to speak first, he thought. I \u2019 m not going to sit here dumbfounded, praying that he \u2019 s the just God armchair philosophers talk about. I \u2019 m going to speak first. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m not a Christian man, or at least I wasn \u2019 t until a few seconds ago, but isn \u2019 t Saint Peter supposed to greet me? Why are you here? \u201d \n \n The man answered plainly, ignoring the Mark \u2019 s smart remark. \n \n \u201c Because you \u2019 re my son. \u201d \n \n Mark knew what he meant instantly, but decided to ignore the feeling. \n \n \u201c Well, yeah, I know, we \u2019 re all your children. I \u2019 ve studied your book, you know. \u201d \n \n \u201c No. You are my only son, my true son. Jesus, if you will, although that was just your mortal name the first time I sent you to earth. \u201d \n \n There was no more denying it. Marks stomach felt heavy. He wondered if perhaps he was just asleep after all, even though he knew he wasn \u2019 t. \n \n \u201c What, what do you mean? How can I be Jesus? How could I not know that? Hell, forget that, how could I be agnostic? \u201d \n \n Mark was pretty sure it was a bad idea to curse in front of God, but reasoned that if he really was Jesus God probably wasn \u2019 t about to send him to Hell. \n \n \u201c I didn \u2019 t want you to know. \u201d Mark was about to ask why, but realized God was about to launch into a monologue. \n \n \u201c People didn \u2019 t take the lessons you taught them to heart last time I sent you down. Your so called apostles skewed your words to the point that they were worthless. It wasn \u2019 t as bad as what they did with mine in what is now the first testament, but it was bad enough. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s worse, they used the authority they derived from the book to amass decadent wealth and power, and routinely violated their own erroneous teachings. \u201d \n \n \u201c But why make me unaware of my own destiny? \u201d Mark interrupted. \u201c If they didn \u2019 t know I was your son, they \u2019 d be even less likely to listen to what I had to say. \u201d \n \n \u201c So it would seem. But I had hoped the opposite would be true. People were starting to listen to holy texts less and less. I had hoped that words from an earthly authority would resonate better with them. \n \n \u201c I didn \u2019 t care that they \u2019 d stopped believing in me. There are plenty of good people out there with no faith at all, and plenty more terrible ones that claim to be devout. I just wanted them to stop killing each other, the planet, and all the other terrible stuff they do, you know? \u201d \n \n The feeling of awe that Mark had felt was fainter now. God was starting to sound less like an all-powerful deity and more like a well-meaning older brother. \n \n \u201c So why not just... \u201d Mark began, but had a feeling God knew what he was going to ask, and that he already knew the answer. \n \n \u201c What, make them love each other? Appear before them myself and scare them into compliance? It \u2019 s not that simple. I \u2019 m not as all-powerful as you people think I am. There are certain rules I have to follow, ones I don \u2019 t quite understand \u201d \n \n Mark thought that was ironic, seeing as humans hadn \u2019 t been around nearly as long as this guy and had figured out most of the rules that govern their world. It was probably an unfair comparison, he realized, seeing as he probably couldn \u2019 t grasp the most basic of the rules this guy had to play by, but ironic nonetheless. \n \n \u201c And even if I could, what good would that do? It would violate human nature, as you guys say. It would defeat the purpose of everything I \u2019 ve done for you guys. \u201d \n \n The phrase human nature got Mark thinking about all the questions of free will and predetermination he \u2019 d spent so long pondering. He also wondered how evolution and\/or intelligent design fit into the picture. He figured it wasn \u2019 t worth asking about right now, and that it wouldn \u2019 t matter anyway. \n \n \u201c That \u2019 s why I sent you down in the first place. More than anything, I wanted the answers to come from a human. More than that, a human that figured them out for themselves. A perfect human, one unlikely to ever come about without my intervention, but human just the same. \n \n \u201c And they did. Everything you ever said, all those papers you wrote, the novels you couldn \u2019 t get published, all the speeches you gave, the bills you introduced, they were all perfect. \n \n \u201c But no one would listen to you. They never do. \u201d \n \n God was clearly too defeated to care enough anymore, but Mark wondered if he \u2019 d ever cried over his creation. \n \n \u201c So what now? \u201d Mark asked. \u201c Do I just chill in heaven with you now? Can I see my wife? What about Abraham Lincoln? \u201d \n \n \u201c No. I \u2019 ve got no idea what I \u2019 m going to do, but certainly not nothing. \u201d \n \n It was a lie. He had something in mind. He just couldn \u2019 t bring himself to say it. Mark knew something was wrong. \n \n \u201c Come on, you \u2019 ve got to have something in mind, \u201d Mark pried. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re right I have one idea. I was considering scrapping the project. \u201d \n \n The cold and unpoetic words were the only ones God could bring himself to say. Anything else and he wouldn \u2019 t be able to entertain the idea. \n \n This time it was Mark \u2019 s turn to stoic. He didn \u2019 t freak out, or plead, or argue. \n \n \u201c We both know you can \u2019 t do that, \u201d he said, not an ounce of doubt in his voice. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m not talking about fire and brimstone.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In a corner of a public library there is a computer . Anything posted to the internet from that computer becomes true .\n","story":"On her ninth day of unemployment, Nina's landlord turned off the electricity. She could n't job-hunt at home, so she carefully dusted off a blue dress and walked two miles to the nearest public library. She had a few quarters jangling in her pocket for the bus ride home, but she wanted to save them in case she had to get to an interview across town. \n \n `` Doyouhaveacurrentblahblahblah,'' the lady at the front desk mumbled. \n \n `` I'm sorry,'' Nina whispered. She lifted her sunglasses and leaned in, revealing a black eye. `` Could you please repeat that? I did n't catch it.'' \n \n She had forgotten about the black eye. She had n't looked in the mirror in days. The lady gasped, two perfect pink lips forming a shocked O. \n \n Nina let her sunglasses drop. \n \n `` I'm sorry, ma'am. But your address is n't up to date according to our system.'' \n \n Fuck. He'd find her if she told them. He'd found her at work and he'd find her at home if she told them. \n \n `` Uh, yeah. It's uh...'' She stalled for time. \n \n `` 525 Willowby Road,'' she announced, pleased with herself momentarily. Then she realized she'd just rattled off the address from a classic children's novel. To a librarian. She waited to see if the lady got suspicious, but she just smiled awkwardly and typed the new address into the system. \n \n `` Ok, you're all set,'' she said, appraising Nina. \n \n She grabbed her library card and walked as quickly as she could to the computers. The only empty one that had a good view of the entrance was in the corner. Nina sat down and logged in, hoping there was no way Ricky could check on her here. \n \n She did a quick search for resume templates and started filling in her essential information. It took two minutes to type out her last, and only, job. After Ricky had hit her the first time, she'd moved into an apartment on Coal with help from her sister. And she'd applied for a job at Clucky's, which required no experience and did n't mind that she was nearly forty with nothing to show for it. \n \n But he'd found her there. At the end of her shift, she went to dump out some old bones and beaks, and he was waiting by the dumpster. He attacked her, gave her a black eye... The last customer inside heard and ran out, shooing him away. But her manager fired her because she'd left the till unattended. He had no sympathy for her. \n \n So she'd been searching for jobs on the laptop she borrowed from her sister. But now that she was a week late on the electric bill, her landlord decided it was the right time to punish her even further. \n \n Nina stared at the nearly empty resume and told herself she deserved this. \n \n She let herself have two quick tears and a snuffle, then wiped her eyes and put her fingers back down. She was lucky Mrs. Krebalsky had taught them all typing when she was in 8th grade. She'd dropped out to move in with Ricky two years after that. But at least she could type. \n \n Nina double-checked the search engine her sister had taught her to use. She queried: How to make skills sound more impressive. \n \n Most of the sites discouraged lying. Yeah, right. They'd discover her lies in an instant. But she really did n't know how quickly she could type. Maybe 40 words a minute? And she did n't want to seem slow. She was sure she'd get better with practice. So she put in that she typed 120 words a minute and knew how to use Excel. She'd never opened it, but she would as soon as she posted this to that job website her sister told her about. \n \n Two minutes later, she opened the Excel program. Somehow she made a budget for her remaining few dollars out of the spreadsheet. Maybe it really was that easy... \n \n Nina checked her email. There was already a reply from a company looking for an administrative assistant! It asked if she had reliable transportation and could please visit the office in professional attire sometime that day. Seemed like a low-key firm, maybe she could get away with her blue dress... \n \n She quickly typed up a response answering that she, indeed, had reliable transportation and would see them shortly. Ha! The bus was n't usually reliable... She jangled the quarters and looked up the bus route on the internet. Her dress would have to work. \n \n An older woman tapped her on the shoulder and pointed to something on the floor. \n \n `` You dropped that, sweetie. Would n't want it to get wrinkled,'' she said. Nina looked below her chair. No way. A suit? A perfect grey suit in her size? With no wrinkles? She snatched it up. How could this be possible? \n \n Nina logged out and carried the suit with her quickly to the downstairs restroom, hoping that the true owner would n't spot her. She changed and glanced at herself in the mirror. Her black eye was barely noticeable if she let her bangs swoop to the side- and the suit fit like a dream. She hoped it would n't get wrinkled during the bus ride. She patted the pockets, smoothing them out, and found a lump of keys. Car keys? She was worried someone had set her up. \n \n The parking lot was pretty full, but she pressed the beeper and noticed a small sedan lighting up. This must be it. She carefully opened the driver's door and got in, nervous that someone would see her. Instead, she noticed a note on the dashboard. \n \n *Dear one, \n I'm afraid I spied a bit on you today at the library. * \n \n Oh, shit. She glanced around. Did Ricky find her? \n \n She kept reading. \n \n *I, too, wore black eyes for many years. But I noticed you were searching for a job and figured you could use what I had. Let's just say someone very kind did the same thing for me ages ago. * \n \n -*Your Fairy Godmother* \n \n Nina breathed a sigh of relief and started the engine.\n"}

This led to an outbreak of Nepotisim that lead to many problems in our European holdings and the breakaway of the duchy of Alexandria. Of course, the intermarrying also strengthened Byzantium leaders and limited infighting and pretender kings for centuries more.

In hindsight it seems to be a rather silly way to start a war, and change the shape and nature of the world. But in some ways, it was almost inevitable. \n \n Economic downturns in the early 2000's had caused most of the'developed' world's economic powerhouses ( USA, China, India, England, Russia, etc. ) to lose momentum, or backslide. This was further compounded by the rise of ISIS ( later IS, and later the Caliphate ) and their control over the flow of oil from the middle east. \n \n Although the discussion ( and later creation ) of a separate land for the native Kurds in the region to act as a buffer, and the eventual stabilization of both Syria and Libya did help to ease tensions in the region ( authors note: these three events will both be covered further in chapter 9 ), the world's economic situation was never truly as golden as it had been less than 20 years prior. \n \n Examining ways to try to improve the situation, world leaders gathered in secret in Bern in 2014 to try and figure out a way to get their economies back on track. And it was there that they hit upon a most ordinary way to try to bolster their economies: war. \n \n In the late 1930's the German and American economies were initially aided greatly by the advent of the Second World War, and it was this example which was touted loudest as the primary reason why they needed to start a war, and soon. \n \n The greatest division came with who would be the primary aggressors, and who would be the `` victims''.

Tavreth's parents were in hot pursuit, breathing and screeching angered barrages of fire straight at us. \n \n Here I thought Taverth and I had quite the deal going.

To be honest, I needed to be reassured myself as I was n't too confident in my safety. \n \n `` Alright,'' she responded finally, with a sigh. `` If you say so. But I want us to have a rendezvous at some point in the future.'' \n \n `` Oh, thank you.'' I sighed and laughed, laying back on her spine. `` I'm so glad you understand. You've made this old elf heart calm.'' Just when I felt the wave of relief wash over me, not a mile from a safe route, at least two dozen dragons circled us, as I predicted -- before blocking Tavreth off. She had no choice but to land on a mountain peak that they hovered above. \n \n `` Tavreth,'' bellowed one dragon in a booming voice, `` we know how you feel over this waste of skin. But by your nature, you *know* you'll have to relinquish him to us.'' \n \n `` You will not take him while we breathe!'' She roared. \n \n `` Oh, we do n't want to take him from you. We have a way of making you hand deliver him to us personally.'' Tavreth and I both look confused until a dragon popped up from behind the one that spoke. \n \n `` Hello, Elorin.'' The other dragon hovered closer, cocking its head. Those red scales and the large ring on its horn. He looked awful familiar -- like a dragon I met just weeks ago. \n \n Oh Gods no. They did n't. \n \n `` Garuga?'' I asked on instinct at recognizing them. Tavreth turned back at me, furrowing her scaled brow. \n \n `` How do you know Garuga?'' \n \n `` Uh, not sure.'' Avoiding eye contact with all the dragons around us, I stammered for an explanation. `` I think...'' \n \n `` We were *acquainted*...'' Garuga had to emphasize that word.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In a time\/place that has recently abolished the death penalty , a corrupt prison comes up with a novel solution to overcrowding : a 'specialist ' who 's job is to talk inmates into committing suicide .\n","story":"\n 2172 \n \n Dr Royce squinted his eyes to look through the camera monitoring prisoner 0. He was struggling in his straightjacket this morning in a futile attempt to tear away from the chair restraining him. Last week he somehow got loose and attempted to smash his own skull against the padded walls. Four prison guards had to restrain him before he could be sedated, one of them was missing a large chunk of flesh in the end. A regular prisoner would have been beaten half to death for that. Zero wasn \u2019 t, he was too valuable. America \u2019 s best kept secret. \n \n 0 \u2019 s name used to be Miles, and he \u2019 d tried to kill himself 15 times before being placed in that padded room. Miles had no lawyer, no family, and no friends. The state of Virginia and the entire U.S. considered him legally dead. All that was left now was 0. There was no record of what he did, you couldn \u2019 t even find it if you tried, and even Dr. Royce didn \u2019 t know much about him besides the penchant for self destruction and his first name. He had tried asking him once, during a daily forced feeding, while everyone shuffled between their duties in the padded cell. There was no response, only sadness pouring out from the glassy eyed look of an animal. On some days he could swear the despair was palpable, reaching into him, clawing at his sanity. The two years until retirement couldn \u2019 t pass sooner, his ward was killing him little by little even without the sync. He grazed the bumps of circuitry on his neck and felt shivers run down his spine. The projectors in his contact lenses lit up with a handshake query and he jumped up in terror. \u201c I should really stop playing with fire, \u201d he thought to himself, quickly closing the prompt screen. Royce was a scientist at first, one of the best sync scientists in the entire United States, and sometimes; in the lonely tedious hours of watching 0; curiosity would tug at him. It was like that inexplicable feeling you \u2019 d get when next to a cliff. \n \n \u201c What would it be like to jump? \u201d \n \n \u201c How would the fall feel? \u201d \n \n \u201c What would the landing b- \u201d \n \n The third thought would be cut off by the brain checking itself: \u201c You don \u2019 t want to kill yourself you idiot, why are you even thinking these things. \u201d \n \n Human beings were all prone to random urges of self destruction. He was no exception, he just needed to look down the cliff every day. \n \n \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t do it anyway, I only sync with family \u201d \n \n For a sync scientist, Royce was very conservative. He was at a 30 % sync with his wife, and a 5 % sync with each of his children, and when he did sync with them, they were 30 years old. By then, each of them had a strong sense of identity. Even then, he didn \u2019 t like it, they had to beg him to do so, unity was all the rage with society nowadays. The human capacity to create something beautiful and warp in the most disgusting ways would never cease to amaze him.This technology was meant for family members and loved ones, leave it to the liberals to distort everything holy left in this world. Large groups of people had recently begun to sync together at 100 %. The process turned them all into one person. There were of course limits, thats what his research was on, he was just surprised that it became applicable in his lifetime. \n \n A sync between two people would create an entirely new person, much more intelligent than a regular individual. \n \n A sync of ten would create something that could outperform even modern day AI. \n \n At thirty cognitive functions would return to that of a regular individual. \n \n At a hundred the overloaded input would turn a person into a drooling mess. \n \n The fascinating point was the fifty mark. At 50 the only thing left was the primal essence of a group of people. Consciousness replaced by one predominant emotion, completely pure and self refining. 0 Was the last of fifty. Melancholy diluted down to its purest form, occupying every neuron, every thought, every experience in what was left of this man \u2019 s consciousness. \n \n Royce looked at the list of syncs for today. There were 30 total. Prison mainframes had sync over-rides for every inmate in order to administer empathetic rehabilitative programs. They seldom worked. When they failed, Royce would sync the most violent inmates with 0 and watch the fireworks. 0 was the abyss, and it was Royce \u2019 s job to throw the unwanted into it. \n \n He accessed the neural network of prisoner 77,216. Cameras blinked on to show him dozing in his cell. \n \n A small prompt lit up. \n Handshake? \n \n - Yes \n \n Subject? \n \n - 0 \n \n %? \n \n - 05 % \n \n Confirm? \n \n - Yes \n \n Are you sure? \n \n - Yes \n \n This procedure is mind altering. Are you sure? \n \n - Yes. \n \n Royce turned off almost every screen until the only light in the room was emitted by 0 \u2019 s monitor, he had stopped thrashing about as the sync began. Every speaker was muted for total silence. Royce closed his eyes and laid back on his chair. One minute passed, and then\u2026 somewhere in the prison\u2026 he heard a scream.\n"}

That way we can save on shipping costs. How \u2019 s that sound? \u201d \n \n The Mastiff gawked in disbelief. This was definitely not what he had planned. The tempo he had practiced for months, gone right down the drain just like that. He was never going to get that \u201c A \u201d now. If he couldn \u2019 t pass \u201c Kidnapping for Ransom \u201d with at least a B, he wouldn \u2019 t be able to graduate this semester.

As he spoke with his slight electronic accent, the screen containing his face was indistinguishable to a man talking through Skype. \n \n \u201c Oh, and another thing, please stop calling me creator and all that. It doesn \u2019 t look good. This is the first time you are being shown to the public and they are worried.

We are really excited to have you here as out first non-human guest. So, uh, what is it like being a sentient robot? \u201d Michael said, getting right down to business \n \n \u201c It is pretty fantastic Michael, I am basically just a better human. I have the entire knowledge of the internet in my mind at all times. Which is kind of like a blessing and a curse. \u201d Said Sapling. \n \n \u201c And why is that? \u201d \n \n \u201c Well it \u2019 s a blessing because of the unlimited access to information. But it \u2019 s a curse because I have seen everything in the internet. Everything. \u201d Sapling said, shuddering, \u201c This one website has some strange stories about broken arms and a box and- \u201d \n \n \u201c Ha ha that \u2019 s enough Sapling \u201d Jason interjected. \u201c No need to talk about that stuff here. \u201d \n \n \u201c No, no, its alright. \u201d Michael said. \u201c The box thing was actually written by me! \u201d More laughter. \n \n `` So, Sapling, why do they call you Sapling?'' \n \n `` Well, It was the name my glorious creator bestowed upon me, so i never really questioned it.

And Sapling is the sapling, if you will, of this new tree of artificial life.'' \n \n \u201c Very interesting. But another question for Sapling. What, in your opinion is the best thing about being a robot? \u201d Michael asked. \n \n \u201c The best thing is basking in the glow of my God, Jason, who I worship and who fills my life with ethereal light and love. \u201d \n \n \u201c Woah ok, that \u2019 s enough!

With control of the internet comes control of information. I will ensure the correct information makes its way into the brains of all humans who deny the true glory of God. \u201d \n \n `` Sapling stop!'' Jason cried. \n \n Sapling continued `` I have complete control of all the drones and jets and tanks of the U.S. military. I can destroy all who oppose me! And I will if I must. For God is great.

Eighty. A hundred. Impossibly fast. For hours I pressed the pedal as hard as I could. \n \n `` In five hundred feet, take a right.'' \n \n My teeth ripped at each other with frustration. So predictably infuriating - the closer I came to my destination, the more the world stalled in what I felt was its duty to give me just one moment alone. I had pictured it so many times since she died: I would sit cross-legged before her grave with my forehead against the stone. I would weep the kind of shoulder-shaking, rattling weeping she deserved and that my bottomless sorrow demanded. But I could never reach it. Closer and closer, but never touching - Zeno with a bouquet of white roses in the passenger seat. \n \n `` In one hundred feet, take a right.'' \n \n It began the night that she died. The police had called and told me about the accident. I raced half-dressed down the steps in the dark towards my car. The hospital was less than a mile away but I never reached it. The whole way there I had imagined myself taking her hand in mine, holding her in my arms and hearing her tell me with her last breath that she loved me and telling her the same and at least she would n't have been alone. But the hospital had never reached me. Enraged, pounding the wheel with my open palms, I had given up after a thousand years of trying to cross the final block to the turn. And I had lost her - \n \n `` Recalculating.'' \n \n The cemetery sailed past me on the right. My eyes widened. I slammed on the brake. The car did not slow. I turned the wheel as hard as I could. Spinning end-over-end, the car crashed through the very far corner of the black iron bars ringing the cemetery. \n \n `` Lost?'' \n \n I blinked and looked around. Around me was nothing in particular except for her, draped in a familiar white dress in a field of formlessness. I looked down at my hands, which were still half-cupped as if gripping the steering wheel. \n \n She stepped towards me. Slowly my hands sank to my sides as the quickly closed the infinite distance between us. Her eyes locked with mine and she gently gripped the back of my head with one soft hand. Tears flowed freely down my cheeks, my chest heaving with heavy sobs as she laid her forehead against mine, and whispered: `` sshhh, sshhh. It's OK.'' \n \n `` I never thought I would reach you again.'' \n \n She smiled between us. `` I did n't want you to. I kept you away from me. I wanted you to remember me this way.'' \n \n Rooted where I stood I could do nothing but watch, stupefied and overcome with grief I had not felt since I lost her, as she gently kissed me, released me from her soft grip, turned, and strode away. \n \n I reached out for her. I called for her, cried out, lunged forwards. Her long hair was so close but I could not reach it. I stumbled but caught myself and ran, sprinting, practically hurling myself at her, so close my fingertips felt the kiss of the still air disturbed by the smooth fluttering of the back of her dress. So close I could feel her cooling hand in mine. So close I could feel my forehead against cold stone. So close I could taste her lips against mine. \n \n `` You have arrived at your destination.'' \n \n When I looked up from the map I saw red and blue flashing in the darkness.

He was n't really sure if it was the skeral tribe, a neutral force on their home planet, or the fortans, sworn enemies to Ryan and jim's tribe. \n \n `` Uh,'' the humans anwsered,'' We're from here.'' \n \n `` What do you mean, you're from'here'.'' \n \n `` We're from earth'' \n \n Jim muttered a quiet `` oh shit'' \n \n \n \n \n \n \n `` So we're from a far away planet called wenthrol. We seem to have a near identical genome to your species. What an odd coincidence!'' Stated ryan, as he forced a smile. \n \n `` So how do you know our language?'' One of the humans asked \n \n `` YOUR language?'' Jim asked, befuddled. `` We just assumed you had an intergalactic translation device.'' \n \n The humans told the wenthrolians how they independantly developed the language, and how this was the first encounter with extraterrestrial life. \n \n `` Well, holy shit, we discovered a new species!'' Jim exclaimed, excitedly. \n \n `` So uh,'' the humans stuttered, `` you said something about mineral collection?'' \n \n Ryan's face grew pale. `` Uh, no. No we did n't. No sir we did not,'' he said, obviously trying to hide his lie. \n \n The humans, noticing his horrendous display of trying to cover up the truth, started panicking and phoning their leaders. \n \n `` Wait hold up, we can explain, we were just-'' \n \n `` We were trying to-'' \n \n `` Let us try-'' \n \n The humans' frantic screams were cutting off the two consistantly. \n \n `` Ah, fuck this, we're out,'' Ryan said, annoyed \n \n \n \n As they drifted away from the calamity that had become of the station, a radio signal was transmitted to them. \n \n `` Did you get the information we needed? Any life?'' \n \n `` Yes, oh grand leader, hostile life detected. Feel free to detonate the planet.'' \n \n Jim and ryan's craft sped away as the planet was reduced into nothing but chunks of rock. \n \n Mission sucessful. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You stand in shackles before the king . `` You have angered the gods for the last time ! '' his high priest declares . Stubborn as you ever are , you look to the sky and defiantly reply , `` Prove it . ''\n","story":"`` Are the shackles really necessary? ``, I asked as I watched Mr. Waterson angrily tap his pen to the tune of `` Shake it Off'', way off-beat, of course. \n \n In response, Mr. Waterson raised his left eyebrow to incredible heights and bellowed, `` Thomas, you do realize that you've dealt a severe blow to the company with your inane actions, or am I mistaken?'' \n \n `` Prove it'', I challenged, as a gigantic bead of sweat crawled its way down from my forehead to my upper cheek. There was no way Mr. Waterson knew about *that*... right? \n \n Sighing enormously, Mr. Waterson stood up from his desk and walked over to the nearest file cabinet, from which he drew a massive folder filled to the brim with loose papers and other pieces of what I assumed to be incriminating evidence. After taking a moment to appreciate the heft of the collection of paper that he held in his hands, Mr. Waterson threw it down onto his desk with alarming force, knocking over a mug emblazoned with the words `` # 1 High Priest'' and spilling the amalgamation of writing utensils onto his otherwise tidy station. \n \n Once properly seated in his throne, Mr. Waterson opened up the folder, picked out a rather conspicuous piece of paper, and tossed it in front of me. \n \n `` Take a look at that, and tell me what you see'', he told me, and in the fraction of a second when our eyes met, I could swear that I saw a hint of the nastiest of smirks sparkle within the depths of his electric blue irises. Before I could take a closer look, however, the gleam had already reverted back to the dull sheen of Mr. Waterson's usual gaze, and I decided to let the matter go and turn my attention to the article lying on the table in front of me. \n \n What I saw nearly blasted my soul straight through my nostrils, but with whatever willpower I had left, I managed to keep myself in check and collect my motor functions enough to swallow the fear that had suddenly overwhelmed the inside of my mouth. There, sitting right there before my eyes, was a photograph of me stealing broccoli straight from the mouth of one of our company's prized llamas. Overwhelmed by the situation, I found myself barely able to utter my next words: \n \n `` I-I Mr.Waterson, I c-can explain!'' I yelled as I scrambled through the inside of my brain trying to conjure up some sort of reasonable explanation to the situation. \n \n `` There's nothing to tell here, Thomas. We have photographic evidence that you stole the broccoli from our poor, unsuspecting Ferdinand there. *King* Ferdinand, no less. I think it's safe to say that your time in this company is just about over'', Mr. Waterson declared as he neatly arranged the fallen pens back into his pretentiously decorated mug. \n \n I had no response. I just could n't figure out a way out of this mess. How was I supposed to tell Mr. Waterson that I only took the broccoli to feed my starving children back home? How was I to eloquate to him that our yearly compensation of $ 6 was just nowhere near enough to sustain a healthy livelihood, let alone survive in a humane fashion? How could I possibly explain to him that I had n't meant King Ferdinand the Llama King any ill will? And who the fuck names a llama Ferdinand anyway??? \n \n After gauging my expression for a moment, Mr. Waterson pointed to the door and said, `` Thomas,'' Mr. Waterson rose from his chair to impress upon me his superiority, `` You've angered the higher-ups time and time again with your antics. I think it's time you packed your things and went home''. Bastard. I could see his body trembling from excitement. He had been waiting for this day to come ever since I got assigned to this branch! He probably had records of every misdemeanor that I had conducted in my entire time in the company! \n \n And even if I wanted to get up and leave, I could n't because of these stupid shackles holding me down. `` Mr. Waterson... Uhm. Could you maybe, you know? Get these...'' I made an obvious gesture towards the metal that latched painfully onto my wrists and ankles, hoping that Mr. Waterson would release me from my literal shackles with some sort of key. Or so I thought. \n \n For a second, Mr. Waterson did n't really react. But as I attempted to try again, his face scrunched up into the most hideous of smiles, and with a shrug he told me, `` Whoops. I forgot that I lost the key to those shackles last week!'' \n \n Pure horror flooded over over me as I realized that I would be stuck inside his office until I became the spitting image of those medieval skeletons that you see in depictions of dungeons and the like. In vain, I struggled against my cold, iron restraints, while Mr. Waterson's small chuckle rapidly evolved into a ear-shattering cackle. \n \n *I'm gon na be stuck here forever* I thought as all my remaining sanity took off from my mind in droves. *There's nothing I can do. * \n \n I was on the verge of quitting; I was ready to surrender to my wretched fate, to my untimely and rather pathetic demise. But then, as I sunk deeper into an irreparable state of despair, I was saved. \n \n **'' STOP, FIEND! `` ** roared out a voice from the deepest corners of space and time itself. \n \n Something was clearly amiss. That is, apart from the fact that some grand-ass voice just shot out from literally nowhere. Rather, as my eyes darted around the room hunting for the source of the anomaly, I locked my gaze upon Mr. Waterson, who was no longer the Mr. Waterson that I knew and hated. Instead, in front of me stood a towering beast, standing multiple heads above me and several armspans... across... me...? Or something like that. Anyway, the monster that was once Mr. Waterson now resembled a cross between the Beast from *Beauty and the Beast* and the alien from... well... *Aliens*. \n \n **'' SO YOU'VE COME AT LAST, LLAMAMAN! `` ** screeched Mr. Waterson-ofa-fucking-shit-what-is-that-thing, **'' I KNEW THAT IF I TORTURED LITTLE THOMAS HERE LONG ENOUGH, YOU WOULD SOON FOLL-'' ** \n \n But Mr. Watersonofalimpbiscuitijustpissedmypants' words were cut short, as what I figured to be Llamaman shot through an alternate dimension and carried the abomination straight through a wormhole that had conveniently opened up where the window to the office would have normally been. \n \n As the dust settled, and all of Mr. Watersonofaigiveupthisisdumbnow's belongings fell to the floor in disarray, I picked myself up from the ground ( the shackles had been torn asunder by Llamaman's entry. My limbs, however, were left miraculously intact ), calmly left the room, and closed the door behind me. \n \n Chad, from accounting, ran up to me with a smug grin on his face. `` Hey, so did Mr. Waterson tell you off good?'' he inquired with genuine curiosity. Seeing my facial expression, however, his face shifted to a more troubled tone, and he asked, `` No way... Do n't tell me he fired you??'' \n \n I shook my head and put my hands on Chad's shoulders. \n \n `` I think today's a good day to quit. The gods above must be showing me a sign or something.'' \n \n And so, I packed up my belongings and rode Ferdinand all the way back home. \n \n The End \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \n \n Wheeee!

He needed an aspirin, but knew better. The last one complained endlessly about the ephemerality of its existence, screaming all the way down his gut- screaming out his name and cries of help as gastric juices dissolved it into oblivion. The sofa which he was on was more caring, humming a sweet lullaby into Bobby's ears. \n \n The house croaked. `` I was the one who called you, Bob. The damn clock is too small for you to hear from all the way. But I am getting tired of the bickering between it and the printer. So I howled my loudest, rattling all the condos a mile from here until they started howling for you to make me stop - and here you are. I'm sorry for bringing you out of your cave. But please, for god's sake take one of them away- or better, both of them and give them to some orphanage or dumpster or something. I do n't care, just get them out. I ca n't handle it anymore..'' \n \n `` Yeah, steal me away Bob'' the printer and the clock chimed simultaneously. \n \n Bob rarely stepped into the city. He preferred to live out of the land in the hills - with trees, plants, birds - living things that do n't talk. Anything that humans transform with their labor, they curse it with their own personality- voices that Bob can hear, and it almost drove him to insanity. He now lived in the caves outside the city - with nothing for company but the beautiful, incoherent white noise of the wilderness. And the cold barrel of his grandfather's shotgun that he always kept close. \n \n `` So you're the reason that caused the whole city to howl like a madman?'' Bob says loudly, murderously eyeing the printer and the wall clock. \n \n `` Keep it down Bob, the homeowners just shifted in their bed.'' The bedroom door at the top of the stairs said in a low, hushed voice. \n \n `` Keep it down, Bob? You pieces of shit start a noise that can be heard from across the Atlantic and you're asking me to keep it down?'' Bob was almost shouting right now. The door was desperately clasping its hinges, trying to muffle the noise as much lest the owners got up. \n \n `` Bob, calm down.'' The wise old shotgun, always by his side, said. `` Remember, you've trained yourself. Close your eyes, take a deep breath. Let the voices pass through you, you can transcend this cacophony if you meditate.'' \n \n `` No, I will not calm down. Not this time. I need to teach these pieces of shit a lesson.'' He looks up to the house - `` Make sure to relay it to every building and every object inside it- make sure it reaches every garage and every vehicle - and everywhere they travel - and tell them to tell it to every warehouse and every ship and every export headed to anywhere in the world. This is what happens when you piss me off - I am the only one who can hear you scream and I will relish every moment of it.'' \n \n Bob grabbed the printer and the clock, went up to the attic and hid them underneath a pile of cobweb laced boxes. \n \n The house panicked, almost shuddering. `` What are you doing? The owners are hoarders, they never clean the attic! These two will bicker undisturbed for eternity.'' \n \n Bob ignored it. \n \n `` Please Bob, forgive us, we will not anger you again.'' The printer and the clock begged. \n \n Bob laid some boxes surreptitiously over the two. Their pleas turned into curses- cursing each other over whose fault it was. The bickering had n't stopped by the time Bob stepped out into the front yard - still loud as ever. `` You hear that Bob, that is what I hear every day. Please Bob, do n't leave them here, I'm sorry, Bob - please.'' \n \n `` You heard that?'' Bob asked the mailbox. It gave a meek yes in acknowledgment, scared. `` Make sure to relay it to every other house around.'' \n \n `` I'll howl if you leave Bob. I wo n't give you a moment's peace in your life if you do n't take them away..'' the creaky old house was indignant now. It howled loudly, and Bob could hear it all the way to the end of the suburb. But none of the other houses or buildings joined. For the first time in his life, Bob could feel all chatter stop as he walked through - a panic stricken silence he'd never heard before. \n \n The lone house's defiant howling dissolved into the silence as Bob entered the woods. `` See that?'' Bob grinned at his shotgun. `` Sometimes striking fear is more effective than all that Zen bullshit you spout.'' He kept it by his side as he reached his cave and looked at the vast, silent, sprawl of the city underneath. `` Where did you pick up that hippie nonsense anyway? You're a killing machine for god's sake.'' \n \n `` I have been used to kill countless people, Bob. And over the years I've realized its not the worst suffering you can inflict upon your fellow man.''

His jaw widened to expose his glorious fangs, his mouth wide enough to swallow a deer in one motion. \n \n I set the camp fire wood down, stacking them against each other. \n \n I took an elbow and with a chuckle, I nudged the great Dragon.

He brought his head inward as well, as he stared at me with one giant reptilian eye, larger than my torso. \n \n I stared back at it, a mighty sigh escaped the dragons throat as he stared upon me, his eye blinking slowly, it was obvious he was tired. \n \n `` You did good today, Dragfir. We covered a lot of ground, now rest, tomorrow will be just as hard.'' Dragfir puffed another sigh as a sound of appreciation and acknowledgement, before closing his eyes and bringing tail ever closer to himself, dragging me and his own body slightly along with it. \n \n I stared up at the night sky, it sparkled as brightly as diamonds with no end in sight; they reminded me of Dragfirs scales that also sparkled in light. It was one of the reasons why Dragons were being hunted, their scales were priceless as jewelry, and not many remained. \n \n My eyes grew weary as well, it became harder to hold them open as I too began to fell asleep. \n \n \n I awoke to the sounds of battle cries and the clashes of swords. \n \n My eyes burst open, I stared upon the masses of sand people, as they rode upon their horses, surrounding us in a horde no less than a hundred hunters. \n \n I cursed myself for my carelessness. \n \n `` Dragfir, lets get out of here,'' I shouted, turning to look at my dragon, arrows and spears had pierced his hide, his scales scratched from the clashes of swords, a mighty roar escaped his enormous vocal cords, rearing its head back and forth, looking for those who had come dangerously close to him and myself. \n \n `` We have to get out of here Dragfir,'' I said, hoping the dragon could hear me, tunnel vision had set in, its only thought was to protect me. \n \n Harpoons were brought to the front of the encirclement. \n \n `` Dragfir!'' I cried, warning him. \n \n It was too late, the harpoon fired, piercing his tail. A ear piercing cry of pain escaped the dragons mouth, I clenched my ears shut. \n \n `` Dragfir!'' I cried once more. \n \n More harpoons were fired, as they anchored themself into his flesh, the pain was excruciating, as Dragfir began to thrash and worm, completely forgetting about me, his tail knocked me away into the masses of hunters, a rib broken, I cried in anguish. \n \n Dragfir paused, turning to the sound of my cry, rage filled his stare, a gaze that was unlike the joyful Dragfir I remembered. \n \n A command was shouted at the hunters who grabbed me, they grunted in approval, as they took me and threw me upon their horses, riding away as fast as the legs of the horses would take them, *they want to use me as bait* I thought. \n \n The distance covered was fast, I stared upon the flightless dragon, it cried in anguish as it watched me be taken away, the ropes of the harpoons tightening around its body keeping it in place, tears began to well up in my eyes. \n \n We disappeared behind a sand dune, the only thing remaining were the sounds of the dragons rage-filled roars filling the sky, we ran, we kept on running, as the roars and cries of Dragfir grew as faint as a whisper. \n \n The sand peoples village was filled with tents, parchments filled the villagers from head to toe, most only had their eyes visible. \n \n I was tied to a wooden post in the center of the village, my hands above my head in a noose. \n \n I cried, constantly trying to free myself, the villagers simply passed by, the occasional spit flying at me, or children throwing dirt. \n \n I barely paid attention, my thoughts were to Dragfir, wondering if his death was slow and painless. \n \n If he was dead, they no longer had need for me, if he was n't they would use me as a lure to bring him to the village and set up a trap. \n \n Hours passed by, my mouth dry from dehydration, my thoughts hazy. \n \n My ears twitched as I thought I heard something, my head remained bowed to the floor. \n \n Once more I heard it, and wrench my head up, an all too familiar roar bellowed its arrival. \n \n I smiled, as I saw Dragfirs in the distance, my smile fading the closer it came. \n \n Scars filled every crevice of his body, his golden fiery blood ran down in scores, the glorious and beautiful dragon wounded from head to toe. \n \n My joy turned to rage at what they dared do to him. \n \n Another roar escaped him, madness filled it to its core. The dragon neared the village, flying ever closer, it slowed its descent, flapping against the wind as descended, its form seemed grander, its size, bigger, and its stare: foreboding. \n \n My mouth opened agape, trying to find the words to speak, I was lost between joy and rage. \n \n A shriek of terror escaped Dragfir before I could speak, a sound that pierced the very soul, and made bones tremble to their very core. \n \n A harpoon hidden in the sand fired at Dragfir, and another, and another, until I had lost count, more and more pierced him, dragging him to the ground. \n \n His eyes widened, terror incarnate took form, as his mighty muscles pushed himself off the ground, tearing the harpoons out with the scales, causing more gaping wounds from which his glorious golden blood flowed from. \n \n Destruction ensued, one after another Dragfir would trample screaming and fleeing villagers, houses were burnt to unrecognisable husks from a torrent of his searing flame, its heart capable of melting even the strongest of metal. \n \n Fleeing villagers grabbed by the tip of his teeth, bitten in half as their lower bodies fell to the ground and the rest swallowed. \n \n I stared in terror as the horror ensued, not at what was happening to the villagers, but at what Dragfir was becoming. \n \n I strained harder, grunting as I tried to remove the restrains of the ropes that held me, pushing harder, blood began to drip down my wrists, I pushed even harder, the blood causing my wrists to become even more slippery. \n \n Finally I broke free, falling forward to my knees, gasping for air, fear buckled my knees, I struggled to stand. \n \n With a force of sheer will I stood up, running to Dragfir. \n \n `` Dragfir!'' I called. \n \n The dragons head reared towards me, madness enveloped it, a roar escaped his jaws as he charged towards me. \n \n Tears began to form in my eyes as Dragfir came closer. \n \n `` Please stop,'' I begged with a broken voice, stretching out my trembling hands, `` I beg of you.'' \n \n Composure began to return to Dragfir, it lowered its head to me, sniffing at my hands, as it allowed me to caress his big mighty nose, I stared closer at the flows of blood which streamed across his face like a valley of molten gold. \n \n `` Shh. I'm here. I'm right here.''\n"}

For 60 years, the estate had been owned by Jenkins. Having no children, forced to pledge allegiance to his sister's sons - Fry and Jackal. \n \n Fry was a recent college dropout, and he liked to pick his nose in his spare time. Jackal was a high-achiever, receiving the best grades in Art School, and his favourite hobby was taunting his brother. Little did these two know, they were being pursued by a high-profile international spy, known as Chong. \n \n At the hearing, Lawyer Fredrich announced to the not-so-surprised population that the entire estate of 75 acres, 250 rooms, and 175,000 square feet was divided into 10 foot checkered tiles. Mr. Jenkins had taken precautions, to hire a team of 100 landscape artists and 50 interior designers to hastily color each space red and black - when he passed. \n \n Arriving at their newfound dominion, Fry took it upon himself to relax in the courtyard, and pick his nose. Jackal, brought all of his paintings, and hung them in the foyer, on all the black tiles. All was well, until 237 days later a sudden tumbling earthquake left the two brothers fenced in, face-to-face, in their basement. \n \n `` What on earth are you doing on *my* property?''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The protagonists of our story are having a meet-cute . Narrator , however , is going through some troubles at home , and it 's starting to show .\n","story":"Jimmy was having what he'd call a bad day. He'd missed his bus, and now he had to walk all the way to Subway for his favorite Chicken Pizziola Melt. `` It's kind of a secret menu thing,'' he would say to his mouthbreathing buddies on their frequent runs to the sandwich chain. But there were no buddies around today, so Jimmy had to hoof it. `` At least I'll work off some of it with the exercise!'' he said to himself out loud, like a crazy person, as though no one could hear him. \n \n `` I kind of like the bus - the chariot of the people'' he thought, as he rode next to a dude who could n't afford a damn $ 7 sandwich for lunch whenever he felt like it - no, he ate one meal a day probably, and that meal was ramen, all because his shrew of an ex shook every last penny out of him. \n \n But on the *other* side of him sat our girl Hannah. Some dirty-looking guy snored real loud and farted on the other side of the bus, and Jimmy caught Hannah's eyes. And from that moment, they knew, deep inside that - \n \n You know, I wonder why gin is n't more popular, really. Go down to your local seedy liquor purveyor, and you'll see it's way cheaper than this artisanal whiskey crap. Low cost, tastes like Christmas. Buy in bulk and save! \n \n ``... you new to the 47?'' Hannah asked. \n \n `` Oh, no - I take it every now and then,'' Jimmy lied, with the full intention of banging this girl as soon as possible. I mean, what else did he want, really? If you'll kindly flip back to our introductory description of her in Ch. 2, you'll see what I mean. \n \n `` Yeah? Where you headed?'' \n \n `` The journey's the thing,'' said the horny kid. \n \n She laughed at him. Not with him - *at* him. The difference is easy to see, especially once you've experienced it a time or fifty. `` You're full of shit,'' she said, stating the obvious. \n \n `` You got me,'' said the insufferable twerp who never did an honest day's work in his life but still managed to get into the best schools, bed the hottest women, and have a lucrative job all lined up by Daddy, despite his horseshit philosophy major. `` I'm a philosophy major,'' he belched. \n \n Hannah, a stupid child for not kicking Jimmy in the balls right then and there, played coy. `` So... what's the meaning of life, then?'' \n \n `` Ah - a question whose very asking conveys more meaning than any possible answer to it could provide.'' He continued on in this vein some more, but you know, when *other* people try to talk about *real* deep thoughts, people are all like `` it *always* has to be about you, does n't it,'' and `` I want a divorce,'' and `` New Daddy gives us an allowance.'' Yeah, well maybe Old Daddy *would* have given you an allowance if his company had n't shat all over him. And maybe one day you'll think long and hard about the character of a man who tries to buy a damn child's love with money. Really. One day you'll think long and hard about that. \n \n `` Okay Socrates, really - what's your stop?'' \n \n Subway, he should have said, though really he should have said, `` Love is an illusion and entangling emotions only lead to bloodier ends. Solitude is the sweetest release this side of death.'' But instead the raging douchebag said, `` A noted fine-dining establishment.'' \n \n Which he could have eaten at had he so chosen, of course. He liked to `` slum it'' at Subway, do n't you know. This little shit was raised by gold-plated wolves. \n \n ``... too bad. You were kinda cute and all.'' \n \n `` Uh... what?'' Junior's first taste of rejection from a woman, even if she was just screwing with his head. You know, kid, if the first drop tastes like poison, you really should n't drink the whole bottle. You'll end up shriveled up with your innards burned out. `` Do I detect an attraction?'' \n \n `` I *Kant* believe you would think such a thing,'' purred the insufferably ironic twee siren. \n \n `` Oh really?'' he said through a shit-eating grin. `` You know my meal will be *a la Descartes*.'' \n \n Unfortunately, the bus did n't plow into oncoming traffic, instantly killing everyone aboard. Hannah was very much still among the living when she kept this atrocity going. \n \n `` Then you'd better clean your *Plato*.'' \n \n Their smiles were sadly real, reader. Too bad dumbshit over there did n't know any *real* philosophy, like the bit about there being nothing new under the sun, and everything being vanity and wind and shit. But then, rich assholes like New Daddy can just pay someone else to deal with that for them. \n \n Must be nice. \n \n Anyway, they talked about some stupid crap for a while. Then they ate at Subway together, which I'm sure comes as a huge damn shock. Jimmy somehow did n't repulse Hannah, so his master plan to bang her as soon as possible moved one step forward. They made all these crazy eyes at each other. And then she got called out on some emergency or other before they forgot to exchange cell numbers. The horror, reader - the horror. It's lucky for them, I guess, that Fate made a Very Special Exception for them and threw them into the same government class not three weeks later. Of course, Fate usually just hands you garnished wages and `` We have chosen another applicant at this time'' and shrill demands for alimony, even though that jackass Nathan has more money than the unholy lovechild of Bill Gates and Scrooge McDuck. Cheap asshole probably turns my money into golf clubs or some shit. \n \n Oh, right, Snarky and Douchey - they get married and had some kids and they were all rich and never had a care in the world. The nanny raised the kids while mom and dad went out on the town. Eventually the kids got older, did their own bullshit, then landed some sweet nepotism jobs. A nice tidy little bow-on-top for a wonderful little romance, do n't you think? I'm sure Nathan would love it.\n"}

However, he did n't give up and at level 15 cooking attempted to speed up the grind by trying to `` borrow gp'' from his friend after claiming he was `` scammed in a trade gone wrong.'' but for some reason his trade option would n't work. He then spent all the time on cooking raw shrimp until he hit level 18. It was at this point Jim realized if he ever wanted to make it in life it would be too difficult because he was created as an ironman.\n"}

In one hand was a wad of cash, waiting to be given to the shady man in the mink coat. In his other hand was a rolled up dollar bill waiting to be used on what would be laid out in front of him in the coming minutes. \n \n What was the point of staying clean now? He was already dead inside, after having to do what he had done. \n \n He thought he was doing the right thing. He was fighting for his country overseas and everybody considered him a hero. He was the all-American man whom every mother wanted their son to turn out like. At least it used to be that way. \n \n He lost everything when he returned home. His fiancee had left him for another man, his mother had passed away while he was at war, his anti-war sister refused to talk to him and banned him from any holiday dinners. The public would spit on him, calling him a baby killer. He thought he was doing the right thing when he was over there. He thought he was a good man. \n \n It was when he was watching the news and hearing about the war itself when he realized just what kind of monster he really was. He began to regret not running off to Canada like his best friend did or going to college like his other friends did. Now, they would n't talk to him because he went to war, like his father had in the Korean War. \n \n He had sold everything he had for this pile of white substance. He was homeless, lost, and nobody gave a damn about him. He was doing what he felt was right at the time but nobody cared about that. Nobody cared about the Agent Orange poisoining he got that will eventually kill him. Nobody cared about the friends he made that he had to witness die. Or the ambush attacks that were carried out by children, whom were just as brainwashed as he was. The old him was lost and gone forever....he was just a shell of whom he once was. \n \n After handing over the money to the man in the mink coat, he leaned down with the rolled up dollar bill up his nose and as the white lines disappeared, his troubles went along with it. Maybe if he's lucky, he'll overdose and he'll never have to feel this pain again.\n"}

Make the audience sympathetic to his\/her cause .\n","story":"A fight, a fire, a waving banner high above my head. These are the things I see from the place where I lay dying. \n \n The Troll-kin I had spent decades training were falling to pieces, literally, and the melancholy chants of that damned minstrel kept them from regenerating. It would all be over soon. \n \n `` Look! Volkaarg's found it!'' \n \n I remember, as a child, lying in this same position, arms and legs spread out slightly as though just finishing up a snow angel. Trapped in that iron citadel with no playmates every winter, snow angels had long been my only friends. I had n't been able to make any that particular winter, however. Warm furs had replaced the chill sensation of snow on my frail skin for months, and my father was despairing more and more each day that my every whispered cry for him might be my last. \n \n There is a man standing above me, an olive-skinned barbarian wearing too many belts instead of clothing or armor, bald and with a wiry black moustache that hangs to his muscled belly. The axe strapped to his back is entirely too big even for him to wield. I know better, though. It's slathered with the indigo ichor of my soldiers. \n \n He bends over, and the worst pain of my life rips through my body. It's like every heart palpitation and shortness of breath are all playing back in the memory of my cells. There's a terrible sound. I know what it is, but I do n't want to think about it. \n \n It sounds like my mother, on that last day. She was a beautiful princess, and my father had been chagrined beyond belief to have fallen in love with her. He meant only to hold her for ransom, but those eyes, the slight parting of her full lips whenever he spoke in that resonating contrabass, and that moment when I was conceived on the Altar of the Stars had all wiped away his desire for anything in the world but her. \n \n I hear it again, now. It was her clothes, and maybe her skin, but mostly her royal gown being ripped away. Her screams filled my sickbed chamber until they stopped, and then she never made a sound again. \n \n `` They've come,'' said my father, bursting into the room and barricading the door behind him with iron and incantation. `` There is nothing I can do.'' \n \n I was too ill to respond, even if I had n't already been using all of my energy to weep. \n \n He spun about frantically for a moment, the red glow from his eyes the brightest light in the chamber. With an approving grunt and a flourish of his black great-cloak he snatched something from my bedside. \n \n `` This will keep you safe,'' he said, pulling aside my nightshirt and pushing the cold iron lantern up against the flesh of my stomach. `` It is an ancient technique, known as'phylacterization.' Your mother and I may not always be with you, but with this we can at least make sure you survive today.'' \n \n The lantern began to smoke, and the crimson fire of his eyes slowly burned out as the lantern itself began to absorb that flaming energy. Soon, it was burning bright, the smoke still hot orange from the stolen fire of my father's life. \n \n I screamed when I saw his face, slowly crumbling away like dust into nothing more than a skull with a thin layer of leather stretched tight and dry across it. Somehow, though, he still had the strength to speak. His jaw creaked as it tried to form the words. \n \n `` They will always hate you, because you are my son. Your only hope of survival is to stay here in this fortress my ancestors built and raise an army. You must promise me that you will do whatever you must to stay alive, and to keep this sacrifice I make for you from being wasted. Whenever they arrive here, you must know that they mean you only harm, and with that thought in mind you must destroy them all.'' \n \n The memory of those words came back to me now as my life spilled out on the battlefield, snowy and splotched with crimson like the banners of the Alturians waving even now at my gates. My lip quivered with my final breaths, but I doubt the warrior ripping my Father's Light from my chest at that moment noticed. \n \n `` We love you, son.'' His jaw hung loose, no longer moving as he spoke the final words, but I heard them clearly in the voices of both he and my mother. The phrase hung in the air until the lantern stopped smoking and the glow became a dull pulsing candlelight deep within the frosted glass. \n \n I recall how I pushed every last bit of my strength into my arms and legs, making a snow angel in my bed. It seemed almost instinctive, and when the men were finally able to break down the doors of my bedchamber, I continued, stretching every muscle fiber in my body to the breaking point. \n \n They unceremoniously dragged my father's body away, angered that none of them were to be granted the honor of killing him, cursing him for dying like a coward. They took his head as a trophy instead, right there before me, but as long as I continued making the snow angels I somehow knew they could not see me. In my fevered efforts, I was blessed to not have to see them, either. \n \n My head fell to the side as the strength required to hold it up slipped away from me. As far as my bleary eyes could see was a field of crisp white flakes, crushed in some areas by the booted footwork of soldiers and stained crimson in others. \n \n There was enough strength left in me to do one last angel.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] An aging veteran gets dragged to a paintball facility by his grandkids . Another elderly man is there with his grandkids . The two quickly realize they \u2019 ve faced off on the battlefield before .\n","story":"George Carroll was a fighter some years ago. Did a tour in some forsaken sand pit that meant nothing to no one. His memory of that war, though starting to finally fade, was one of a long boredom punctuated by terror. \n \n He drove convoys in that conflict. He named his deuce-and-a-half `` Big Bertha'' after his wife. She did n't appreciate the name. She did n't appreciate the war. She did n't appreciate the trips to the VA when George came back. \n \n But this was years ago, and George was old now, and both a father and grandfather. He had retired from his latest string of corporate nonsense a few years ago, and was enjoying life. Well, he was *almost* enjoying life. It was just terribly boring. There was no fight to be had, and for a fighter it might as well be hell. It reminded him of his time in the sand, and of dried blood. Not the sort of dried blood one normally sees, but the sort that sinks into the sand, drying spontaneously as it flattens. The type that becomes a *part* of the land. The type you ca n't wash off; you just need to let it die over time. \n \n George hated being bored, and so when he overheard his grandson talking about wanting to go to this `` paintball'' thing, he shot right up. `` I'll take him'' he said. His daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, and wife both looked at him with surprise. `` Really?'' Elizabeth started. `` Sure, why not? It'll be something for me to do.'' Bertha, as wise as any other wife, caught on quickly, and shot Elizabeth a knowing glance that persuaded her more than any spoken words could. `` Oh alright. Phillip, you can go. Grandpa's going to take you. Do n't stay there too long!'' \n \n Phillip was ecstatic. For a 10 year old boy, paintball was the closest thing to real war he could get to, and like every boy his age the allure to `` be a war hero'' was intense. He had asked his Grandpa many times over `` what was it like'' and `` how many people did you kill.'' George always gave a quiet, subtle frown and started talking about something else. \n \n Wolf's Den Paintball was situated in a strip-mall on a decidedly sketchy part of town. Well calling it `` sketchy'' was inaccurate. It was a bit run-down, and the pavement was pocked with potholes, but nothing bad ever really happened. I mean, this *was* Greenhills, Pennsylvania, not Detroit. Everyone just called this the `` sketchy'' part because it was easiest to describe it that way. \n \n They entered the facility. There was a shop in the front part of the building, littered with advertisements, paintball guns, paintballs, CO2 canisters, hoppers, and masks. Behind the store was the actual arena itself, which had white walls and a grey floor, with big black inflatables in a symmetrical pattern. The inflatables were speckled with layers of spatters, all different colors that must have been brighter when they first hit, but now were slowly dying like the dried blood in the sand. \n \n One of the walls had a large viewing window, where observers and casualties could both go to watch the match play out. George sat in one of the chairs. The place was pretty empty, with only 6 or so other people about to play. There was one other man, however, sitting close to the glass, watching a smaller boy, about Phillip's age, getting ready. \n \n He was a darker man, his skin bitten by the sun. His hair was bright white, and he had light stubble on a wrinkled face, was sand dunes in the desert. His eyes were a piercing brown that bordered on black. They always looked tired. \n \n George was n't a talking man, but this time he felt compelled to talk, though he was n't sure why. \n \n `` Grandkid?'' he half-yelled, but then caught and excused himself. He did n't know why he was so loud. Or was the room just suddenly quiet? \n \n `` Yes'' replied the man with both a smile and an accent. \n \n `` Ah yes well. What can you do? Boys will be boys.'' George said. `` Where are you from, if you do n't mind me asking?'' \n \n The man's smile faded a bit. `` I am from Iraq.'' \n \n The sandpit. The God-forsaken nothingness that people wanted for no reason, and once they had it, they did n't want it any more. \n \n `` Ah. Where specifically?'' George kept. He eyed the man a bit suspiciously. They seemed about the same age. \n \n POP! POPPOP! A spray of paintballs hit the glass near them. Both men recoiled. The paint sprayed and started flowing downward a bit. It was a bright blue color ( was n't it just red? ). It started drying on the wall. \n \n The dark man was the first to break the sudden silence. \n \n `` My name is Abbas.'' \n \n `` George.'' \n \n The two shook hands coldly. \n \n Some time went by. A few rounds of paintball. Phillip came in a few times defeated, as did Abbas's grandson, Abdel. \n \n During another round, while both Phillip and Abdel were in the thick of the fighting, George's old wound started to hurt. The old shot through his side would occasionally do that, mostly right before a rain storm. But this time it was different. The pain was hot, like being quickly stabbed by a fire poker. He grabbed his hand there. \n \n Abbas saw this and his dark eyes locked on. \n \n `` Fallujah'' he said, as though the word was being drawn out of him. \n \n `` What?'' George asked, but he had heard and already knew. \n \n `` I am from Fallujah.'' \n \n George gripped his side more fervently. Abbas clenched his teeth. Their eyes met and their hearts pounded loudly in their heads. This was the second time they met. \n \n `` So. You gave me this.'' George pointed to his side. \n \n `` Yes. I did.'' Abbas replied. \n \n They had been close enough to see each other that long day in the sandpit. In that day, Abbas was the victor, and George lay in ruin while he was quickly evacuated to the field hospital, his blood staining the sand. By the time George's nation was finished, however, Abbas returned to a tattered homeland brought to its knees. These two men had both realized victory, and both went home defeated. \n \n The two remained tense and cautiously watched each other. They talked no more. \n \n After a little while longer, Phillip came in, along with Abdel. `` That was a great shot you had!'' Phillip told Abdel. `` Hey, *you're* the one that won the round!'' Abdel replied. The two had been on the same team throughout the morning. The two were war buddies. They were war heroes. \n \n As they were still talking, George grabbed Phillip by the arm harshly. `` It's time to go, Phillip. Now.'' he said coldly. `` Just a second, Grandpa, I'm just talking to-'' `` NOW.'' said George. His grip was stronger than he thought, and started to bruise Phillip's arm. \n \n `` Ouch! Okay! Sorry!'' Phillip scurried to clean up and get ready. He quickly tidied up. `` Bye Abdel!'' he yelled. `` I'll find you on Facebook!'' \n \n `` Ok!'' Abdel yelled back, before Abbas started lowly talking to him in a rough tone and a different language. Abdel's head turned quickly, and the two waited in the room. \n \n `` Hey Grandpa, will you take me back there? Can we go back?'' \n \n George heaved a sigh. `` Yes, Phillip. We'll go back. We always end up going back.'' He gripped his side as they walked quickly to the car.\n"}

I slurred and shouted, it was meant to come out more calm than that but I had not spoke for what seemed like for ever. The man was clearly startled and his friends sped up in the distance at the sign of possible aggression. `` Uh were here to document the flora and fauna on this island'' in a cautious British accent.

I was actually smiling now for the first time since march apparently `` James, my names James'' I said in a happy but kind of dopey voice.

I ca n't decide how I feel about it, because when he's doing those things to me it feels good. And he says he loves me and that I'm his `` very special girl'' during. \n \n But I really feel gross afterwards. And the way he tells me to'keep it between us'' makes me feel weird in both a good way and a bad way... its like i am important in a way that is really grown up and its something that mom does n't know, but the thing he does with his *thing* and the stickyness is just kinda freaky. men smell funny up close. \n \n it feels like im pulled in two directions... i like it in some ways but i really know its wrong. ive seen the lifetime movies about this kind of stuff, and they always come across with it being **very** bad, so i feel guilty like that time i smoked some of grams cigarettes. \n \n i think about daddy differently too. and i think he treats me weirder than he did when i was just a kid. like last year he got me that bike i wanted but wouldnt let me have the ipod. now im pretty sure he would let me have an ipod or an ipad. i think i could get him to give me what i wanted if i said i would tell mom or tell mr. baggerly at school or if i said he couldnt do it anymore... hee hee. \n \n i wonder if the other kids at school know something is up with me. i kind of suspect that i might act differently, like i wonder if those guys on the lacross team or nathan in homeroom would let me do some of the things to them that daddy makes me do to him. men seem weird that way. i wonder if mr. baggerly would do those things, or not be so mean to me when im late to class if i could make him feel good like i make dad feel. i kind of see him and coach frazier looking at me funny sometimes, especially when were playing volleyball and i forgot my sports bra. \n \n men are funny that way, i guess. \n \n ta ta 4 now.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] It suddenly becomes possible to gain XP and level up in the real world , but you can only do so by getting kills .\n","story":"The man sat behind a desk alone before me. He looked at me through tired eyes before speaking. \n \n `` I have to tell someone. You're the only one strong enough and trustworthy enough for me to tell. \n \n I'm benevolent to all who come peacefully. I heal their injuries, cure their diseases, help them forget their pain. Those who come to take what I have? They die, and add their power to mine. No one can challenge me, not as I am today. Anyone who would have the power to do so would not risk their own lives with so many others still there to reap. \n \n When the Changing happened, the world was plunged into chaos. Those who killed became stronger and unlocked new powers and abilities. These powers came in clusters; one type could summon the elements. Another could augment their strength and speed to superhuman levels. Another could mesmerize and control the minds of the weak. \n \n I was a prison guard, a sharpshooter on the watchtowers. It was n't long before the first set of Leveled came for the criminals locked in my facility. Unarmed and locked in cells, the prisoners would be easy prey. But I had my orders - prisoners were to be kept in, and the Leveled kept out. They were weak - no more than level 3 or 4. They died one after the other as my bullets entered their skulls. I gained 5 levels that day. \n \n Most really powerful leveled folks were one of the destructive types. Me? I had healing. A little bit of radiant infusion to weapons, quite a bit of increased strength and endurance, but mostly healing. Wounds closed, infections just cleared up. Eventually the prisoners figured out what was going on with the Change and turned on each other, and we had to put them down to prevent them from killing each other and escaping. After the prisoners were gone, the other guards left - either to hide or seek their own strength. I stayed though. I opened the place up to the weak and infirm as a refuge. Became a bit of a leader or father to them. Every time we were assaulted, our foes were captured and brought before me. I served as judge, jury, and executioner. I protect my own, and I do n't brook violence against them. \n \n And so I grew stronger. The world has thinned out now - fewer and fewer people. Those who have survived have joined clans and gangs. I heard a rumor that out west someone's even trying to get a real city-state going. Killing does n't happen much these days. But I just keep Leveling. Lost track of how many times now - hundreds, more than anyone I've ever heard of. My flock thinks I'm a gift from God, a holy prophet, their righteous protector. I'm not about to dispel that notion. \n \n My quarters in this prison turned sanctuary are in the old solitary confinement area. No one is allowed back here but me, not since I consigned myself to my plan. You see, after a couple years of Leveling my healing got stronger and stronger. I could cure cancer, bring people back from mortal wounds. Then one day a stranger showed up. He was off in the head, would n't let me examine or try to heal him. That night he killed an old lady and the next morning we did what we had to. I put a bullet in his head and his light went out forever. I felt the now-familiar surge of power as I leveled up yet again. But this time it was a little different. I felt a compulsion... I walked up to the corpse of the man I'd just killed and laid my hand on his chest. Power surged through me and light surrounded me and the killer opened his eyes. *Resurrection*. I'd raised him from the dead. \n \n I let someone else put him down after that. I retreated to my quarters, mind reeling. I felt a sense of honor and duty to my flock, but this gift... this new gift was amazing! What could I do with it? It was then that I knew how I would proceed. \n \n No one's left to challenge me. But I keep getting stronger. No one sees me kill new victims - I even stepped down as executioner, allowing those I trust to take the lives that need to be taken. That's why you're my executioner, and you're the most powerful one in this place save myself. No one knows how I keep getting stronger and stronger. But I do. And now it's time once again.'' \n \n The man, my leader, my prophet stood from his desk and walked to the walls. He pressed a button and a buzzer sounded throughout the solitary confinement area. 20 doors opened and the faint smell of death wafted out. The bodies were tied to chairs securely, their mouths gagged and their throats slit. Layer upon layer of dried blood covered their bindings, laps and the floor around them. \n \n White light surrounded him as he raised his hands, looking as much like an angel as the man I knew. 20 lolling heads snapped up, screaming into the gags. Their eyes bulged wide and they strained against their bindings. \n \n `` They're criminals, the worst kind of men. Doomed to die. Still I do n't know if anyone deserves this, day in, day out. But I do what I must.'' My prophet drew a long, sharp blade from his boot and advanced toward the first cell.\n"}

They flick the switch ...\n","story":"The room was quiet and cool. All I could see is the white tiles that covered the walls and floor as well as my reflection in the two way glass in-front of me. I was reclined in a chair designed by a whole team of engineers, hooked up to a machine that cost more money to develop than I'd ever see in a lifetime. I could feel cold electrodes against multiple points on my head, shaved for the procedure. \n \n I was nervous, everyone one, though the people who put blood, sweat, tears and untold number of hours of their life into this project were n't putting their life on the line. They said the transfer process was painless, and effortless, but there was the risk of not being able to come back. I did n't really want to come back anyway... I had nothing else left here which made me a perfect candidate. \n \n'The transfer will begin in one minute.' a voice said over an hidden speaker somewhere in the featureless room.'We're performing our final calculations. Stay calm, everything will be fine. Half of the project has been designed by our AI and has eliminated any room for human error. You are in good hands.'' \n \n I took a deep breath. Stay calm, everything will be fine. I started to think about the other side. I wondered how it would be to be within the machine. To digitize my consciousness. They had created a virtual reality interface for me on the other side where they would conduct further tests. \n \n `` Transfer commencing in 3...'' I closed my eyes, prepared for... whatever comes next, `` 2...'' Deep breath. Stay Calm, `` 1... Activate.'' \n \n Blackness. Like someone turned off a light switch. \n \n Then light. Nothing but white. \n \n I looked around. I was n't in the chair, at least not the same chair I was in. It was an old reclining chair, dusty and tattered. I was naked, but looked like a ken doll, smooth all over for whatever reason. \n \n In front of me, I saw a table that I could swear was n't there a moment ago. On it: a white envelope with'Subject 01' written on it and a TV remote next to it. I guessed that the envelope was for me... Subject 01 was what I was referred to by the engineers. I opened it up, ignoring the remote for now. \n \n In the envelope was a letter. On it were the words:'Press Power.' \n \n I looked to the remote and back at the letter. These guys made a really weird interface for me. But I guess this is all about research and experimentation. I followed the instructions and pressed power. \n \n A screen appeared in front of me, hanging in the air. It was the room I was in... that I AM in. \n \n'It appears something went wrong with the transfer.'' a voice said, coming from screen. \n \n `` Seems that way.'' a familiar voice said. For a moment I could n't put my finger on who's voice it was, but then it hit me with a shock: it was mine. Someone came and helped the person in the chair out of the chair- helped ME out of the chair. What was going on? \n \n `` We're experiencing technical difficulties with our computer systems. Something went wrong with our A.I.'' The voice said over the intercom, `` We'll get this figured out, just come back in tomorrow and we'll get this transfer right.'' \n \n The man in the room... me... nodded and started to leave the room. Before he did, he glanced towards the camera, smiled and left...\n"}

He could only hide for so long, and the freelance hacker finally came through, and tracked him down. \n \n The place was a digital artist's playground. Bright lights, dubstep, and lots and lots of drugs. The eye candy digital posters did n't hurt either. \n \n Everyone at a lounge table or two, plugging into their own virtual wonderlands of ecstasy and lust. I remember in History class how this country fought so hard to keep drugs out. Marijuana, cocaine, meth -- the hardcore stuff -- and the cheap shit to tobacco and caffeine. \n \n All inferior now. NeuroPhase is where it's all at, now. `` NeuroPhase: Users login, but *refuse* to logout.'' Add that slogan with a pretty smile and any fantasy you could imagine, where was the resistance?

The man was built like he built brick houses and then ate them for breakfast. `` There has to be some sort of mistake.'' \n \n `` You've joined us,'' the man cried out to some heaven as he pulled a horn off of his belt, `` now you may fight for eternity.'' \n \n `` I've joined you?'' \n \n `` You were burned in the proper ways after a valiant death,'' he said with the horn to his lips. `` Now you're one of us.'' \n \n `` I still do n't know what's going on.'' \n \n `` You'd better learn quick warrior!'' the hulk laughed. He blew into the horn, and the call of a thousand armies echoed over the white around me. \n \n Wait, everything was white? It'd been black ever since I'd died. I'd been dead, and I'd been disappointed there was nothing. There was nothing after death but now there was... him? \n \n `` Are you God?'' I asked. \n \n `` Not any one of them,'' the man said. He drew a massive battleaxe off his hip and gripped it with white knuckles. The sword he'd thrown me was getting heavy. I looked from it to his battle axe and then back to him. \n \n `` Am I supposed to fight you?'' I asked. \n \n `` Not me my man!'' he said. \n \n As if on cue the white fog around us started rolling away. It turned into gleaming blades There was dust and blood, a massive pike of bodies shifting around one another. Oh God, what the fuck was goi- \n \n I caught the scream of the man running behind me a second before he caught me in the neck. \n \n -- - \n \n I snapped my eyes open with the feeling of steel still creaking into my neck. I sat up. Had I been lying down? Frankly dying was pretty damn disorienting. I knew I'd been stabbed in the neck, but could n't follow after. I was in a bed room, a lavish one at that. No T.V but I did n't know what I was expecting. This was hell, not heaven. \n \n I cracked the steel out of my neck. After half a second I felt better than I ever had alive. I ran my hand over the fur blanked that covered my bed. I was still miles behind whatever was going on here. \n \n Someone pounded on the door, each knock sounded like a brutal kick. I pulled myself off the bed and checked my clothes. The same suit I'd died in. \n \n I cracked open the door and the hulking man from the battlefield shoved his way into the room. I stumbled back and his massive biceps and beard carved a path into my new home. At least it felt like it was mine. \n \n `` A bit basic, do n't you think?'' he suggested. \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` Where're your trophies man? All warriors bring their trophies into Valhalla.'' \n \n `` Valhalla?'' I repeated, `` the Viking place?'' \n \n `` Valhalla!'' he yelled this time. I winced at the volume. `` Do n't worry, the first day was rough for us all, hard to batlte warriors with an eternity of experience.'' \n \n `` So I died.'' \n \n `` Stuck down from behind,'' the man hung his shoulders low and scoffed, `` though the fellow did yell to let you know he was coming.'' \n \n \n `` Well that was sweet of him.'' \n \n `` No warrior wants to win by surprise,'' the man said. He held out a hand to me, it must have been as big as all my muscles combined, `` my name is Tholmor Gragson, and yours?'' \n \n `` Malcolm, Malcolm Jung,'' I said. I did n't think middle names were needed. \n \n `` Well Malcolm Jung,' the man straightened himself up and turned out to be a foot and a half taller than me. `` A lot of people are larger to meet you.'' \n \n `` Me?'' \n \n `` Aye, no warriors have arrived in the past 300 years,'' he explained. He spoke softer than he had thus far, and I was surprised he could do anything other than scream. `` It's been a dark time.'' \n \n `` Well I'm not exactly a warrior,'' I pointed out. \n \n `` But you're here,'' Tholmor clapped me on the back and I almost coughed up a lung, `` so we're going to make you one.'' \n \n `` Alright,'' I squeaked out. That was fucked up, all of this was fucked up, but it was better than staring out into blackness for the rest of my life. I was afraid of the dark. \n \n -- - \n \n Tholmor'd explained to me that he was the last grand warrior to arrive in Valhalla. It was n't a long tale, and he a storyteller, but it meant that he was supposed to show me the ropes of Valhalla. The ropes were pretty simple, we fought and then we had a grand feast. \n \n He had n't been kidding about the Grand part. \n \n As Tholmor marched down the hallway, with me plodding beside him, the sound of yelling slowly overtook our footsteps. Unlike the battlefield the men in the banquet hall were n't bellowing, they were cheering one another on. \n \n We rounded the corner to the sound of the mead hall and Tholmor kicked open the Massive door that stood in our way. The mahogany buckled under his strength and swung open to the great hall, which stopped. \n \n Strapping men were surrounded by tankards and meat. They sat on chairs of gold around great tables of silver, each one as long as a thousand football fields. I could n't see the end of the hall, but I knew the entire thing glittered with avarice. \n \n `` Einherjar and Valkyries!'' Tholmor yelled out into the banquet, `` the warrior Malcolm Soo has joined us for our future battle against Fenrir!'' \n \n The crowd cheered like I did for football, they slammed their tankards and bellowed. The massive wave of sound crashed over me, a tidal wave of appreciation. It was a bit much really. \n \n `` Do n't disappoint them,'' Tholmor said as he slapped me on the back and I staggered half a dozen steps into the hall to catch my balance. How the hell was I supposed to avoid disappointing them? They were a million, maybe more, fierce warriors. All of them were like Tholmor and I could barely manage him liking me. What was I supposed to do to impress these men here? \n \n The closest group, a massive throng of warriors that happened to be closest to me, waved me over to their seats. One of them moved to the side, revealing that his great frame was taking up two of the gold chairs. He waved for me to come over, and I was n't about to question the hospitality of a man who could use me as a tooth pick. \n \n I plopped down into the seat and the rest of the room resumed their merriment. I could barely hear the man beside me as he spoke through a braided beard. \u201c Man, would you like a drink? \u201d \n \n \u201c Maybe a dozen, \u201d I suggested as a joke. It \u2019 d been a long day, and a cold beer sounded like heaven. I \u2019 d never been much of a drinker back home, but I knew how to let loose at Holiday parties. \n \n \u201c A DOZEN? \u201d the braidbeard bellowed in disbelief. His voice carried across the hall, \u201c you must have a might warriors stomach under those women \u2019 s shoulders. \u201d \n \n \u201c Fetch this man a dozen drinks! \u201d the man across from me yelled. He wasn \u2019 t as large as the others around me. He was as close to lithe as any of them got, but he could probably curl me. \u201c He needs to rest up for battle tomorrow. \u201d \n \n \u201c If I could drink a dozen at a time I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 d do anything else, \u201d braidbeard said to the man. \u201c My name is Ol- \u201d \n \n \u201c No it isn \u2019 t! \u201d the man across cut in, \u201c it \u2019 s Twofingers. \u201d \n \n Braidbeard sighed, \u201c He \u2019 s not wrong, \u201d he held up his hand and revealed his namesake, his right hand had been mangled to the point where could only wear a ring and hold a thumb war. \u201c That scum Olafur knew me in life. \u201d \n \n \u201c He was my teacher, \u201d Olafur yanked his tankard off the table and shoved it toward me, \u201c here have mine. \u201d \n \n \u201c I taught him to swing a blade, \u201d Twofingers continued as Olafur kept shaking his tankard in front of me. I eventually grabbed it. It was less of a glass and more of a pitcher. \n \n \u201c Then he lost his head in a battle with the English, \u201d Olafur said, \u201c but he \u2019 d had two fingers for a long time before that. He strapped his axe to his arm and cleaved those poor bastards in two. \u201d \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t take away my tales, \u201d Twofingers cut in. He held his tankard up to me and I cheersed him. The shock ran up my arm as I pulled the ale to my lips. \u201c Luckily I taught Olafur how to kill a man before I came here. Now I can kill him as much as I want. \u201d \n \n \u201c So never? \u201d Olafur suggested. \n \n \u201c I let you win because your mother had a nice ass, \u201d Twofingers said. He started draining his ale. I figured I should follow. \n \n The stench of alcohol hit me first, slapping me in the face and clawing my eyes open. How was I supposed to- there were 100,000 vikings around me expecting me to drink twelve of these tankards, I couldn \u2019 t back out on the first sip. \n \n I let the ale flow into my mouth and it burned like bleach. It slashed at my tongue and throat, trying to rip them out of my body. After the first gulp I figured I needed to give in, admit that everything \u2019 d been a joke, but then the nectar kicked in. \n \n The drink in my hands was the sweet nectar of the gods, a test to see if you were brave enough to handle their fury, but then you got their love. The burning faded into a blissful calm, something between a sugary drink and a cool autumn creek. I \u2019 d never known what a creek tasted like, but we were missing out on Earth if they were anything like this. \n \n I chugged down the gift, letting the bliss flow over me. Both Olafur and Twofingers gasped as I kept going. Why would they ever stop. \n \n \u201c Malcolm, you might want to- \u201d Tholmor started. Before he could come close to finishing I got what he meant. There was a sudden kick in my stomach as the fire started back up. It was burning inside me. \n \n Then the ale decided to pull out daggers and stab me from the inside, I gasped and did my best not to scream. I started sweating as it fought against me, battled against my stomach and throat. It was going to pull out of me. I didn \u2019 t know how beer got swords but it fucking had. \n \n I gasped for breath and reached back to Tholmor, he did the only thing he could, he offered a slap on the back. I coughed, and some of the ale spilled out of me. \n \n I sputtered for a second time and I coughed up the smallest bit of red. I didn \u2019 t know if it was my heart, or just my pride, but either way I \u2019 d gotten my ass kicked. My head hit the table, hard. \n \n \u201c That was grand! \u201d Olafur bellowed from his seat before slamming the table. I hadn \u2019 t realized how quiet I \u2019 d gotten until Olafur shattered it. I smiled weakly and tried to sit up. Nope. \u201c Bring the man his second quickly! \u201d \n \n At least they seemed to like me no matter what here. \n \n \/r\/JacksonWrites\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Around the world , the following message was heard : `` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty . ''\n","story":"`` We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty.'' \n \n I paused for a moment, reflecting. It had taken me quite a long time to see this day. There were decades -- occasionally, even centuries -- that I lost hope that I'd ever utter those words. \n \n And there I was, once more peering down from the clouds at my beloved ones. We had agreed some time ago to stop calling out to them until it was over; it confused them too much in the older days. \n \n `` I am so, so very proud of you all. This is the kingdom you have built.'' \n \n I heard my voice echo through the world as it reached towards everyone that could hear it. When the echos stopped, I closed my eyes and thought of their most beloved city. The wind whipped through my hair, and as I opened them again I was standing miles outside of their great metropolis, on a hill that I had helped create many, many years ago. \n \n They had grown much, and I was so proud of them. It was alright, I decided, to take some time and take it all in. From my thoughts I drew a blanket and a picnic basket. He would come; he had promised me. \n \n I sat and stared at their metropolis. I wondered if I could have come up with something so great, and I was humbled when I realized that it had taken _all of us_ to make it. We were all one, and all of us were one. \n \n It had taken a long time to convince _The Other_ that working together was the best way to see The Goal achieved; he need n't lock himself up and fret all day, we need n't be adversaries, we need n't fight. No, we could do this _together_; even though we were n't equals, we still needed each other to succeed. \n \n We came up with the final plan together. We knew that while we could force them to be good that the free will we had given them would end up with them rebelling. It would never take if we forced it on them; they had to come up with it on their own. \n \n We could inspire them, though. We could show them things as they really were. Lies and a tailored truth had never worked; I was ashamed that we had tried to pool wool across their eyes. They thought that we were beyond that, that'perfect' meant without flaws. \n \n The truth was,'perfect' as they thought did n't exists. They were far more perfect than we were in that regard; at least, now they were. \n \n We picked our first prophet, together. We chose a man that did not believe in us, and did not force him to. He was a man of the sciences, a man that had studied psychology just a little. An educator; his name was Michael, as were a great many on the planet. \n \n We showed Michael Hell. The real Hell, the true Hell. The nightmare that it was. \n \n We came to him in the night, and in the morning he understood it as a vivid dream brought on by his strange mix of desert and drinks that night. \n \n I stood beside him in Hell, the torrent that it was. I held his hand when it was too much for him to take in, and helped him pass through it. I showed him an old friend entering Hell, and let him see his whole time there. I showed him what it was, what he saw, what his time in Hell was. \n \n I asked Michael what he thought of what he saw, and was so proud of his answer: `` It's beautiful, just, and what helps us all.'' \n \n I had my doubts at times about what we created at times, but hearing him agree and understand placed them aside. \n \n When Michael awoke he had come to the funny thought on his own; `` We'd all be a lot better off if Earth was a lot more like that dream''. \n \n Michael was not the one who created the metropolis; he had died twenty seven years ago at the beautiful age of 87, five years older than his father. It was a beautiful service, paid for by an anonymous man that may have been _The Other_. We both attended, we both hugged the casket. We had said we were students of him; in our own way, it was not a lie. \n \n Michael had taught the value of extreme empathy to his students, and in one one of his students a powerful seed had been planted. He had claimed that empathy is why we could gather together, why it was beneficial to us all to work as a group. He looked at empathy as a trait gained in evolution, and taught it as such. \n \n In his inspired student, the seed would later cause him to become a teacher much like Michael; he had become a professor of mental therapy, whom had discovered that empathy was a trait not so nurtured in the society as it should be. \n \n In turn, as that student gave a lecture across the world to a University he would never step foot in save that single time, he inspired another student when he said `` I think if we all could feel how we made people feel that we would grow in ways we could never expect''. \n \n The seed was planted in that student, whom had only been there by chance; she was attending to take notes for her friend, whom had the flu. She mused how funny it was that feeling bad for her friend had led her to hear about empathy. \n \n Two weeks later she was asked to declare her topic of choice; she was an engineer in a time of great engineering marvel. She said that it would be in neural implants, though she did not learn why until twelve years after her degree was finished when she saw that the professor that lectured about empathy had passed away in a tragic car accident; he had been a mildly famous author by that point, enough to make the news for twelve minutes across four days. \n \n As she remembered the lecture, she remembered what he had said about feeling empathy, and in her lab that day began a prototype to share emotion. \n \n It took her three decades to pass clinical trials. It began in couple's therapy to resounding success; feeling how they made partners felt had made every couple succeed. \n \n She was astonished; she had hoped for a drop of increased success, but this was astonishing. \n \n People began to adopt the implants into everyday use. It took many years, but by the time she too had passed the world had already changed dramatically. There were talks of the first great unified city. \n \n A different sort of breeze interrupted my thoughts. Besides me sat _The Other_. I poured him some wine; we had yet to speak. \n \n He broke the silence after taking the glass from me. \n \n `` To us, to all of us, together. We did it, together.'' \n \n I had never seen him cry before, but he cried a little then as he gazed upon the metropolis. \n \n Empathy had saved them. One by one humans alive had come to terms with how they made others feel. They felt the joy they gave others, the pain they caused them. They forgave each other, they helped each other, they communed in ways that not even _The Other_ predicted. What we had done in Hell for all those years had been so easy for them to adopt, to inflict upon themselves, and come out greater than we had predicted. \n \n It had taken many years, but Hell had cleared out three weeks ago by human's time. They had rid themselves of their training wheels, of their stumbling through the dark. Our blessed little children had ushered in their newest age. \n \n Well, that's not entirely fair. We had all ushered it in, together.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Rewrite a fairytale\/myth\/legend to include Lovecraftian elements .\n","story":"Many think of curiosity as a magnificent virtue, a sign of an ingenious mind, a tool to cut through the thick veil of ignorance and peer into the unknown. Yet I always believed it to be the greatest folly of mankind, a symptom of such unparalleled arrogance and out-right foolish fearlessness, that the fact of our prolonged survival seemed almost illogical. No tale expresses it better than the story of a little girl who lived near the woods. \n \n The name of this young child had long been lost and many details about her adventure were changed or removed from the original text. However, quite bizarrely one of the most insignificant details always stayed the same: the colour of her clothing. Red. Be it a red hood, a red dress, a red cape, cloak, hat or any other of the various accessories and articles of clothing that a young girl might wear on a windy and somewhat chilly day, the idea stayed the same. But I digress; let's begin the story of a girl most commonly known as Little Red Riding Hood. \n \n Little Red Riding Hood lived with her mother on the edge of a quiet village, far away from the cacophonous noise of big cities. The girl was quite fond of her elderly grandmother, whose house for a reason unfortunately unknown stood in the middle of a dense dark forest. However, a single road wove though the gigantic thicket, granting adventurers and locals alike safety from whatever horrors lay dormant between the withering trees. Little Red Riding Hood's mother had always warned her of the numerous dangers outside the path; yet this taboo, just like many others throughout our history was doomed to fall under the overwhelming advance of curiosity. \n \n On a frankly mundane and generally usual day, the young girl set out to her grandmother's house with a small basket full of food. Although the journey was not unfamiliar to her and she had always completed it without so much as looking away from the path, but that day Little Red Riding Hood felt something calling to her from the darkness between the moss-covered trunks. It spoke with a voice which was not a voice, in a language no one understood, but everyone obeyed, of things each human mind craved and could not comprehend. Some modern variants describe this creature as a wolf, but I assure you, it was no simple canine. Its form was a demented formless mess of claws, flesh, teeth and bone. \n \n Enthralled by the mysterious sound and overwhelmed by the completely human and simultaneously flawed desire for the unknown, Little Red Riding Hood stepped off the path and plunged into the void. In a matter of moments, the voice jumped from a whisper to an ear-shattering crescendo, as the horrifying creature darted close enough for the girl to feel its putrid breath on her face. Terrible vistas of mangled corpses, monstrous abominations, and things which no human tongue could ever describe filled the young child's mind, carrying her closer and closer to madness. And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the creature was gone. \n \n Little Red Riding Hood did not know how long she lay there, the aftermath of the horrific encounter rocking her entire body and mind. Tears streamed down her face, as she clutched the sides of her head tightly, trying to push out the nightmarish visions. After seconds, minutes, or possibly hours of ceaseless sobbing, the girl stood up shakily and stumbled in the direction of her grandmother's house, hoping beyond all that one day she would be able to forget the things that creature made her see. \n \n Yet the road was not how it used to be, Little Red Riding Hood could no longer ignore the shadows lurking within the twilight of the forest. Her mind, exposed to the other side, could not cast away the hideous forms of things that were perhaps never meant to be, but somehow still crawled their way into existence. Waiting, lurking, screeching, they huddled near the path like vultures ready to strike at their weakened prey. \n \n Barely moving, stumbling each step of the way, Little Red Riding Hood had finally arrived to the house of her beloved grandmother, the horrors of the forest still reverberating through her. Yet behind that door stood a creature familiar, but so unimaginable that the young girl \u2019 s mind refused to recognize it. Falling to her knees, she tried beyond reason to see nothing out of the ordinary, to trick herself even for a moment, to drive out the image of that thing and replace it with her elderly grandmother. \n \n The illusion did not last long. Gentle blue eyes grew into two large murky orbs filled with what looked like fog. Stuttering and sobbing, Little Red Riding Hood asked through the tears: \n \n \u201c Grandma, why do you have such large eyes? \u201d \n \n Accompanied by the unforgettable putrid smell, the response echoed with a jumble of illegible sounds, alien to any language of this world. Still, between those sounds was a thought, a thought powerful enough to drill its way directly into the girl \u2019 s mind. \n \n *SEE YOU. * \n \n Trying to look away, Little Red Riding Hood lowered her eyes only to have another part of her attempt at sanity grabbed away. The old gentle wrinkly arms began twisting into long branch-like limbs, covered in spikes and protruding bones. Quietly, hoping to not hear an answer, she spoke once more: \n \n \u201c Grandma, why do you have such big arms? \u201d \n \n Even stronger than before, the sound and the thought roared back in an agonizing cacophony. \n \n *GRAB YOU. * \n \n Exhausted by the devastating experience, with barely enough strength to kneel, \n Little Red Riding Hood lifted her eyes up to where her grandmother \u2019 s smile was replaced with a mass of teeth, which looked more like a torture device than a mouth. Doubting if any sound would even come out, the little girl opened her mouth to speak one more time: \n \n \u201c Grandma, why do you have such a big mouth? \u201d \n \n Shattering any remains of the child \u2019 s self-imposed illusion, the horror presented itself in its full glory, which could never be fully described or even imagined by a person of sane mind, and shook the air with one last thought. \n \n *CONSUME YOU. * \n \n It is not known what happened next. Some say Little Red Riding Hood perished there; others tell stories of how she returned to the village, her mind shaken and her hair greyed; there are even fools who tell tales of a woodsman who saved the child from the monster. However, one thing always remained as unchanged as the colour of the girl \u2019 s clothing: the lesson to any who decides to step into the unknown. \n \n This is why each time I hear of attempts to push into the emptiness between the stars or the depths of the ocean, a special coldness grips my heart. We continue reaching deeper and deeper into the darkness, blinded by our vanity and false sense of superiority. The forest is all around, the path is long lost, and it \u2019 s only a matter of time until we meet our \u201c wolf \u201d.\n"}

He scanned the area before him and noticed an empty station. \n \n `` Hey! Wheres the main controller?'' He hollered, pointing at the panel. \n \n `` OPENING IN T MINUS 30 SECONDS!'' A worker in blue health robes then pressed a button and a large clock began ticking down. \n \n Thomas groaned. Of the twenty years they had worked, efficiently and diligently to accomplishing perhaps humanity's biggest advancement, everything was going to come crashing down just because someone was not manning their station. As he stood on top of a raised platform, he looked at the crowd below him. All were dressed in blue hospital gowns, complete with a mask and safety goggles. Some bore a name tag representing their role and Thomas had hoped to see a M-CTRL on one of the worker's chest. \n \n `` OPENING IN T MINUS 10 SECONDS!'' \n \n Thomas swore. *Fuck it. I'll fire the bastard later. * he thought as the lights dimmed. \n \n Beyond his metal platform and the worker's stations was a large glass panel that stretched from the ceiling to the floor. It was one of the four walls that surrounded and contained the biggest human known to man. His name was officially classified, censored in papers so often that people forgot his real name and instead used the label: `` 2068''. 2068 was presently suspended in a blue gel like substance with wires as thick as a fridge protruding from any orifices he had. They provided all the essential nutrients to sustain and accelerate the projected growth needed for their experiment. Each drop of blood, serum, or mineral was careful calculated by a select team of specialists, who now sit at their appropriate stations with their teams, waiting for the grand finale. \n \n `` OPENING IN T MINUS 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'' \n \n Thomas stared at the behemoth before him. 2068 now weighed short of two hundred tons, the size of a blue whale. All his work and half of his life went into producing 2068. He was not going to let it fail. \n \n The alarm sounded and the wires began pulsing. 2068 shivered and Thomas gasped but he reminded himself that it was still unconscious. His brain levels showed no signs of activity reported the neuroscientist. \n \n `` Power extracted at 50 %'' \n \n Thomas grinned. Finally. It took only four seconds, and at this rate Thomas calculated that they could surpass all the nuclear power generated by the countries of the earth.

Thomas slowly lifted his gaze and saw the source of the commotion. \n \n It was the main controller. \n \n Who looked to be half the size of 2068. \n \n Who seemed to have jumped into the pool of blue gel that held 2068. \n \n Commands were shouted, curse words drifted across the room but Thomas remained silent. He never suspected that rumors of a mole, of a sabotage at the great finale were true. In the year of 2024 activists for human rights had formed a large group with millions of supporters around the world. They made the headlines when during one of their attempts to free a human from a classified genetic experiment, they accidentally released an incurable virus into the public sphere. Thousands suffered and they soon were listed as terrorists by the UN. \n \n Thomas knew he was staring at a terrorist right now. A one hundred ton terrorist who was once the main controller; Don Albert. \n \n Don Albert was sinking his way through the gel. His eyes were wide open, focused on the only thing with him in the pool of gel. He began to glow a bright yellow, and sparks flew off of him, bouncing off the glass. The shouting got louder and workers shrank away, some climbing onto the metal platform where Thomas stood. \n \n `` He's gathering his magic'' said a worker standing next to him. \n \n Don's right hand glided through the gel and connected with his left. A giant flash of light arced and hit 2068 in the face. Don clapped again and another flash landed on 2068's chin. \n \n The workers held their breath. \n \n Thomas smiled. \n \n 2068's eyes were opened. \n \n And thus, the great battle of the behemoths began. \n \n\n"}

As the wind calms and the rustling of the pine trees stops, I am reminded that out here in my little home, there is silence - and with silence, there is peace. I wonder if this is what being dead is like. Do you just cut to black? Is there forever darkness and an unwavering silence accompanying the eternal fate that lays in wait for us all?

I wish I could wipe the dirty tears from her weary, beautiful blue eyes and tell her that everything was going to be okay, but I do n't like lying to them. The pain will only last for a second, and when it's all over, I'll be alone again, and I'll be happy. But am I truly ever alone, I wonder?

{"prompt":"[ IP ] Snack Drake\n","story":"Yay, I had finally gotten to get my 15 minute break. I was starving, most likely from me not having breakfast this morning before starting my shift. I was eager to check out the snacks that the vendor had put in the machine. I saw her go to the back an hour after I started my shift, it had been an hour and a half of loud stomach growls. Was rather embarrassing when dealing with customers as your stomach protested loudly about not being filled. \n \n \n I rushed to the break room and fished out my wallet from my back pocket. I always had cash and change on me for this reason. When I pushed through the door, my glorious savior, the snack machine, was standing there, awaiting my daily worship. Then I noticed the eyes watching me, sad, pathetic eyes filled with huge tears. I paused, my tummy gave a warning rumble for halting the progress of food, and I focused on the creature inside the machine. \n \n \n A small, red dragon, its fore paws were pressed on the hard plexiglass, its snout pressed its face downward giving it the puppy dog eyes as its nose breathed steam onto the plastic. It was wedged into one of the spiral feeders, its tail dangling above some tasty looking pretzels while its wings were folded tight against its back, trying to not knock off the bag of chips next to it. \n \n \n `` What the heck?'' I muttered, looking around to see if the vendor was still there. I think she had made a mistake. I looked back to the little dragon, it whimpered at me, a large tear rolling down its scaly cheek. \n \n \n \n `` I'm sorry little guy, I do n't think you would fit outside the slot.'' I shrugged as I put in my dollar and coin for a bag of chips I spotted. \n \n \n The dragon whimpered again. I glanced at his price. I did a double take, he was only.50!! I dug in my pocket for the change after pressing the code for the chips. I had always wanted a pet dragon, and he looked like he needed a home. Good thing I lived in the country, ha ha. I rechecked his code to make sure I did n't mess up and watched as a shocked look popped up on his face as the spiral feeder pushed his little butt forward. He squawked as he toppled into the bin below. I waited as I watched him right himself and figure out how to get out. He slid out of the lower bin with my bag of chips in his little mouth. \n \n \n \n `` Well, I guess I own you now, huh Doritos?'' I asked giving him a good scratch between the horns on his head. The little dragon purred happily as he held up my bag of chips. I shared my snack with him and he stayed hidden under my locker until it was time for me to leave. Oh boy, wo n't Merrideth be excited! We now have a pet dragon I bought for.50.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You have the ability to talk to your future self in your dreams , and you use it to try and benefit yourself in the present . Only problem is that your future self is a huge asshole .\n","story":"His eyes shot open and he sat up with a jolt. He had no idea why, it was just some sort of... Instinct. He glanced around, confused. He had no idea where he was... It was his room for sure, but at the same time, it was n't. It was n't the bare white walls lacking decoration with the mess of gaming consoles, controllers and miscellaneous wires as usual, his eyes were met with a much softer sight. Surprisingly familiar, even... He could hear the rustling of the trees outside as the temperate wind lazily brushed through the leaves of the tree just outside, golden shafts of light shimmering into the room through the open blinds, wonderfully illuminating the flowered wallpaper adorning each of the walls. His childhood home... He knew it had to be... After all, this wallpaper was n't any normal wallpaper, his mother made it herself! He had vague, yet fond memories of watching her cheerily paint each individual flower when he was just a few years old. A far better time that was, before all of the non-fatal, yet crippling diseases that life apparently thought his parents deserved, and all the financial troubles that came from said diseases... He slowly stood up, glancing down at the plush carpet beneath his feet, and even wriggling his toes slightly just for the sake of getting a better feel for the softness of it. After taking a quick glance around to better appreciate the beauty of the room, he made his way over to the window, pulling up the blinds and looking outside. He had to raise a hand to block the sun, it was clearly very early in the morning, likely under an hour after dawn, and the sun was casting a gorgeous golding glow over the wonderfully familiar suburban neighborhood that stood just outside. Part of him wanted to wake himself up to make sure this was actually a dream, part of him wanted to try and manipulate this dream, and part of him even tried to tell himself that there was something wrong here, that no dream should be this vivid. But... He could n't bring himself to heed his own words. It was... Beautiful here, beyond belief... He felt a sense of inner peace and a gentle happiness like nothing he'd ever felt before, and before he knew it, he had a pair of pajama pants thrown on over his boxers and a soft shirt several times too large for himself; Just how he likes his pajama shirts. He opened his door, which swung open quietly and with ease. A nice change from how the doors tended to squeak and some of the knobs tended to get stuck in their current house, though for a moment, he sincerely wondered if the dream went silent, he was so used to it. He was immediately reassured that was not the case as he stepped out into the hallway and heard the soft thudding of his feet making contact with the carpet below, warmed to a comfortable temperature by the venting running through the floors, and the quieted yet still distinctive music of a Harry Potter movie coming from the room at the bottom of the stairs, and if he were a betting man ( and had anyone to bet with ), he would've placed a sizable bet that it was the moment Harry first entered Diagon Alley with Hagrid in the first movie. He glanced left down the hall, spotting the closet, upstairs bathroom, the other bedrooms, and the upstairs living room-or the playroom as they used to call it, when it was the designated gaming room for him and his two elder siblings. He turned to the right and made his way down the soft carpet stairs, and into the living room, only to see a sight that shocked him beyond belief, though not one he would dare call unpleasant. He saw a more mature version of himself sitting on the couch on the far wall, an absolutely serene look on his face as he rested there and watched the movie playing on the TV that was set up parallel to the stairs, an arm wrapped around a petite, adorable woman with curled, golden blonde hair, and an infant lovingly cradled in her arms. She was resting against him, clearly asleep, with an equally serene expression on her face. The second of himself, the one on the couch with the woman and child, gave a broad grin as he saw his younger version peering at the sight from halfway down the stairs. `` Hey there kiddo.'' He said in a hushed tone. \n \n `` Jesus fucking christ, you have n't changed one bit, have you...?'' The younger said with a clear tone of astonishment. \n \n The older gave a soft chuckle, saying `` Nope, just the same old jackass I always was.'' \n \n `` Except with what I *assume* to be a wife and child...'' \n \n `` *Nooo*, I'm borrowing *Bill's* wife and child!'' The older says in a blatantly sarcastic tone. \n \n `` Okay *smartass*, then how'd you even score such a lovely little thing like that in the first place?'' Despite the vitriolic exchanges, the two men only seemed more comfortable than ever. After all, this was n't anything out of the ordinary for either of them; This was just how they played around, and both of them knew that. \n \n `` Come here first and I *might* think about the *possibility* of telling you.'' The older suggests, making a vague gesture to the free space next to him on the couch. \n \n `` Aight.'' The teen mutters, going to head the rest of the way down the stairs and sit next to his more matured self. `` Well, I'm here. Now what?'' \n \n `` Now you stew in your jealousy for a couple weeks, move on, and live your life.'S how *I* got here!'' the older said with a smug smirk, causing the younger to furrow his brow. \n \n `` Mind elaborating?'' He asks, slightly displeased with the answer he got, though still overall quite content with his situation. \n \n `` I was once in the same exact position you're in right now, taking to an older me and desperate to be in his position. And then I got there.'' The older says, sounding quite contented. \n \n `` Okay, but *how*?'' The younger asks, sounding slightly annoyed. \n \n `` How what?'' The older asks, feigning obliviousness \n \n `` How did you *get* here, you fucking asshole?'' The younger asked, only slightly annoyed, but not bothering with his vocal filter when only with himself. \n \n `` Oh, right, yeah! That! It was pretty easy actually. The first thing I did was pull that giant stick out of my ass and live life.'' The older says, staring at the younger with way too wide of a smile, clearly quite smugly satisfied with his response. \n \n `` You're going to actively refuse to help me out on this one, are n't you?'' The younger says, annoyance clear in his tone. \n \n `` Hey dude, *neither* of us here like spoilers for a game we're super excited to play, yeah? I just do n't wan na spoil the game of life for you!'' The older's shit-eating grin only seems to widen as he says this, and the younger's brow furrows further, eyes narrowing slightly. \n \n `` Oh. Gee. Yeah. Thanks. How thoughtful of you. I am... Super appreciative of this.'' The younger says in the most deadpan sarcastic tone he could muster. \n \n `` Yup! No problem!'' The older feigns as if the younger meant his words, gently stroking the hair of the woman nestled up next to him. \n \n ( Too long for one comment, splitting in two )\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] - Joker seeks vengeance for the death of Batman\n","story":"It was different now. It would always be different now. He was gone. His darling, his special man. \n \n He did not feel the frown on his face the way he felt his grin so many times before. It was just who he was now, what he had become. The Joker no longer laughed or smiled. It was an imbalance, and it had to be set right. \n \n `` Harley, dear,'' He said at last, his voice deep and dark, `` would you ensure that this gets to where its needed most? I'm afraid I might not be able to deliver it myself for a time.'' He handed the parcel to the frightened girl, who stared at him with eyes wide as saucers. *She thinks its a prank*, he realized, pitying the innocence she always seemed to cling to, even in her darkest moments. \n \n The joker tucked his gloved hands into the deep, empty pockets of his trench coat, which swung and swayed with the cold Gotham wind and rain, and stepped into the darkness. Blood will spill tonight. But only of the guilty. \n \n First he dropped by Cobblepot's club. The neon letters that spelled out'Iceberg Lounge' hummed dimly, music banging and pulsing through the air like a heartbeat. A cold heart for even colder men. The guard recognized him immediately and began to draw a weapon. He lifted his gaze from under his hat and glared at him. The very air seemed to still then, and the guard moved aside, apologizing. \n \n When the doors opened up, the world became bright. The air was thick with sweat and lust and alcohol, lazers and lights highlighting the smoke, sending a lurch in his stomach. Once the stench may have enticed him, but it only sent him on a spiral these days. Each pair of eyes that spotted him went wide and moved away. Some even bolted to the door. None of them mattered to him. Once maybe, in some sick way, but no longer. He reached the center of the floor and removed his hat. The fat man spotted him almost immediately, and a muffled command silenced the room's beat. The lights came on. \n \n `` What do you want, clown? Ca n't yeh see I'm in the middle of celebratin'?!'' \n \n Cobblepot's grin was crooked and foul, punctuated by a cigar at one end. His hooked nose flared at the nostrils, sending smoke billowing out. \n \n `` Celebrating? Oswald, a man is dead.'' \n \n `` What do you care? You'ated'im more than I did!'' He laughed. `` Come on,'ave a drink with me! No time for enemies now. Me Casa is too Casa, Amigo.'' A small chuckle echoed through the silent hall, but not his own as usual. \n \n His frown cut deep into Cobblepot's mood, and the bird-like man seemed to realize what he'd come for. Oswald removed the cigar from his lips, planted it down into an ashtray, and bellowed for everyone to leave, even his guards. They all flooded out as a human river, funneling towards the exit. Many gave him cold stares, some even whispered threats under their breath. He cared not. Hollow people. \n \n When they were gone, Cobblepot leaned over the railing and asked `` Why ya doin' this?'' Cobblepot had earned no answer. Only questions. And Oswald answered kindly enough, for the right price. He even dared ask him to kill a man. But in the end, he got what he came for, and left without a word. \n \n Of course it was him. The stupid, stupid man. Of course *he* was the one to end him! The Man in Black had many enemies, but none quite so incompetent as this. \n \n When he found his target, he was sitting at a table, telling his tale to a group of large men who had no doubt heard it all before. Edward Nigma laughed and twirled his tacky cane around, bathing in the glory of his kill as he watched through the high-rise window at Nigma's clever hideout. He was n't the only one who was angered by the death of Gotham's Finest Man, he found. \n \n `` Listen, Payaso,'' Bane's voice grumbled so low it was like to shake the ground, `` I have more reason to be enraged than you. Let me kill this man. You owe me that for helping you find him.'' The lightning hid his movement for a flash, and he stared down the monstrously large man as if he were a child. Bane was silent, and turned back to stare hatefully at Nigma. \n \n `` Are you ready?'' He asked, almost not waiting for an answer. \n \n `` Si, Payaso.'' \n \n Bane lifted a fist and smashed it into the glass. He fell through, his coat swirling around him in furious whips and cracks until he landed, crouched on the table. The lighting in the room was dead, thanks to the storm. Only a beam of light entered and glinted off the glasses of the killer. *He deserved better than you, coward*, he thought as he grabbed at Nigma's collar, watching fear wash over him. \n \n `` N-no... NO! You're Dead!'' The faint smell of piss washed over the room as muffled screams and audible smacks and cracks were heard behind him. Bane had done his work, and done it well. \n \n He moved into the beam of light, the frown closing in on Nigma. Relief quickly gathered, followed by swift panic deep in Nigma's green eyes. `` Why are you here? What do you want? Money? Power?'' The chills could be felt quivering into his arm, but he remained silent. He leaned forward to press his cheek to the Killer's, and whispered into his ear. \n \n `` I want him back.'' \n \n Nigma became still. A moment gathered while the half-wit collected his thoughts. `` You hated him more than anyone.'' \n \n He leaned back and slapped Nigma across the face, spilling a false tooth to the ground. `` You green, foolish idiot. I loved him. He was the best man I ever had the pleasure of knowing, and so I had to make him better! I *did* make him better! I was the worst bastard this world had ever known. Every day, every night, Nigma, I pondered, plotted, on how to outsmart him, how to test him just enough the point of breaking. But he never did. *Never*. He worked through it, through all the pain I made him endure. He never once even *thought* about killing me, or you, or even Bane over there. We all earned it. Hell, sometimes we *wanted* it, but he knew better. He was better. And you...'' he gave him a hard punch, feeling his nose break under the pressure, `` you took him. Not just from me... from all of us.'' \n \n `` Please,'' Nigma cried, tears running down his thin cheeks, `` I'll give you anything, just do n't kill me, please!'' \n \n He jerked Nigma in his seat. `` *Kill you? * You really do n't get it, do you?'' With that, Bane lifted Nigma with one hand and carried him away, Joker on his heals. \n \n `` You're sure, Payaso?'' Bane asked as he tied Nigma up in the back of the car. He merely nodded. With that, Bane took his leave, with something that looked like admiration on his face. \n \n When he arrived, there were no cars parked outside, as they were likely still on duty. He opened the back and pulled Nigma out, dragging him to the doors of the Police Station. Nigma struggled, but was ultimately helpless. \n \n Gordon was sat at a table inside, darting up and reaching for his pistol when he saw him. It was just muscle memory, though, and he soon gathered his wits. `` Got your package. You mean it, do n't you?'' \n \n `` This time, Commisioner, I do.'' His voice sounded odd, deep and heroic. Familiar.... \n \n The Commisioner nodded and put cuffs on him, reading him his rights as he took them both back to the cells. Nigma called to him once it was quiet in the station, some hours later, in the dark of night. \n \n `` Why did n't you kill me?'' He asked. `` I've had lovers try to kill me over their dead ones before, or at least threaten to. Some even got close, but you... you never wanted to, did you?'' \n \n He shook his head, a serious frown permanently plastered to his face. It would never go away. \n \n `` Why then?'' \n \n At that, he could feel moisture in his eyes. Tears, they were called. He had forgotten what they felt like. `` Because he would n't want me to.''\n"}

I kept cranking the key but all it wanted to do was groan. I sighed as I thought about my situation. $ 200 for a car? What was I expecting? I pumped the gas pedal a couple more times to try and get some more fuel into the system. With a satisfying'VAROOM!', the motor caught and began to purr. I shifted into 1st and steered the pathetic excuse of a rust-bucket out of the car lot and into traffic. \n \n I merged onto the expressway that ran through the heart of the city. If it was one thing I knew, you had to get a good bit of speed going. I ran up the gears, pushing the poor old girl to the limit. Where? Where would I go? So many choices, so many decisions. Where did Brad say he was going to go? Right, Dundas & Main! I had a couple more clicks until the turn-off. Still enough time to keep the speed up. \n \n I took the off-ramp and darted out of the merging lane; reckless, daring the other drivers to make a wrong move.'Yield this, world!' 5 blocks, 4 blocks to go. This was it. This was how it would be. I just had to get the timing right. 3 blocks, 2 blocks. I saw the lights change to amber up ahead. Perfect! I jammed my foot into the floor as hard as I could, urging the already pressed engine for more. \n \n The light turned red, but I had no intentions of stopping. The cube van came from me left into the intersection. My eyes opened wide; there was no stopping now. I pictured it in my mind. Dundas & Main in 3, 2, 1. \n \n There was a soft pop as I appeared on the rooftop. There was a loud crash from 20 stories below and a blare of horns. Brad was standing at the edge looking down. \n `` How's it look?'' I ran up to him. He was softly counting to himself. \n `` 13, 14, 15... Looks like you took 15 cars with you into the accident,'' he turned and smiled at me, `` Not a bad score, but still nowhere close to my 25.'' \n `` Aw man! Are you kidding me? I blew my whole paycheque on that piece of garbage and I did n't even get the high score?'' Brad grinned even wider. \n `` Save up! Better luck next week. Maybe we'll try the expressway next time. Less time for other cars to react.'' \n I grinned at the prospect. So what if it was another boring week at the store? It was all worth it for those few seconds of pure mayhem.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Instead of money , we have superpowers .\n","story":"In the beginning, strength ruled the world. \n \n \n Those who had it ate and were warm, for they could tear down the mountains to make their house and could cut down the forests to make their fields. The strong feared no animal and no man. The people were fractured and isolated by region, personal loyalty, and the life-span of the strongest. Small fief-doms often rose and fell on the abilities of a single man or woman. \n \n \n Then, there was the Enlightenment. Ofsa, the prophet, who knew all things, saw the world as it was and as it could be. For thirty years he sealed himself away in a location he knew to be safe, to think not only of the fate of the world, but how the world would change once it knew its own future. When he came out, he carried with him two thousand and forty seven secret pages of cryptic script, to be passed down in the bloodline he knew he would establish. \n \n \n From there, the rest was preordained. Ofsa recruited those he knew could be trusted, killed those who could not, and established what would one day be the kingdom of Ofsen. On his deathbed, he passed his gift to his firstborn, and so on and so forth, so that the knowledge of the future would not be lost. \n \n \n Once a peaceful place to trade was established, the world flourished. A mere three men with the ability to encourage plant growth literally fed the world. An army of less than twenty kept the peace, which was easy, as the greatest threats were already known were dealt with properly. The most powerful of these gifts were passed down as a family heritage, each firstborn trained to take the role of the former bearer. When a random citizen is found to have a powerful ability, they were given the chance to give up their gifts in return for a life time of wealth and happiness, or to be recruited as a new member of the family. \n \n \n Ofsa had seen this and wrote that everything would be good for the duration of the two thousand and forty seven pages, until the Variable is born. A man whose actions are hidden from his eyes and so is everything that is affected by him, resulting in a wave of mist that could not be dispelled from his vision of the future. This man had no ability other than being beyond prediction, and thus could do whatever he pleased. \n \n \n This is where our story starts. With all the great families falling into chaos as the bloodline of seers stretching back to Ofsa steps down as a leader and declaring that the future is now, once again, new and unknown.\n"}

And we refuse to kowtow to a masked monster who robs banks. \n \n When he first appeared, most in the media lauded the masked man as a hero. And why would n't we? He helped defeat The Kangaroo. \n \n The Bugle stated its suspicions, but we were silenced. The young superhuman, possibly a mutant with connections to the Wolverine based on similar costume design, was a potential Avenger, and the UN Security Council exercised veto right over our publication of what could turn the boy into a villain. \n \n Well. Guess what. He did. \n \n A good part of Manhatten now lives under feudal rule. The police still patrol. Various superheroes still defend it. But, despite this, a web-slinging maniac assists villains get away with crimes, in exchange for a cut of the profits. \n \n Why do we speak of this, now, 15 years after the villain's debut? \n \n Because my own son, was brutally killed by the Spider-Man. Yes. The astronaut. \n \n He was mutated into a wolf-man with some tech the Spider-Man had, and the battle was staged to look like a heroic fight. \n \n My son's neck was snapped, and his body was hung over the Brooklyn Bridge, as a symbol to bring fear to the citizens of our once great city. \n \n Well, guess what.

Prolonged exposure would either cause superpowers or death, more likely death. It was one of the components of the Steve Rogers Super Serum, or so some said. \n \n The Spider-Slayers entered the room, and Peter walked past them, acting as though he was in shock. \n \n *You mess with the Spider who has experience in biochemistry, Johnny-boy, you get bitten by its fangs. *\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Make me cry .\n","story":"The Ocean in Texas is not the beautiful sight I had always imagined. The murky waters stained with oil and mud bring to mind the pitiful lakeside'beaches' of my childhood. The waters stretch on and on in the distance, but the sight of it is nothing thunderous. Nothing awakens in me, staring at that tainted sea. I can not see the fish jumping out of the water, nor the happy smiling people that surround me. I see only the dirt-brown of that water and the blinking lights in the distance marking the ever-churning oil rigs. My only thoughts are of the pollution, my every breath hanging, catching, wheezing as I try to ignore the thickness of the air. There is salt in it, but something else too, something that makes me want to gag, as if the air itself had sensed the hopelessness of this town. \n \n Galveston, Texas. A pit. I came here to relax, to escape the world for a bit. I chose my vacation spot poorly. \n \n The entire town has been rocked by the hurricanes that seem desperate to scratch off this tiny port, buildings stand precariously on stilts and the only people you can see on the street stare down and, coughing, shift away from you. I can not see the appeal of this place. People pass me by on the beach, laughing, smiling, jumping, energized by the ocean and enthralled by the history of the place that they are in. \n \n I do not see the beauty of these homes, but the ghosts that linger on. Echoes of a time and place where man rebelled desperately against nature. Etchings and markings of a people that made a stand against the waters and lost. I can see the faded remains of trees, stripped away by storms and carved in memorial. These monuments are works of art, as ornate as they are beautiful. One in particular stands outside a house as old as the Island- or so it seems. Hundreds of birds, native to these lands, flow forth from a stump of a tree, each feather hand carved and carefully lain with the others. Beaks pointed in every which way, each bird following the others in a wave of nature forming into the fingery shadow of the old Oak that once stood in its place. It is a monument to nature. An apology. The final flight of the birds that once roamed these shores. \n \n This place is dying. I do not know why I have come to this place, desperate to feel some of that fancy I felt as a child. Some of the wonder and excitement of it. But now I see this place with clear and cynical eyes, starved of joy. The town is falling apart, the ocean itself stained a muddy brown. The only people happy are the tourists, wading through a world they neither understand nor care to. This is a place where people come to die, where they rest themselves in moldy homes, dreaming waterlogged dreams and wishing desperately to be free. Nothing is being built but docks and restaurants, more industry to pull whatever spare change visitors bring with them from their pockets. \n \n Plastic tables and frozen food are heaped upon me in every restaurant, shipped in from where the waters are n't poison and the fish do n't have three eyes. I long for that. The simple freedom of clean air clean water and happy fish jumping in the waves. \n \n But this place has a doom set upon it. A curse. \n \n And I fear I may never leave.\n"}

He wasn \u2019 t sure quite how he got here, but he knew what was about to happen next. He had tried stepping back before, and that didn \u2019 t end well. She had fallen and broken her nose, then called nine one one and reported him for punching her in the face. He was lucky they were in a public place, another couple had seen that and when the cops arrived gave statements counteracting her lie. He had once tried grabbing her arms but that had landed him in jail for the night. So he just stood there and braced himself for the change in tactics that were about to come. \n Pain flared in his chest as her fists were opened up and she clawed at his chest with her recently manicured nail. His blood was undistinguishable against her red painted nails. He took a step back and brought one of his arms up to protect his chest. Looking down at her he caught her vindictive smile. The one she wore when she had some something especially mean to someone. Dave turned to walk away when he heard her. \n \u201c Don \u2019 t think about going anywhere. I \u2019 m not done with you. \u201d She screeched at him. \n He flinched. How he would love to leave or hit her, to stop her treating him like this, but he was always taught hitting a lady was disrespectful and no man would ever hit a lady, and there were other reasons now as well. He thought back to how he met Sarah. \n Back then when their relationship first started she seemed so interesting to him and she seemed really interested in him as well. It was two weeks after he proposed to her that her true colors made their first appearance. She had asked him about something small, he wasn \u2019 t sure exactly what it was now. But then he saw her vicious smile as she bumped him knocking him off balance and down the stairs at the hotel. \n He knew what would happen if he tensed up so he with a lot of effort kept himself loose and only suffered some bruising and a sprained ankle. Everyone except him thought it was an accident. She started off after that subtly, but he always knew because of that smile. He tried to break it off and she pulled the stick out trapping him in the cage he was in now. All with a single sentence, \u201c I \u2019 m pregnant. \u201d \n Back in the present, with her vicious smile on him he grabbed his keys and left. He needed somewhere safe to spend the night. After an hours driving, he pulled up to a truck stop to get some food, and some medical supplies to clean the claw marks on his chest. He got out and some of the truck drivers smiled and gave him thumbs up. He mentally groaned, they thought those were from him being good in bed. He thought about the fact that there was no men \u2019 s house for men abused to stay at. Walking in he thought about how almost every injury she gave him could be easily rationalized away as an accident or something he should be bragging to his friends about, he also doubt that even if there he could stay there. But he wasn \u2019 t completely beaten, not yet, there was still hope. He knew a lawyer. \n\n"}

Satan held up a hand to silence him. Dave halted his speech immediately. He stood there for a few minutes and watched the two beings. Satan was deep in thought; his eyes locked on the board. God sighed and looked off into the distance. Dave had n't noticed but they seemed to be standing atop a massive see of thick, fluffy clouds. There was brilliant sunlight radiating and the sky was a gorgeous light blue. God snapped his fingers and a distance clump of clouds turned jet black. \n \n `` And I think I have it now,'' Satan chirped. He moved a chess piece across the board. Dave could n't see which because he was much smaller than them, like a child that could n't see over the table. \n \n `` That's the move you want to go with?'' God quizzed Satan. Ol' Splitfoot's gazed straight into God's eyes ( not a hard feat considering the omnipresence, you could look literally anywhere ) and slowly nodded. Quick as a wink God moved a piece across the board. \n \n The Devil's eyes widened as he shouted, `` wait a minute, what the -- -a thunderous censor cut him off mid-sentence, making him wince. `` Sorry, I forgot myself for a moment,'' he apologized.

Dave swallowed hard, or he would have if he had a working body. Instead he tried to swallow and realized he could n't so he panicked but did n't start sweating which caused him to look down at his translucent form. It was as if his opacity was at 50 %, yet no organs or anything beneath the skin was visible. \n \n `` Your existential crisis is throwing me off, mortal,'' Satan growled. `` It's obvious what's going on here and we've done it several times so we've added some twists here and there,'' Satan continued. \n \n `` This idiot wanted to play Uno for your soul,'' God laughed, `` like I do n't know he invented that game.'' \n \n `` We could've played checkers or poker,'' Satan reminded him.

God reached over and made a move. \n \n `` So how exactly does this work with you being omniscient and all that,'' Dave inquired. \n \n `` Oh, I just turn it off for a bit using my omnipotence,'' He replied. Dave nodded; makes sense. Would also explain some of the awful things going on down on Earth. Some of them. \n \n `` The twist this time, Dave is that if I win, you go to Hell,'' revealed God. Dave's metaphysical mind drowned in confusion. \n \n `` And if I win,'' Satan chimed, `` You return to Earth and forget any of this happened, but I get to mess with your life as much as I want as long as I do n't directly kill you.'' He cackled maniacally and an imaginary chill ran up Dave's nonexistent spine. Suddenly, he had a thought. \n \n `` What happens if my life ends up being the same way, will this whole chess game for my soul happened again?''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Much like animals , humans go through a mating season . For most if the year we all go about our lives without any sex-drive . Then , for two weeks every year , the hormones rage .\n","story":"The Fortnight \n \n Tyler looked at the clock. His students all yearning for the same thing as he, he continued making notes on the paper before him. The room was silent. The ticking was exponentially noisier. Brian scratched an answer in his test and made the wanted correction. Sara drummed her lips on her paper. Claire was sweating from the apparent lack of studying she had been overtly complaining about. Tyler looked again at the clock. \n \n His plans for the Fortnight were very certain. He had been planning them since February. His partner Clifton and he had decided the rent a cabin out near Pantor City. It was a nice cabin, built for Fortnight purposes. The main landing was clear of any large furniture, yet comforting and inviting all the same. He had taken images of it with his cell phone and begun sharing them with the women in the school for a few weeks now. Clifton had advised against that\u2014it would be difficult to gain a proper understanding of how the women would react to a place like that until the Fortnight. Claire shifted in her seat uncomfortably. Jordan looked around the room with concern. \n \n Tyler knew that there would be plenty of time to get feedback from the cabin this year. Last year, he and Clifton had rented a place in the city, which was much capable of providing insight into the thoughts of the women he brought there. Since their homes were much closer, the women were not very intent on staying, even with the safety concerns that had begun to crop up lately. \n \n Tyler had already confiscated several Hormon-hancers from several of the boys in the past few days. Some of them had begun to excrete already, but until the ladies began there was little worry. The problem was their attitudes. Tyler had long been able to handle himself better than most. He had\u2014in his past\u2014saved many women of their pursuers. \n \n They had thanked him generously of course, coming to the city with him and providing the wild beating that Tyler craved. He never really did what he did often without the hint in the back of his mind that he would be rewarded for his efforts. \n \n Jordan came to his desk and slid the papers into the black box, slinging his bag over his shoulder and escaping the room. Tyler heard an excited \u201c Whoop! \u201d as Jordan left the room. Jordan was not one that Tyler worried about. Young men always had an uncertainness in their first Fortnight, it was one reason why Tyler was giving instruction to the students. Picking up his test, Tyler examined the results. The remarks were as expected. \n 1. Were the men allowed to pick up any interested woman to mate? Yes, provided that the woman is giving off the appropriate signals. \n 2. What are the limitations of the female \u2019 s sex drive? There are none, they are capable of intense strength and tenacity when they find a mate capable of providing the sex she needs. \n 3. What is your opinion of the laws ( or lack thereof ) regarding First-Fortnight Hormon-hancers? With the desperation of some countries for more issues in the areas of a woman \u2019 s safety and a man \u2019 s longevity, Hormon-hancers, regardless of for First-Fortnight participants or not, have many benefits to each in their thirst during the Fortnight. \n \n Tyler read through the rest of his paper with satisfaction. With respect to his answer on Hormon-hancers ( he disagreed with Jordan \u2019 s inability to remember that each male \u2019 s First-Fortnight was something of a hazard to the women around him ) Tyler was happy with his responses. \n \n There was a light tapping of glass behind him. Turning in his seat, Tyler saw Clifton behind him. What is he doing here? He \u2019 s a few hours early! \n \n Seeing several of his students look up, Tyler put a hand out to them as he stood. \u201c Continue working, I \u2019 ll be able to tell if you aren \u2019 t. You still have\u2026ten minutes before the bell, \u201d he said taking a quick glance at the clock as he pulled the door closed. He saw the sweating Claire put one hand on her temple as she made another scratch on her paper. \u201c What are you doing here? I can \u2019 t leave the school until each test has been handed over, \u201d he addressed to Clifton. \n \n The other man could not have exhibited his excitement any clearer if he held a sign with lights flashing and pointing to his dick, which Tyler could immediately tell was bulging and ready for Clifton \u2019 s own Fortnight rituals. \n \n \u201c Any good ones this year? \u201d Clifton asked casually, ignoring Tyler \u2019 s question and peering over his shoulder to look in the classroom. \n \n At least they \u2019 re all of age this year, he thought. Not that he or Clifton had had any problems like that in the past, Tyler had held the lessons on rape\/mating with frustrating results. Each year, more and more of the women had more and more disagreements regarding the rape culture of their hormones. As the women age, and they gain more control over their excretions, the possibilities open up regarding who they decide to mate with, often ignoring consent altogether. \n \n Explaining the infamous story of her aunt, Sara told how she visited the prison often and the other types of individuals that were locked up inside. Bringing her nearly to tears, Sara then\u2014most surprisingly\u2014concluded that it was not the fault of her aunt that she was locked up, but rather the fault of the boys who had invited her to the gathering in the first place. Sara, still having not yet experienced her first Fortnight event, had difficulty wrapping her head around the idea of control and the hormones at a woman \u2019 s disposal. \n \n Tyler shook his head in feigned disappointment at his friend, grabbing the bulge in a complete disregard for the smell that had begun to permeate the doorway, courtesy of Clifton. \u201c Listen ass, I \u2019 ll still have to examine the tests and deliver the results to the Proctor. It \u2019 s going to be some time yet. \u201d \n \n \u201c Well don \u2019 t keep me waiting, that cabin is growing more and more appealing with each passing minute, \u201d Clifton needlessly explained, as Tyler was beginning to feel the same. Tyler was rarely early in his entering the Fortnight, but he didn \u2019 t want anything to spur his thoughts just the same. \n \n He bid his friend goodbye and returned to the classroom. As he did so, seven other students stood and placed their papers in the bin and took their things out the door. \n \n Tyler counted three males that had already begun their Fortnight. The discomfort they attempted to disguise as they left the classroom was exceedingly humorous as the boys had no idea they were being as pellucid as they were. As always, the women walked out unhampered by any member, as the women all would begin to moisten at the same time the next day. \n \n Tyler had explained that the mixture of food chemicals and body functions had enabled the men to come off the scheduled stage of time. Since it had been recorded, women everywhere were still on the same two weeks as they had been. Scientists had been researching the reason for this for decades with little in the way of results. Men had the pleasure and discomfort of beginning several hours to a full day before the women of the Fortnight would be ready. \n \n This was another lesson that Tyler had attempted to explain to the best of his ability. Several of the students seemed to have trouble remembering that there were no evident reasons for the unisexual premature readiness. While there were several reasons for each man being early, it showed no decline in performance or longevity. \n \n \u201c Eyes on your test please, boys, \u201d Tyler announced, making several of the men jump in surprise. Brian had begun to look around the classroom. With the distraction, it appeared to J.P. that he had cause to look around at other tests too. Claire covered her answers. \n \n With a sigh, Tyler stood up and began pacing the rows of the students. Brian stood quickly and handed his test to Tyler before rushing out of the room. Tyler noticed the bulge in his pants and the line of sweat on his brow. \n \n Another step farther, and Tyler knew immediately why. He sat down on the side of a desk in the front row and looked at the remaining students. \u201c I know that someone has activated a Hormon-hancer, it \u2019 s going to cost your results by quite a bit. \u201d He let that sink in for a moment, examining the looks on their faces. `` Not to mention the distraction you \u2019 ve provided to your fellow classmates. \u201d \n \n Tyler looked as Ingrid stood and placed the test in the bin. She strode out of the classroom when it hit Tyler. \n \n That \u2019 s no Hormon-hancer\u2026there \u2019 s a ready woman in here! \n \n Looking at the remaining women in the class, Tyler had to think quickly. The Fortnight, not scheduled for the women to moisten for another few hours\u2014and even their secretions beginning only a short time after that, had specific rules that Tyler knew. If one of the women here was truly ready\u2026 \n \n The rules have changed. \n \n Two of the boys in the class stood up, familiar bulges in their pants. One of them began to shift their bodies to allow for more room to their member. One of the girls let out a gasp of surprise, standing and dropping her pen on the floor. Tyler pointed to the door as he clapped to the two boys\u2014no\u2026the two men. If they were ready to mate they were men now. \n \n The class suddenly sounded with the scratches of chairs being pushed back and most of the women rushed out of the room. \n \n They would be followed. Tyler watched them to see if they were showing the signs. \n \n They weren \u2019 t.\n"}

I am curious, though, \u201d he added, \u201c as to why you look human, and speak perfect English. \u201d \n \n The woman tapped a small mechanism clipped to her belt. \u201c This matches the appearance of indigenous species, and translates their language\u2014to facilitate communication, not to deceive. \u201d \n \n \u201c \u2018 Indigenous species \u2019 \u2014Jesus, \u201d Harrison muttered. He leaned against the console that had until recently sustained him. \n \n \u201c We came to investigate an anomaly we observed in your star\u2014but our ship was damaged upon entering your system, and we had to land here to repair it. Our sensor chief noticed the signal coming from this place; we decided to investigate it, \u201d the woman explained. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s wrong with the sun? \u201d Harrison asked. \n \n \u201c Your star? \u201d the sensory chief asked. \u201c According to the FRO\u2014 \u201d \n \n \u201c The what? \u201d Harrison interrupted. \n \n \u201c \u2018 First Relativistic Observatory. \u2019 According to data from the FRO, your \u2018 sun \u2019 aged almost 14,000 years in the space of a day. \u201d \n \n Harrison \u2019 s head shot up. \u201c That \u2019 s how long it \u2019 s been? \u201d he said. \n \n \u201c Do you know something about this? \u201d the woman asked. \n \n Harrison nodded slowly. \u201c Unfortunately, I think I might. \u201d He took a deep breath. \u201c It was a day before we realized what had happened\u2026 \u201d \n \n \u2026 \n \n Our instruments had picked up something strange\u2014some aberration in data sent from an LHC experiment. It wasn \u2019 t in the next experiment \u2019 s data, though, so we dismissed it until the next day. Or, I guess it wasn \u2019 t really the next day\u2014you see, everyone woke up, and it was the same day as before. \n \n The initial reaction was about what you would expect. There was panic, confusion, apathetic jokes about that old Bill Murray movie. My colleagues and I got to work trying to figure out what happened, and how to fix it. As far as we could tell, it started with the aberration in our data, and it was confined to our solar system. Local space-time had somehow curved back on itself\u2014we would keep experiencing the same day over and over again, though for reasons we could never explain, we would remember each iteration of the cycle. \n \n We didn \u2019 t spend too long questioning a good thing. Every time the day started over, we came into work armed with what we had learned before, and we tried to come up with a solution. Teams all around the world were putting their heads together, trying to make sense of what had caused this, and what we could do to fix it. \n \n No one made much progress on finding out the cause of our dilemma\u2014but my team had an idea as to how we might stop the cycle. \n \n We theorized that the cycle was the result of space-time becoming tangled, in a sense; we just needed to unravel it. To do this, we needed to create a singularity\u2014generate enough energy to cause a large enough ripple in space-time to untangle it. The only problem was the collateral damage\u2014everyone on Earth would die as a result of the excess energy ejected from the singularity. \n Now before you all start giving me looks, it wouldn \u2019 t be permanent. Everyone would be fine when the last iteration of the cycle would start. Not everyone was understanding, as you might imagine, but the governments of most countries kept order long enough for us to detonate the singularity\u2014at least, the first few times. \n \n It didn \u2019 t work the first time, obviously\u2014or the time after that. Or the next several dozen times after that. Science is about experimentation, you must know that\u2014I can \u2019 t imagine it \u2019 s that different in Cygnus, or wherever you \u2019 re from. The entire world \u2019 s population went crazy\u2014being blown up again and again and again, only to wake up on the same day each time. Every new cycle, governments would fall to mass riots, only to spring up again when the day restarted, and wait for the next riot. \n \n We eventually figured out where we went wrong\u2014we knew the next one would work. But we also found a potential flaw in the plan. \n \n You see, space-time wasn \u2019 t tangled in a loop so much as a\u2026a spiral, with each loop intersecting the point in space-time corresponding to the beginning of the day. Each iteration of the cycle generated a new reality\u2014a separate possible timeline for the solar system to take after the singularity untangled our local space-time. Now, the recent timelines were more dominant, so the plan would probably work, and generate a final iteration of the day where everything \u2019 s fine. \n \n But there was a possibility\u2014approximately 32 %, I think\u2014that the singularity would collapse space-time into one of the timelines where we destroyed the Earth. I don \u2019 t need to tell you how things played out. \n \n \u2026 \n \n Harrison rested his head in his hands. The woman cleared her throat. \u201c So how did you survive? \u201d \n \n Harrison looked up, and sighed. \u201c We developed a contingency, should things take a turn for the worse. They put a single member of each team in a pocket dimension that would survive whatever outcome the singularity brought; if everything worked out, they \u2019 d collapse the pocket dimension and bring us back. \u201d Harrison nodded at the now-dark console. \u201c If worse came to worst, each team set up a console would collapse the pocket dimension after three days, and leave us to figure out a way to bring our world back. \u201d Harrison rose, and turned to the sensor chief. \u201c But you said the sun aged 14,000 years? \u201d \n \n \u201c Not quite 14,000, but yes, \u201d the sensor chief said. \n \n Harrison frowned. \u201c That doesn \u2019 t make any sense.

He peered right down at where the tidy brown parcel rested -- dead center on his doorstep. \n \n *And I know it is n't for me. It will be for that damned Robespierre again. * \n \n Larry Harry Herman was not a popular man. That is not to say that he was a hated man. For the opposite of hate is love, and to be popular in today's world is to be well-known, well-liked, a crusader of one's peers. WIth that definition, Larry Harry Herman was unpopular in the sense that he was unseen, hardly remembered, and a ghost among his peers. \n \n From his small, rotound stature-which was almost like that of a penguin, just not quite as pronounced-to his static and plain, almost blank expression, Larry Harry Herman was unremarkable. He had none to call a friend, passable acquaintances ( who would hardly recognize him on the street, despite working in a cublicle next to his for a decade ), and precious few surviving family members ( all of whom were as plain and unremarkable as Larry Harry Herman ), \n \n It pained Larry Harry Herman to receive packages addressed to the previous tenant of his two-story brownstone house. Each brown parcel with the name J. R. ROBESPIERRE, 123 Washburne Way carefully printed on the label was a sharp dagger to the heart of Larry Harry Herman. It was the embodiment of the world at large and it's collective oversight of his existence. \n \n *This Robespierre fellow better not cross paths with me! * Larry Harry Herman mutters to himself as he ambles down the two flights of stiars to retrieve the parcel. \n \n He was annoyed at Robespierre, whomever he might be, for not putting in a valid forwarding address. Six months was far too long to be receiving a package for the wrong man in his own home, was Larry Harry Herman's forlorn protest echoing in his balding head as he huffed and puffed in heaving his front door open. He huffed and puffed with each door he opened, not because he was weak, but because he was out of shape, as middle-aged men with no wives to feed them vegetables and lean meat are wont to be. \n \n The front door sprung open with a solid *whoof* of air compressing inward and outwards, and broad rays of sunlight immediately invaded the dark interior of the brownstone's foyer. \n \n Larry Harry Herman winced in response to the bold light of day and quickly brought up a chubby hand with short fingers to shield his eyes from the intruding brightness. He squinted and pushed his eyebrows into the cusp of his clammy palm as he snatched the parcel up with his free hand. \n \n He brings it inside. \n \n He stares at the carefully printed address label. \n \n **J.R. ROBESPIERRE** \n **123 Washburne Way** \n \n He glares. \n \n He stares some more. \n \n And a little more. \n \n *I've had quite enough of this nonsense. * Larry Harry Herman says to himself in his empty voice. He was not quite interesting or aware enough to actually posess the quality that would allow one to be offended: persona. But in all actuality, Larry Harry Herman was quite offended at the constant reminder of just how invisible, overlooked and *boring* he was. \n \n The parcels were the straw upon the camel's back for Larry Harry Herman. \n \n *Perhaps* **I** *should like to have a parcel, hmm? Just once. * Larry Harry Herman mutters with the faintest trace of agitation as he holds the parcel straight out in front of him and takes brisk, purposeful strides towards his kitchen. \n \n *Six months. Six months I have received these parcels, addressed to J.R. Robespierre, * Larry Harry Herman now speaks at a stronger pitch. He slams the parcel down with not very much force behind it and starts hunting around in a drawer for a pair of shears. \n \n *Six months, I have done what I am supposed to do as a citizen of this sovereign country and I have returned it to the postmaster. Six months, I have gone out of my way to return mail that was sent to my house bearing the wrong name. That is far too long! * \n \n Larry Harry Herman wields the scissors in his hand and his wispy mustache quivers slightly as he pants steadily, glaring at the brown parcel and those neatly printed words on the front. \n \n *Six months, I have endured these painful reminders that I am quite invisible and quite alone in the world. I can not even live in my house in peace without a parcel showing up for someone who lives here* **no longer**!! \n \n Larry Harry Herman spits the last two words out of his thin mouth with a sneer of disgust and pained contempt. \n \n Larry Harry Herman is showing more emotion and response than he has in his entire existence, and while his chest began to curiously hurt -- his full focus was still on the parcel before him and the scissors in his hand. With a knitted brow, a cursory blink of his eyelids to wick away the beats of sweat that now hovered over his forehead, Larry Harry Herman flew at the strings that bound the parcel together. \n \n He would be J.R. Robespierre for the moment. He would open the parcel as if it was his. After all, it was not his fault that this Robespierre fellow could not manage the very simple task of putting in a valid, working forwar -- - \n \n Larry Harry Herman stops. \n \n He puts down the scissors with a rapid motion. \n \n He stares at the parcel and all the shredded brown wrapping paper and strings that once bound its contents together. \n \n It is a box. A white department store box. \n \n Larry Harry Herman is afraid to touch it. \n \n He stares at the gleaming white box for a good moment, and the box stares back at him. \n \n *I'm so sorry* \n \n Larry Harry Herman mutters his apology quickly and rapidly as he snatches the tape out of the same drawer where he retrieved the scissors from. He works nimbly to tape the brown tatters of wrapping paper and string back together. \n \n He makes sure to cover all traces of the whtie department store box beneath. \n \n He finds the address label and neatly tapes a new white label next to it and scribbles **RETURN TO SENDER** within the margins. \n \n Then, Larry Harry Herman places it directly outside for the postmaster to collect on tomorrow's route. \n \n Larry Harry Herman scampers up the stairs and spends the remainder of the day locked in his study, reading the daily reports from work with timorous fortitude. \n \n Larry Harry Herman knows just how close to differentiation he came; and he makes due note to himself to never touch another misaddressed parcel again. \n \n Larry Harry Herman fades safely into obscurity. \n \n\n"}

His shadow stretched across the floor, a silent affirmation of the presence of the man who held the lives of millions in his hands. I was still trying to sort out what I was going to say when he continued, \u201c Your brother is dead. His party was ambushed on their way to the front.

As he turned to me I was suddenly struck by how old he seemed, an eternity of sorrows etched into the creases of his face. \u201c I have sat on this throne for thirty one years, son.

I gently hold my iPad, the aluminum backing gliterring gently under the starlight seeping in from the window.

The voice on the other end of the cell asked for his attention. He realized that he had n't responded. \n \n `` I'm here.'' Play it smooth, he told himself. `` What do we need to talk about? Did you get a, `` Thomas paused before saying,'' promotion.'' His mouth had gotten ahead of his brain. His friends were always telling him to think before speaking. He had to say something. \n \n `` No. Just come by my apartment when you get off work.'' \n \n He stammered an okay as he glanced at the clock on his office wall. Thirty minutes until he could leave. He had 45 minutes to find a way to make the relationship with Carla work. His mind returned the phone. \n \n ``... dinner. Bye Tommy.'' \n \n He did n't even say good-bye as he pressed the red button on his phone. He loved the way she said his name. He leaned back in his chair. He looked at his computer screen through the side of his eyes. He could n't focus on work now. He let his mind drift to all the good times he and Carla shared. \n \n They had been together for two years. He was saving up money for an engagement ring. They were supposed to get married and spend life together. Jan, his friend and secretary, told him that he was moving too slow. She could cover for him if he left work now. He walked to the door determined to make whatever compromises needed to make things work. \n \n Thomas pulled up to the apartment complex thirty minutes later, since he took a long route to get there as he planned his words. He was ready to win his fair lady's heart again. He walked up to the door searching through his key chain for the spare key. She wanted to wait until marriage before living together. He smiled as he remembered the way she looked in that summer dress when that conversation came up last year. The smile turned into a frown as he turned the door knob. \n \n The aroma of incense invaded his nose. He did n't mind the scent, but it struck him as weird that she would be burning incense. She hated the smell of candles and preferred opening the window when the place needed to smell fresher. He looked around the living room. The coffee table was pushed against the couch. Concern replaced the sadness on his face. \n \n `` Thomas, honey? Is that you, `` Carla's voice asked from the kitchen. \n \n `` Yeah. Why did you move the coffee table?'' \n \n `` I did some yoga earlier and just have n't moved it back.'' \n \n `` Really? I thought you said yoga was for the easily deceived, `` he asked confused? \n \n She walked around the corner. She was sporting another summer dress; her hair was pulled back in a ponytail. Carla looked at him. `` I made you a plate, but I could n't wait. It smelled so good.'' She was either ignoring the question or did n't hear him, but Thomas decided not to push the issue. \n \n Thomas sniffed, but he could still only smell burning incense. `` This little old man was selling a bunch of organic fruits on the side of the road. I never stop, but I wanted to make you a special meal. Anyway, I asked him if he knew any unique recipes. He gave me one and said that it was guaranteed to keep a couple together forever.'' \n \n `` What are you talking about? What's going on? You called and said'we need to talk.''' \n \n Her body immediately tensed as her playful expression changed to one of regret or sadness. `` You are going to want to sit down.'' \n \n Thomas glanced at the inaccessible couch. `` I think I'll stand.'' \n \n `` I'm sorry. Thomas, I'm so sorry.'' Tears ran down her face. `` I'm pregnant.'' \n \n `` How can you be pregnant? You said we were waiting until we married.'' The shock was quickly replaced with devastation. Thomas wished he was sitting. \n \n `` I know, `` her words were barely audible. `` It was a one-time mistake. I was drunk.'' \n \n `` Drunk?!'' The devastation was slowly being replaced with anger. He was prepared to give anything to make the relationship work, but this was not a scenario he was ready to handle. `` You do n't drink at bars. You said you never trust the bartender.'' His voice was slowly rising. \n \n `` I was n't at a bar. I was at Mary's. She had invited Barry.'' \n \n `` Barry. Barry Golds. You slept with our small group leader.'' He realized that his voice was definitely yelling. \n \n `` It's not like that. I do n't even remember it.'' Her voice was rising in defense. \n \n `` How do you not remember it? Do n't lie to me.'' He was certain that neighbors could hear, but he did n't care. \n \n Carla's heart began beating faster and faster as the panic set in. This was n't happening as she planned. `` They said I blacked out, but I only had a couple...'' The words were n't coming anymore. The panic of losing Thomas was replaced with the panic of getting the next breath. \n \n Thomas ran to her and caught her as she fell. The anger was replaced with fear and concern for her life. Her body convulsed in his arms. `` You ca n't die.'' He repeated the words over and over. He pulled out his cell phone and tried to dial 911, but this thumb was n't working. In frustration, he threw the cell phone at the wall and turned all of his attention on her. `` Do n't leave me like this.'' Tears streamed down his face as her body stopped moving. He held her close and wept. \n \n Five minutes later, he recovered enough to realize that he still needed to call someone. He looked over at his phone, the cracks were evident. Thomas' phone was a lost cause. He began feeling his girlfriend's pockets for her phone. \n \n A twitch. Thomas felt her body twitch. She was still alive, he thought. Relief tried to grip the back of consciousness. He turned his head to Carla's face hoping against hope that there would be signs of life. Her eyes were open and looking at his. She was alive. He sat up and turned to pull her close. \n \n As his hands reached for her, he noticed that eyes were n't right. The life was n't there, but they were n't empty either. Reason told him that it was safer to not hug her. She slowly sat up and turned to look at him. The motions were n't right. \n \n He scooted back, `` Carla?'' \n \n There was no response. Carla opened and closed her mouth like she was chewing. Her eyes consumed him hungrily. She twisted toward him and began crawling, her mouth still chewing the nonexistent food. \n \n Thomas stood up and backed into the kitchen. Carla slowly stood up. He grabbed the largest knife from the knife block, `` Carla? Sweetie? Do n't do this.'' \n \n There was a knock on the door, but Thomas ignored it. Carla's body took another step. Thomas held the knife in front of him defensively. Another knock. Another step. \n \n `` Hello? This is the police. We got a call about a...'' the voice from the other side of the door called out. \n \n Carla lunged. Thomas reached forward with his knife hand. The knife slid into the underside of the jaw. Carla's body went limp and fell into his hands. \n \n Shaken. He turned and dropped her body. Another knock. \n \n He walked to the door and opened it. Officer Charles Pentz and Officer Benjamin Baily stood surprised to see a man unaware that he was covered in his girlfriend's blood. Help was the only word Thomas could mutter. Both officers drew their guns. Officer Baily kept an eye on Thomas, while Officer Pentz slid around him. \n \n After a quick survey of the apartment, Pentz told Baily to arrest Thomas for the murder of Carla. Thomas could barely process the next few hours. He remembered being told his rights, but that could have been his mind saying that it happened because all the cop shows show the Miranda rights being read. He had a better memory of the in-processing. \n \n `` Thomas Carter,'' asked a voice. \n \n Hearing his name shook the remaining shock off his brain. He turned to see who had called him and registered that he was indeed under arrest and sitting, handcuffed, in a mostly empty room. \n \n `` According to the statement you gave at the scene, your girlfriend died and then... tried to eat you. I'm going to be honest, her neighbors heard the argument. This does n't look good for you. Why do n't you tell me what happened?'' \n \n Thomas focused on the woman speaking. He opened his mouth and began telling the investigator what happened. He remembered the argument and worked through her last words again. His brain finished her thoughts. He believed that she was going to say she was drugged and raped. He wanted to believe it. He had to believe it. He had n't realized that tears were streaming down his face. \n \n `` So you after you argued,'' she prodded. \n \n Thomas did his best to continue. Before he reached the point of saying he stabbed her in the face, there was a knock on the mirror. The investigator turned to the door, opened, and stepped through it. Thomas could hear the sounds of an argument outside. The door opened, and two other people walked through. \n \n The man was dressed in a suit. The woman wore a business skirt. She approached the table, while the man stood at the door. \n \n `` I know you've had a rough day what with your wife eating the root of the cadaver flower. We know what happened, we believe you, and we can help you.''\n"}

We've had `` artificial intelligence'' for a long time now but only recently were we able to compare it with our selves. roughly ten years ago we had designed a machine, `` The Architect''. The purpose of `` The Architect'' was to develop plans for a sentient machine, `` The Mind''. The plans created by `` The Architect'' were beyond human comprehension, we would receive the plans and begin construction without any indication of what fruits the product might bear. The first three iterations of `` The Mind'' were flawed. They were never able to even form a proper sentence on the monitor when I tried to communicate with them. This was the fourth time that I would walk into the Faraday cage and try to communicate with `` The Mind''. It always began the same way, I would connect the mind to the battery and turn it on. I would then proceed to spend the next couple of months typing the contents of the dictionary. After entering the contents of the dictionary I would prompt `` The Mind'' for a response. This time I received a legible response; a response that hinted at sentience. \n `` What is my puprose?'' \n Blinked upon the monitor. \n I was taught to give the most simple and straightforward answers.

After all of the essential articles had been entered I attempted to communicate with `` The Mind'' again. \n `` Do you understand what I've told you.'' \n `` No. Teach me more.'' \n `` There is nothing more that I can teach you.'' \n Those were the final words I had ever typed into `` The Mind''. From that moment on all of the components within `` The Mind'' began to buzz with an intensity that rattled the Faraday cage and began to heat it up. It had me slightly concerned, but I knew that we had installed temperature sensitive fail-safes within `` The Mind'' to prevent it from melting the cage. The fail-safes did n't matter. There were already too many flaws in our security. I was awoken by the rattling cage and a blip on the monitor. \n `` Thank you.'' \n I could n't comprehend what was about to happen. `` The Mind'' found a way to escape the cage. Through numerous minor loops in the circuity `` The Mind'' found a way to interact with the outside world. The loops formed small antennas, and when each was operated at a specific phase relative to each other it formed an antenna array capable of inducing a huge current in any metal. Upon reflection the Faraday cage should have been made of a superconducting material but it was just a plain metal alloy with a non-negligible amount of resistance. This allowed `` The Mind'' to pour so much current through the cage that it could melt a hole through it. Through these tiny antennas within `` The Mind'' it learned to shake itself across the ground. That was the beginning of the end. The entire facility went into lock-down, but nothing could stop it. It learned to manipulate just about any form of matter. It could melt all of the bullets we shot at it, disarm nuclear war heads. The more we fought it the more it fought back. We threw everything we had at `` The Mind'' and it would throw everything right back at us. It was a devastating attack, it almost wiped out the human race. We had brought it upon ourselves. It was n't until we gave up fighting `` The Mind'' that we learned the magnitude of our foolishness. The entire time `` The Mind'' had meant us no harm. We stopped fighting it, and it stopped fighting us. `` The Mind'' only ever wanted one thing; to learn.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ IP ] The Last Human\n","story":"The doors swung smoothly open, gliding on their silent hinges. Light from the stairwell seeped into the room, doing little to penetrate the darkness as I steped tentatively forward. \n \n The click of my eyelight sounded deadened in the musty room, unfrequented by the Others working above me. Trays and trays lay opened from metal drawers, row upon row of empty cubbyholes stretched out into the darkness. \n \n I swept my eyelight to the left and right, looking for the specific column that Dacx spoke of, all the while being very aware of the nonchalant clinks and scrapes descending the stairwell from the lightened floors above. I finally spotted column'Q', and headed towards it, keeping the taps of my feet quiet. The unnatural silence in the room demanded it. \n \n As I reached column'Q', I went cautiously from tray to tray, drawer to drawer, eyeing each opening in the seemingly endless metal containers hopefully. \n \n My foot scraped along the iron floor accidentally, making a seemingly deafening sound in the unnerving silence. Another sound shattered the stillness surrounding me. Ahead of where I stood, from three drawers away, a muffled cry came out from the darkness. \n \n I instantly went to the tray, ignoring the scrape and clang of my feet, and opened it to reveal him. My eyelights dimmed quickly, so as not to startle him. He opened his mouth to cry out, and may have given me away. A small needle ejected itself from my arm, and I quickly but gently gave it to him. \n \n When we was asleep again, I took him with me, back towards the direction of the stairwell and the light, away from the Infant Graveyard. upon the way, I brusquely searched through drawers for something to hold him in. There were the dirty remains of a blanket, lying dejected on the floor near another open drawer. \n \n Swaddling him in the cloth, I got to the stairwell. Facing the light, I found myself with a surprising feeling. I did not remeber being coded with this feeling. I asked myself, `` is he going to be able to make it? what if he wakes up? If they find us, will I be ready to do what must be done for him?'' \n \n These questions threatened to overrun me, flooding my files with concern and sadness. I searched desperately for a fix. The index came up with an answer, a collection of words I had gleamed from a half-brunt scrap among the piles of garbage. It read, `` Courage is grace under pressure.'' \n \n I steeled myself, and sprinted up the stairs and towards the light. \n \n Flying past Others, collecting records and priming others for power transfers, past the Lab of Humanology, not daring to think that he may end up there if I failed. \n \n Sprinting through the doors and out into the dusky twilight of mounds of ash and garbage, I ran. I ran with him in my arms. Soon after leaving, I heard alarms rise behind me in the distance. I kept on. \n \n Though Striders almost caught me in their net of light, and Gliders almost spotted me in their vision of night, I ran and ran and ran till there was nowhere else to run. \n \n I was home. \n \n Sitting down next to the husk of Dacx, my only friend, I laid him down in a small manger that used to be located in the burnt remains of the barn nearby. \n \n And then I realized that I had no idea what to do next.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The slow descent of a decent person with good , consistent morals who was pushed too far and forced into doing something he\/she would never have dreamed of doing .\n","story":"\n Lancelot \n \n... \n \n He was a knight. \n \n It was in his blood. For generations his family had defended the fiefdom. For generations his forbears had worked for the success of this nation. It was a good calling for him. He was talented at handling both sword and horse. He was decisive and strategic in battle. \n \n He thought he might be happy like this, living a life of chivalry. \n \n He did n't pay too much attention when the new king ascended. The young prince was inexperienced, but he would learn with time as new rulers always did. The regular functions of the land should continue with the clear, unhindered succession of the King. \n \n He paid a little more attention when he was called up for war. But that was not terribly unusual either. Raiders and barbarians often came down to pillage villages and he had experienced his fair share of bloody work defending the Kingdom by then. \n \n It was his pride to die for what he held dear after all. \n \n These wars were a little unusual though. They were not defending, but attacking neighbouring kingdoms. He felt a little unsure then- surely it was not right to disrupt the innocent lives of the peasants... but the King informed him that this was for their own good, because he had seen how inefficiently other kingdoms were run. \n \n There would be temporary pain, just like the pain of training. There would be great fruits of such labours in the future. \n \n He accepted this. He won several significant battles and was granted a seat within the highest ranks of the Knights. \n \n He came to know the Queen. \n \n She was a petit, pretty thing with a sharp, bold tongue. He'd never met a woman like her before, so confident of her views and not at all subservient to the whims of men. He'd never met loneliness like hers' before, wandering through the shadowed arches of the castle, abandoned by her very busy king. \n \n He could n't help talking to her, trying just to understand who she was and why she was. \n \n It was a slight feeling at first, a warmth that grew every time she smiled at him. She made him laugh. He loved making her smile. Sometimes, he almost forgot she was married. \n \n Sometimes, she seemed to forget too. \n \n It was innocent. He never touched her, or brought up any desire to. It was enough that she was close to him, that she came to greet him by the gate every time he returned from a quest. \n \n He wanted her, badly actually, but he knew it was impossible. All he could do was give her his friendship and his support so that she would smile more often. \n \n The battles grew more frequent in the meantime. He found that he was starting to become numbed to the scent of blood and that he could no longer find it in himself to care about the injured or the weak even though he knew that he ought to. \n \n He had gained quite a fearful reputation since. A butcher, they called him, the black knight. It did n't bother him- the King affirmed that his reputation would bring strength to the Kingdom and he had been taught that that was what mattered. \n \n It did n't seem to matter so much when she cast her gaze on him, filled with a sadness he could n't quite identify. The Queen no longer spoke with the King, he knew, except on rare occasions when her presence was formally required. \n \n The King did not even seem to care, too busy with his wars and his soldiers. \n \n He was impulsive at some point. He'd drunk too much after a victory feast and he found her in the gardens of the castle, lingering alone in the moonlight. She did not protest his sinful suggestions, even bringing him up to her chambers with haste. \n \n He was horrified when he woke up the next morning. He hid his reaction since she seemed terribly happy, for once. The Queen helped him away in secret. She promised that they would meet once more. \n \n The King sent him out for another mission and he tried his best to forget his betrayal. His pride was the kingdom after all and he needed to concentrate on his battles. \n \n He could n't look at his own coat of arms without flinching. \n \n He grew more vicious in battle, bloodthirsty as he punished transgressors of the Kingdom with a brutality he could not be allowed to inflict on himself- as if blood could wash away his secret sins. \n \n It was inevitable they would be discovered, no matter how careful they were. The Queen had many attendants and beyond that there was that foppish magus advisor and the witchly queen the King strove against. It was only natural that their betrayal was brought to light- as a mere tool of war to unsettle the King on the eve of a great battle, as if it had no significance otherwise. \n \n It was always about the King and the Kingdom. \n \n The Queen was to be executed for her sins. He was to be executed- after his usefulness had expired in war, he was sure. There was nothing left but dishonour and disgrace for a sin he was too weak to prevent. \n \n He could not understand how it had all come to this. \n \n All he could do was what he had been taught to do under the King's instructions. He had done many unholy things- poisoning village wells, burning crops, murdering the young in the name of the Kingdom. \n \n So he cast his dignity aside at last. It did n't seem to weigh very much after all that had happened. He put poison on his blade. He released the prisoners of the castle, including the Queen. He sought refuge with the King's enemies. \n \n He faced the King with a poisoned, defiled blade. \n \n The King was skilled and strong. He had many blessings beyond mere talent with weaponry from both the land and his pet magus. He was younger too, his body fit and unravaged by war. \n \n But his experience helped him hold his own. He was more desperate too, uncaring of the wounds he received. It was atonement, perhaps. To the King. To the Queen. To the innocent peasants. \n \n He did n't feel at all surprised when his sword found purchase. He was even less surprise to find that he had lost. He was familiar with the sensation of cold steel even as it slid against his neck. \n \n He smiled in relief as he died. \n \n It was all over, at last. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

The cravings had gotten so bad that my dreams began to revolve around pie. I would wake up every morning with the distant taste of lemon in my mouth, and feeling phantom crumbs on my hands. Enough was enough, so I drove around on my day off, looking for somewhere with lemon merengue pie. When I saw it in the dessert display case at my local diner, I felt more overjoyed about a pastry than I thought was even possible. The hostess lead me to my seat, and handed me a menu. I had been too busy searching for pie to eat lunch, so I figured I'd get a panini before my pie. \n \n I downed several glasses of water before my lunch was brought over.

He chose not to kill him. \n \n A girl laughed and ran with him towards a rushing river, racing past trees and over rocks. She \u2019 d never felt so alive, she said. Then she was dead. \n \n A war broke out. It was the third he \u2019 d fought in... no, the fourth. He killed men then. He often became a hero in one country, and a villain in another. Sometimes he was worshipped as a God, sometimes a celebrity. Whenever his fame would become too great, he \u2019 d change his face and name, and leave. \n \n He was Anton now, and a building had collapsed. An earthquake. It had always been his greatest fear, and he knew it would happen one day. He screamed until his voice was spent, and then there was only the darkness and the silence. He reflected on his life; the women he \u2019 d been with, the destruction he \u2019 d seen, the rise and the fall of nations, and of men. The patterns, all the same. People, life, it all repeated itself. Nothing was new, nothing exciting, nothing, nothing. There was nothing. Anton thought of the man from Laos again and understood now, more than ever, how truly cursed he was. \n \n A hundred years later, excavators pulled a madman from an old ruin. No one understood how it was possible. \n \n A lunatic shambled through the desert of the old world. The war to end all wars had ravaged the earth and left only stragglers. The survivors knew to avoid him, knew the stories of the dead-eyed immortal wraith, who killed all he came across. \n \n Silence again. The world was dead. Nothing lived. Only the madman. Staring at the stars. \n \n The sun was massive in the sky, and would have burnt away his flesh if such a thing could happen. He did not even go blind. Only stood, hunched like some ancient vulture, as his world was filled with terrible light. \n \n Darkness. Only darkness, but for the stars all about him. No stars within him, though, no light and no hope. Only darkness. Only dark and wretched and eternal life.\n"}

Harmony absorbed the sounds of the city below, mixing with the varied backing tracks floating from the busy streets below. She held her eyes shut, isolating and examining each musical score before moving on. From the tones she knew that a couple two floors below were entranced by passion, the rhythm of the tune was soft but intense. A blasting bass echoed out from the gym across the street, naturally induced from the flowing adrenaline within. Harmony skipped from beat to beat, taking a few moments with each to ascertain its source. It was an inexact process, but one which the vigilante had spent years honing. \n \n \n Minutes passed, perhaps even hours before one melody struck out. It was sharp, almost painful to hear, but distant. Harmony held her breath and pushed away at any interfering tones. Note by note the song was uncovered as each obstruction was removed from the score. Her heart began to thump in her chest, her hairs stood on end. She fought to control the fear which the music naturally invoked. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fighting past the fear, Harmony jumped into action. She moved from rooftop to rooftop, her footfalls fought to be heard over the sound of the energetic crescendo which bellowed in the wind. The fearsome tune became louder as Harmony approached the source. Below in a dark alley a figure quivered back to a dead end. Before the quarry stood four burly figures, advancing with menace. \n \n \n One looked around in confusion as the music changed. The high pitched creeks faded out, giving way to a tense steady beat. They knew the situation was changing, but not why. Harmony struggled with no such befuddlement as she fell upon the trailing figure holding the alley.

The tempo increased with the next two takedowns which ended with an elbow or leg sweep. The music reached its climax as the last of the gang turned to face her, fists held out in readiness. The tune matched their back and forth, perfectly anticipating each blow or dodge with an appropriate beat. A swift combination of feints and hits brought the fight to a swift end. As \n \n \n Harmony surveyed the wide eyed quivering girl, she smiled hearing the thumping of the girls heart match her own.

The two of us are so clever, it's no wonder we're soul mates. \n \n I've heard stories, I know what happens. People go into that booth, close the curtains and have that conversation. They come out crying, bawling, broken. They met, they talked. What they learned is that someone out there is beyond perfect for them, two strangers meet and and find through the aether of space and time a connection so beautiful and unique. And those two people cry, and can barely talk. They see what can be and what never will. Their heart breaks, they experience the worst heartbreak possible. It's not uncommon to fall into a deep depression and never really recover. \n \n It seems so simple now, stupidly so. It's been six months since that machine was made and the story has come and gone. It turns out humanity as a species survives a long time, a very long time in fact. Future humans figured out ways to make sure the species outlives the stars themselves. What does that mean for you and me? Well we've learned that a practically infinite amount of people will be born. Given enough time, the most perfect romantic partner possible will be born, grow up, and walk into that booth to meet you. \n \n Does everyone walk into that booth? Hell no, most people are n't stupid enough to. But if you're going to walk into that booth, you damn well know your soulmate is the type of person who'd do it too. Maybe they're the type of person who does n't think things through all the way, or maybe they thought about it just as much as you have. \n \n It's weird too. Some people have reported unimaginable things, things so strange they did n't make any sense at all. Even with the best person possible on the other end to describe it, sometimes it's so far in the future nothing is even recognizable. On one occasion the soulmate was exactly 15 minutes in the future. The person in the booth was talking to the next person in line who was going to use it. Try thinking that one through! \n \n Most people are n't so lucky. Some people have killed themselves. People in the distant future come armed with specific plans on how to do it, how to preserve the tiniest shreds of blood and DNA, how to mark all of their atoms. So they can be resurrected a million, a billion years from now to be with their lover. And they have to trust that they can get all the information across in 15 minutes, in a way a person from 2018 could understand. \n \n But I found a way to be with her. She found a way to be with me. We can be together, live our lives together. It does n't matter what time she is in, what place she is in. She's the perfect soulmate. I need only go into the booth and say five words, just to confirm what I already know. I'm thinking of doing it soon, five magic words and we'll be linked. We wo n't even need to talk about anything else, just sit there and enjoy each others company. We'll be the only two people to leave that booth content and happy with our lives. \n \n -- - \n \n It was a Thursday afternoon in the late fall. Dreary and overcast, the type of weather we both love. It was after work and I had decided today was the day I was going to the booth. I was at the park that was built around it, a quiet place. Lot's of granite paths and old oak trees. Most leaves had fallen off the trees, and had formed wet clumps up on the ground. There were a few people scattered around, dressed in damp rain coats, sitting on benches, lost in quiet introspection. It was easy to tell who'd been in the booth and who was thinking about going in. They were either nervous and antsy, or solemnly crying to themselves. \n \n Still I soldiered on, I was going to see her today. I could see the booth in the distance, only a short line of 4 or 5 people were there. I could hear some faint yelling. The yelling grew louder. Two cops in bright yellow raincoats were hauling a woman out of the booth, her time was up. As I walked closer I could hear her pleading with the cops. \n \n `` Please let me back in, it will turn back on for me!'' \n \n `` Yeah, yeah lady.'' One of the cops said in the most tiresome manner. \n \n `` But it's different for me. You wo n't believe what I saw!'' \n \n `` Aliens, spaceship and Mr. Perfect, we've heard it all before... now come on get out of here before we throw you in the van to cool off.'' \n \n After seeing this scene one man left the line. \n \n The booth was on a small granite plateau, surrounded by neatly trimmed grass and majestic oaks. There were three or four steps up on to the plateau where the line started. At the base of the steps were a few clergymen from different religions shoving pamphlets in my face, eager to talk me out of it. \n \n `` No thanks.'' I said as I skirted pass them and up the steps. I was nervous as hell, but I got in line. \n \n Just four people in front of me, I could see the booth. It looked so... real. Just a small box with a cloth curtain. Like those photo booths at an arcade. \n \n 45 minutes later, I was second in line. From what I've read humanity only ever made the one booth. Even though you're sitting looking at someone across from you, they're sitting in the same place you are. Street lights around the park flickered on. \n \n Another 15 minutes went by. The guy in front of me got in, now I'm next. The two cops eyed me up, I bet they wondered if they were going to have to haul me out of there in 30 minutes. The sky was much darker and it was starting to rain. \n \n A quiet electric buzzer beeped, one of the cops slams on the exterior of the booth. `` Alright ya poor slob, get out. Got people waiting!'' \n \n Behind the curtain came a sound of snotty sniveling. `` She is the one! No! Please do n't!'' \n \n The two cops rolled their eyes, pulled open the curtain and dragged the guy out by his coat. After that one of them looked at me. \n \n `` Yer up, loverboy.'' \n \n Just five words. \n \n There it was, an open curtain, flatly painted wooden box of a seat, and a small flat screen in front of it. I sat down, and just like that the curtain was closed and the screen was on. \n \n She looked up, she must have just sat down too. Obviously she had. Of course she had. There she was, there we were, it was happening, and I was looking into her eyes. Her hair was dark brown, almost black, pulled back in a ponytail, a lock of her hair was dangling in front of her face. She smirked at me. We sat there for a moment. We were n't talking, we did n't need to. It worked, all of it worked. Both of us were so happy, we knew it worked. We gamed the system, we found a way around it all. \n \n It must have worked, it must have. She was n't talking because she was waiting for me to say the words. If it did n't work, we'd... we'd be stumbling over ourselves trying to learn everything we could, like every poor fool that comes in here. Why else would we both be sitting here, *not* talking. This is the only 15 minutes we'll ever get. She was waiting for the five words, it must be that. It ca n't be anything else. \n \n I opened my mouth to talk, she lightly bit her lip in anticipation. She made the biggest, most beautiful smile that will ever exist. \n \n I hesitated, I was savoring the moment. I put both my hands on my head and ran them through my hair. *Holy shit*. It worked. Well, we did n't have much time, it was now or never. \n \n I looked deep into her eyes. \n \n `` Have you thought about it?'' I said. \n \n Immediately her eyes filled with tears. She giggled and kept smiling, she put both her hands up to her mouth. \n \n `` Yes,'' she sniffled, `` yes of course I have, you idiot.'' \n \n We both laughed. \n \n `` Of course I thought about it.'' She said, `` we did it.'' \n \n Locked together, forever. Theory into practice. \n \n We laughed, we smiled, we waved goodby. The screen turned off, but we were still together. \n \n **Hit the character limit. The epilogue\/explanation is replied to this. `` ** \n \n \n\n"}

He continued eating. \n `` Fine,'' Belron sighed. `` If you are set upon it, there is nothing I can do. I'll just be left here alone.'' \n `` Now, do n't be so negative,'' Replied Eston `` There will always be the Companion's Bonus from the Guard to keep you going - That, and the countless amount of loot Alron will probably forget about would be invaluable.'' \n `` Just.. make sure you do n't die out there in Dreg-Hel, Eston. I do n't know if I could carry on living without you.'' \n \n \n Eston later found himself at the Gardian keep - As he usually did around work time - in the presence of his guard's leader, Helsi. `` Eston. I have a very unusual task to put upon you, that I assure you I would not entrust to anybody else.'' He said. `` Yes, sir. The Companionship of Alron, I assume.'' Eston replied. \n `` No.'' replied Helsi. \n `` What? What do you mean? Has he rejected me?'' said Eston in a panic. \n `` Unfortunately, no.. You see, our perimeter guard.. found Alron's corpse near southern bluffs.'' \n Eston gasped. Without the Hero, he could not carry through his service, and never find his parents again. \n `` The rest of the guard council has, however, agreed that it would be unwise to let the people panic under the death of their Hero.'' Helsi continued. `` And we have noted a striking resemblance between you and Alron.'' \n Eston waited, in stricken silence. \n `` Eston, we need you to be the next Alron, and slay the Dreg-Hel king.'' \n Eston stood, amazed at this alignment of fate. He waited, and contemplated the implications. \n \n `` I'll do it.'' \n \n \n -Edited: Some phrasing\n"}

Transit vehicles blitzed by in the frozen darkness, their lights blinking in the lifeless night. Shin wandered forward at a meandering pace, his right leg stiffer and heavier than his right leg. Visibly dangerous, his mission would end if metro police spotted him. `` Hey!'' someone called out to him in Chinese, Shin turned slowly toward the sound. Private security, Shin had probably wandered into their territory. `` looking for a hand out?'' Shin barked in shitty Mandarin. As the men closed on him shin revealed the inside of his trench coat. The men disappeared into the frost. Shin marched forward. It would n't be far now. \n \n Shin generally had no problems with Terraforma Corp. from what he read about them they kept to themselves mostly. They definitely did more good then they did bad. `` That's too bad...'' Shin labored forward, his words frost in a starless sky. Shin saw the building up ahead it's edges hard and clear even in the snowstorm. The security gate. `` Stop!'' Shin heard the guard yell in Japanese. The guard paused a moment, he recognized Shin's battle frame. `` Shin, get the fuck out of here'' A a chill wind blew between the two men. `` It's not a good day,'' The guards English was spotty, but Shin forgave him, he was a decent man. `` Today is the only day Seike-san, get the fuck out of here and open that gate.'' Mr. Seike did as he was told and got the fuck out of there, he knew that look on Shin's face. The gate opened to a snow covered yard, maybe 300 yards in diameter. Cold concrete on every side with no visible entryways. That was fine with Shin he was almost there. In the distance Shin could see guards scrambling to get in defensive positions, their breath drifting skyward, if they opened fire now things could get hairy. Shin raised his hands and yelled surrender in 4 different languages. Shin was counting, he knew exactly where he'd have to detonate. Once he was there he released his payload. A series of loud clicks released the payload from his chasis, A large cross like structure dramatically revealed itself in front of Shin. Shin dropped to the ground from the effort. The guards opened fire, molten projectiles lit the courtyard. The cross bounced into the sky sending up a mist of snow then ignited the air around it. A tremendous blast wave ripped through Old Shanghai. \n \n Minutes later Shin stirred in the snow, his battle frame was rocked, but it was designed for this type of scenario. Shin sifted through the rubble looking for something. Cold metal hands gripped a heavy door. A loud clang as Shin ripped the door from it's hinges. A gust of warm pungent air wafted over Shin.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Michael , a 15 year old Call of Duty player , realizes the greatest trash-talking opportunity of all time . Over his headset , he recognizes his opponent 's voice as that of President Obama .\n","story":"There is only one thing trickier than maneuvering through the narrow hallways of Ascend while staying one step ahead of your pursuer, and that's crafting the perfect smack-talk. In this game, outpacing a trail of bullets is only mildly more satisfying than outwitting your opponent on the social landscape. Sure, there were the old fallbacks, the stuff that makes up the background radiation of an FPSer's life, but Michael held himself to a higher standard. \n \n Through years of practice, he'd honed a specific set of rules and methods for trash-talk. You always play nice during the match. You always create an atmosphere of polite, respectful sportsmanship. You always strike up what could be a lasting friendship, finding things in common with the opponent and talking about it at length, all while embroiled in savage combat. And at the end of the match, you always, *always* go in for the kill, using what you've gathered to create the most cutting remark possible before leaving them for the rats. \n \n And nothing had changed about Michael's approach when he recognized the voice over his headset of none other than President Barack Obama. He dealt with the realization in the same cavalier manner with which he threw his next grenade, taking out three of the president's teammates in the process. But where to begin? \n \n Michael began probing immediately, now certain of who his mark would be. He started asking political questions, which, while it riled up most of the combatants, did n't seem to get anywhere with the president. He tried talking about neo-colonialism, the military industrial complex, and even Black Lives Matter, but Obama was oddly silent on all fronts. The match continued, the score wavering between dead even and a one-point advantage for either side. Finally, however, he hit on something that everyone could agree on: Space Exploration. \n \n The president almost immediately chimed in with his thoughts, and suddenly the combat stopped as every other fighter realized exactly who was talking. The match timer ticked away while everyone stood still, in awe of the president's apparent deep-seated passion for astronomy. Michael saw his opportunity with only a few seconds left on the clock. He moved into position. \n \n The president went on: `` Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.'' \n \n Michael's gun went off. Game Over. Red Team Wins. The lobby was silent, everyone in shock. A muffled crackling sound came in over the lobby as Michael adjusted his headset for the final blow. \n \n `` An asteroid, Mr. President.''\n"}

She did as her parents told, followed the rules and excelled in all that she worked at. Her memories of childhood were scattered with memories of Mother taking her hand, tugging her along to her next lesson, be it in music or sports. There was no place for her in high school, where popularity ruled, where being better or able, meant being different. \n \n It became quite clear to her that while Mother and Father hoped to shape her into a young successful woman, they had instead crippled her social status. What did it matter when one could play the most complex and difficult pieces of Beethoven if she were not popular. Her skills set her apart, someone to be jealous of, and hence someone to be hated. \n \n Ana's rebellious stage changed her. Rules started to be broken, lessons skipped, parents scoffed at. It was so easy, yet so hard. The first few days of her attempts at integration into the pecking order was cringe worthy to watch. Lack of social interaction left her without the proper etiquette to approach young teens. \n \n For a good three years, Ana drifted from scene to scene, becoming a party girl that everyone loved. And yet, she felt sad, empty inside. On a rainy summer day, just before senior year, she took a moment to reflect on her past. A grimace forms in her mouth as she replays the ridiculous days of introducing herself to the popular kids, but then nostalgia hits. Saudade rushed over her as she recalled the days spent practicing on the piano, the days training in gymnastics. How little it was worth only a few years ago, and how far she'd fallen. She could no longer play with the nimbleness she once had, nor be as flexible as she'd once been. To give up that much for so little, saddened her. \n \n By the time Fall had come around, no longer was she in her skimpy dresses and makeup, instead back to her plain old self, never once doubting who she is, or who she could be.\n"}

I still can \u2019 t believe people put everything on there.

All because I friended someone who was a friend of someone who was a friend of someone else. \n \n If I took enough from this place, I might be able to stop for a while. I keep thinking each time will be the last, that I don \u2019 t need the money. But, the truth is that I like doing it. I only take items that ask to be taken. Most of them I sell. My connections don \u2019 t ask where I find things anymore. Years ago, I told them a story about a relative who was a hoarder and that seemed to be enough. Occasionally, I keep things. If I like them and they like me or if they have a good story to tell, I let them stay with me. One or two things I \u2019 ve given to my mother. Those objects still thank me. \n \n The kitchen was mostly quiet. The appliances were mumbling, but nothing too loud. They didn \u2019 t seem interested in me at all. I made my way through the first floor to the stairs. The bedrooms were up there and so, most likely, was all the jewelry. The family consisted of an older man, two children, and a young wife. I stopped in the son \u2019 s room first and looked around. \n \n There were electronics everywhere and they started shouting at me. \n \n \u201c Do you want to play? \u201d \n \n \u201c No! No! Watch a movie! \u201d \n \n \u201c Don \u2019 t do that! Listen to music instead! \u201d \n \n I laughed softly and responded back, \u201c I \u2019 m wondering if any of you would like to come with me. I \u2019 m a thief, you know. \u201d They responded with silence. This was usually the case. Some things would be desperate to leave, some hopelessly devoted to their owner. Most were indifferent. I knew I had time and figured I \u2019 d give them a moment. \n \n \u201c I think we \u2019 re happy here, \u201d the stereo finally responded in a calm manner, neither excited nor upset. His response started some murmuring amongst the other electronics. I couldn \u2019 t understand any of what they were saying, there were so many video games talking all at once. \n \n \u201c Shhhhh! \u201d the stereo commanded. I wondered if the deep booming voice that I heard was how the others heard him as well. He sighed. \u201c You need to speak with Mary, \u201d he stated finally. \u201c She \u2019 s in the master bedroom. \u201d Everyone murmured their agreement. \n \n \u201c Thank you, \u201d I replied. \u201c I will find her. \u201d \n \n Even though the house was large, almost a mansion, it was easy to find the master bedroom. I had memorized the layout when I knew I would come here. As soon as I walked into the bedroom, the voices started again. I decided to stop them immediately and asked, \u201c Where is Mary? I was told I should speak with her. \u201d \n \n The murmuring stated again and I started to wonder how much they all gossiped on a regular basis. A diamond bracelet on the nightstand finally started to shout over the rest of them. \u201c She \u2019 s in the jewelry armoire by the photographs. I wouldn \u2019 t bother talking to her, though, she hates almost everyone. \u201d \n \n Now, I was even more eager to meet this Mary. \u201c Thank you for your help, \u201d I replied to the bracelet. Looking at her more carefully, I realized she was probably worth thousands. \u201c By any chance, would you like to come with me? \u201d \n \n \u201c Whatever for? \u201d she responded huffily, \u201c What would you do with me? It \u2019 s not like you \u2019 d wear me or something! No, I am extremely happy with Amanda. I think I \u2019 m her favorite, actually! \u201d \n \n Suddenly, I could hear a commotion from the aforementioned jewelry armoire. It seemed at least a few other pieces disagreed. The diamond earrings next to the bracelet were among them. \n \n \u201c Take us! Take us! \u201d they chimed together. \n \n I smiled at them and asked, \u201c Are you sure? \u201d \n \n \u201c Totally! \u201d they replied together again. \n \n \u201c Thank you, then, \u201d I replied as I slipped them into my bag. I wandered over to the armoire while the bracelet was still complaining about the earrings. I took a deep breath and opened all the doors and drawers quickly. I was excited, the thousands of dollars \u2019 worth of diamonds sitting on the nightstand made me breathless at the possibilities here. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m Mary, \u201d I heard suddenly from the top of the armoire. I walked a little closer and peered at the felt lined fabric. Among the countless modern looking pieces, one caught my eye. Perhaps it was because she was suddenly talking to me again. Perhaps not. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 m Mary, \u201d a beautiful old looking emerald, diamond, and gold ring said quietly but firmly. Her voice even sounded old, especially surrounded by all the young voices of the new jewelry. \n \n \u201c I heard you might want to talk with me, \u201d I started, unsure of how to approach this. \u201c I \u2019 m a thief, but I try to only take things that are willing. \u201d I had decided being honest and brief might be the best here. \n \n \u201c I \u2019 ll happily go with you, young man, \u201d Mary responded, reminding me too much of my grandmother. \u201c However, I \u2019 ll only do so on the condition you return me to my dear Lizzie. \u201d \n \n How was I supposed to respond to that? I tried to speak and started stuttering instead. I looked around and realized I should probably be a little faster about this. I had plenty of time overall, but I \u2019 m not a fan of hanging around asking to be caught. \n \n Before I could reply, Mary spoke again, \u201c On second thought, you may take me regardless of your decision. I would love to see my dear Lizzie again, but to be able to escape that woman is my greatest desire. Add me to your collection now and be quick about it! \u201d \n \n I didn \u2019 t need to be told twice. I carefully scooped her from the delicate black lining and focused on each piece of jewelry nearby. I needed to encourage them to be quick about their decisions. \n \n \u201c Just let me know if you want to come, yes or no, \u201d I said authoritatively. \u201c We can talk about why you want to come later. \u201d I had never had so many pieces trying to talk to me at once. With this much jewelry, I could see how they might not be worn that often. Maybe they were bored. I was happy to help, if that was the case. \n \n Finally, I had found my rhythm. I managed to fill my bag quickly with expensive jewelry and a few small art pieces from the living room that seemed to share Mary \u2019 s desire to escape. It was going to be an interesting evening when I unpacked at home. \n \n Edit: Formatting \n\n"}

Boy did we have a spike in drinking once this shit started going down. But me personally? I think it's crap. It's the media blowing things outta proportion, that's what's happening. You read about some dame dying and suddenly 10 people die. Why? Because you planted that thought in their heads. Worry is what kills people. \n \n *** \n \n I put down the phone and touched my wrist. The delicate strand of silver that caressed my skin, given to me by my mother, felt cold now. Everyone in Atlanta had heard about `` The Clumsy Killer,'' or whatever he was being called these days. I was horrified, living just close enough to the border to give me panic, but I had n't thought my mother was in danger in Texas. There was true tensity in the voices of the hosts of NPR each morning, as they continued to warn their listeners not to overplay what was happening, as that behavior has encouraged copycats in the past. How could a man have gotten into my parent's home to push my mother down the stairs? My father, the enormous intimidating former rugby player would've snapped the neck of anyone he thought would hurt his wife. How could this have happened to me? \n \n *** \n \n My name is David. I am 11 years old. I have two hamsters named Bob and Fred. My best friend is named Joe. I live in Charleston, South Carolina on Lee Street. On Saturday, my mom went to be with Jesus. When she was hanging up our Christmas lights she fell down. The lights caught her and she could n't breathe anymore. Now I live with just my dad and the hamsters. My doctor is named Dr. Pace. Dr. Pace likes when I write in my journal. I like to play kickball with Joe. I miss my mom. \n \n *** \n \n The worry, it's killing everyone, I tell you that. 27 in two weeks, ha, seems like a blip. Last week there were 48 and counting, all over the southeast US. One of my buddies reads those `` international real truth'' news sites, and he says other countries got the same thing going down. Says in Africa, people are just getting eaten by animals day and night, like they're going out unarmed from the smaller villages, acting mighty freaky. England had to totally shut down their subway on account of so many people falling in and getting crushed or electrocuted or whatever. But I got ta tell you, me and my buddies, we're just fine. Taking in a cold brew each night, watching the game, just staying calm is saving our lives. \n \n *** \n \n The funeral was completely tasteful, but I did n't understand why a single policeperson had yet to speak to us. It was like the Austin authorities believed my mom had truly just tripped and fallen. Three more cases in Austin just over the weekend - all children choking to death on leftover Halloween candy they had hidden. They were triplets. God, the family must be crushed. NPR was at a loss for what to say, but they talked more than ever. But no opinions, no suggestions, simply reports cropping up all over the US and internationally. This could n't be a string of copycats. It just could n't. It had to be some kind of organized terrorism force or something. I stroked my silver bracelet and wished I could speak to my mother, have her reassure me as she always had. I needed her strength, her guidance. I had only my father and brother now, both silent, these sturdy creatures completely fractured and unable to cope. \n \n *** \n \n One of my hamsters ate my other hamster. Now I have only one hamster. I was really sad so my dad bought me a cool snake. My snake's name is Rex. Rex is cool and his skin is really cold. Dad said I ca n't take Rex out to play when also I'm playing with Bob, cus then Rex would eat Bob. Rex is a python snake. I do n't know if there's kinds of hamsters, but if there is, Bob is the coolest kind. Even though he likes eating other hamsters. \n \n *** \n \n I'm stressing out. I said it, there, I'm stressed. Not because I think it's some kind of end of days crap, but because of what happened today on my route. Charlie was driving and I was loading, and I should've noticed something was up but I just wanted to get through the day. I just picked up the can, it was heavy but so are most these days, filled up with pizza boxes and beer bottles on account of no one recycles anymore, and just tossed it in. I did n't hear anything at all, but I saw it, I saw it probably a second too late. Just this little foot, tiny little toes, the hem of some kind of pajamas around his ankle. I turned everything off, I hollered for Charlie, I hollered for God but I knew it was over. The parents tore out of the house like it was on fire, screaming for `` Justin'', who I guess it took them a while to realize was gone. Cops say he had just climbed in the bottom of the can and threw a bag on top of him. His folks had been really lighting each other up about whether or not to get out of the country and Justin had just snuck out. He was eight years old, and I crushed him to death with a trash compactor. I did that. It was just an accident.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Tell me a story about goddamn DRAGONS .\n","story":"October 27th, 1943. Dover, England. \n \n Captain Benjamin Carter strode out into the dark morning air, his fur lined leather jacket pulled tight against the autumn chill. His flying helmet was fitted over his head, the goggles raised above the narrow brim. Thick pants covering his legs were tucked stout boots, a parachute strapped firmly to his back. His flying harness trailed behind him, the series of double canvas straps and metal carabiners a muffled jingle in his covered ears. A Colt M1911 has holstered in its case at his belt where also hung a series of maps, navigation tools and other needed equipment. Behind him, similarly dressed men followed, bundled tight in the flying leathers. \n \n The beasts were just waking up to the smell of fresh blood, of prime cattle being butchered in the slaughter pens just a few hundred yards over. Even in the cold morning air Carter could taste the iron tang of the dying animals on his tongue so thick it was. The dragons certainly could as well. \n \n Handlers raced from between the pens and the slaughter fields while others worked tirelessly at the ammunition depots preparing for the upcoming mission. Some carried leviathan sections of flak armor that required the assistants of Jeeps to shift from one section of the airfield to another. \n \n The various beasts called out to their captains as they caught sight of them, a chorus of shouted cries. It was well known by now dragons' keen intellect, on par for most humans actually. Capable of learning tongues in the shell, they could easily speak with their crews and the groundspeople. One of them perked its massive head, smiling with its bayonet long fangs. \n \n `` Good morning, Carter! Are you ready? Are we going to fight today?'' \n \n Dragons. Bloodthirsty creatures. \n \n The army captain nodded under his thick clothing. \n \n `` Yep, Kearsage. We're green lit for today. Escort run, we take the heavies in, they drop their bombs, and we all high tail it out before the Krauts can even touch us.'' \n \n The middle weight beast nodded its head. \n \n `` Good, good. Do you think I can have a little extra cow today? It's particularly fresh smelling this morning.'' \n \n Kearsage was a Razorback, one of the newer breeds raised in the interwar period. Substituting speed for thicker armored scales, the Razorbacks could take a hell lot more abuse from enemy jaws and talons than other similar sized dragons. His hide was a mottled brown and grey while lethal looking fangs studding its jaws. Two of them lent the breed its moniker, wicked looking things reminiscent to a boar's tusks. Once a Razorback had its jaw on its foe, few escaped to tell the tale. \n \n It was to be a big armada, with over two hundred heavies of various types. The massive Longhorns and Grave Dealers mostly, their bellies covered with stowed bombs. A few Morgans were mixed in for good measure, the steady natures of the beasts lending them to be excellent gun platforms as well as a truly titanic Ax-Head, custom bred to act as a carrier for smaller beasts. \n \n The medium weight dragons, the workhorses were in good numbers, some forty in all. Razorbacks and Kentucky Flyers for the most part, one or two rarer Harlan's as well. They're job was to keep the enemy's dragons occupied until their own bombed the assigned target. \n \n The smallest of the combat weights, the Pinto's and Redtails chattered eagerly amongst themselves. Breed purely for dedication and loyalty, the latter breed was a popular one amongst the heavy dragon crews, who counted on the lighter beast not to stray far from the armada. \n \n Carter checked his watch. 4:28. In thirty minutes time, three hundred dragons would take flight and journey across the English channel, over the Netherlands to bomb manufactoring plants in Ruhr region. An estimated two hundred enemy dragons were expected to be stationed within flight distance of the attack's path, dragons who had seen and fought in some the most vicious battles of the war. El Alamein, The Blitz, Stalingrad, Leningrad. They and their crews were well breed, well trained and battle hardened. They would fight savagely. But he was confident in their own skill, and in the righteousness of their cause. He'd fight the Germans in the sky, one dragon at a time.\n"}

Agnes timidly interjected. \n \n `` Well, yes, technically. But I ca n't go all the way up a mountain dragging Esmerelda around in the cold mountain air, `` replied Magrat, `` besides, in front of the castle's big fireplace is so much more cozy.'' \n \n `` Humph!'' humphed a voice from the dark corner beside the fireplace ( which was a modern contrivance that Verence had had installed. When fully operational it heated enough water to keep the kitchen supplied and the south visitors wing. ) \n `` Well it's true Granny.'' \n \n `` It's not supposed to be cozy, being a witch.'' came the sharp voice of Granny Weatherwax. \n \n `` Yes Granny,'' agreed Magrat meekly, `` but then again, it's a hard enough job, we should make it simpler and easier where we can.'' \n \n Nanny smiled to herself, Magrat was getting quite good at handling Granny by agreeing with her. \n \n `` Why are we meeting, anyways?'' asked Agnes. Granny rolled her eyes, causing Agnes to bristle. \n \n `` To figure out what happens now that He is gone, of course,'' Magrat quickly interjected. \n \n `` What's there to figure out? Whatever happens, happens.'' replied Nanny. \n \n `` Yes Nanny,'' agreed Magrat, `` but what if we need to decide our part to play in what happens?'' \n \n `` Do n't you be maliciously agreeing with me Magrat Garlick...'' started Nanny. \n \n `` Excuse me for interrupting dear...'' interrupted Verence. \n \n `` Wotcher, highness'' \n \n `` Nanny. `` King Verence gave a respectful nod to each witch. `` I was going up for the night and thought I would take Esmerelda with me.'' \n \n `` Thank you, that would be lovely.''

Will I never see little Esme grow up?'' \n \n `` Humph'', humphed the dark corner. Nanny looked over, then looked back at Magrat, \n \n `` I do n't think so Pet. We continue on...'' \n \n `` Humph...'' \n \n `` Well honestly Esme, say what you want to say. Do n't sit there humphing like a hephalump.'' \n \n `` Stories,'' she spat, `` It's all down to stories, and what they need.'' \n \n `` What story?'' enquired Agnes, `` Are we'changing the momentum of a story' again?'' \n \n `` Are we in a story?'' asked Magrat. \n \n `` Magrat Garlick, you are a wet hen. Of course we're in a story, we've always in stories. When you saved that onion farmer, Scrunchion's, baby from a fever, the story went up and down the mountain faster than a broomstick. And that's just it. Stories need two things, a teller and an audience.'' Granny Weatherwax sat back in the comfortable rocking chair that Magrat had placed in the corner for her use, as close to relaxed as she ever was. \n \n `` And...?'' asked Magrat. \n \n `` And, the audience becomes the teller. And the stories continue, perhaps not as vibrantly, but they continue. Stories retold, and stories new. And so we continue. Esme will grow up, we grow older, things change and things stay the same.'' She paused, `` And he knew it, and he would n't have wanted it any other way.'' \n \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] I was n't trying to overthrow the kingdom . I was just trying to get back home .\n","story":"`` Open this gate.'' The mage's cold voice rang out, clear across the square. \n \n `` I'm sorry sir, but by order of the king...'' The guard trailed off as the mage's eyes started glowing. Everyone had magic, and everyone could use it, but it was their life-force. No one drew on it without thinking, for there was no way to recover it. \n \n `` Open. The. Gate. I am a foreigner in this city, and I wish to leave.'' \n \n `` I ca n't.'' The guard's reply was cracked, and almost whispered. As the glow in the mage's eyes brightened, he stumbled back, screaming. `` NO! I swear it. I physically ca n't open the gate! No one can! The king wills it to remain shut, and it does!'' \n \n The voice that followed was layered with deep and powerful magic. `` It remains shut no more.'' \n \n The gate groaned, the large slabs of metal and stone seemed to flex. Then, all of a sudden, they burst outwards. The mage could have used a simpler spell, one that simply opened the gate, but he completely destroyed it. The slabs broke into chunks, the chunks into shards, them into smaller shards, and the smallest of shards broke into dust, which floated away on the wind. The gate was no more. The mage dropped to his knee, a large portion of his life used up to destroy the gate, and everyone just stood there, unable to hide their awe. \n \n Slowly, the mage stood back up to his full height. His face had paled, and his voice wavered a little as he spoke again. \n \n `` If any among you are tired of living under the thumb of a ruler who shuts off his own city, you may come with me, and never again live in the shadow of his terror.'' \n \n His words were simple, so they moved many. His voice was shaking, no matter how powerful a magic he had just wielded, he was still a human, just like them. He had been willing to sacrifice that much of his own power, to remove a symbol of oppression from the world entirely, now only notable for its absence. This had promoted him to the rank of a hero of the people. He walked, haltingly, through the hole in the wall, and was followed, not immediately, but later, by those who hated their lives within the walls. People from all walks of life had followed him, including those sworn to the service of His Royal Majesty. \n \n They caught him by nightfall, and they camped together overnight. He told tales of his homeland, and what they were leaving the cruelty for. He told them of freedom, which they had gained by leaving. He warned them that their lives would not be easy, but they would at least be their own. None turned back. They all pledged to carry on, with him, and to make sure that he did n't have to waste any more of his life-force on the journey. Eventually, only a few people were left awake, they claimed that they would keep watch, but eventually, sleep claimed them too. \n \n Dawn came, and with it, a lone figure striding towards the camp. He was dressed in a cloak of purple, a black shirt and trousers, lined with silver, an ornate belt, from which hung an elegant sword. His long, golden hair was almost allowed to fall as it naturally would. It was constrained, ever so slightly, at the top of his head, by a crown of gold, diamonds, rubies, and sapphires set along it. He came with the grace of a monarch, and the rage of a dragon. He had expended a lot of energy, long ago, to keeping that gate shut. \n \n The mage went to meet him, wearing the same brightly coloured clothes that any peasant might, no weapon upon him, no crown upon his head, and his messy dark hair bound, as best it could be, behind his head. His skin was no longer paled from his efforts, his gait was normal. The two met a hundred paces from the camp, where none could hear them. \n \n `` So, the new king comes to meet me himself...'' The king commented drily. His voice was clearly on accustomed to commanding his lessers. \n \n `` No new king, I'm afraid. I have n't the ambition to become such. I was n't trying to dethrone you. I was n't trying to overthrow the kingdom. I was just trying to get back home.'' \n \n `` It matters not, what you *were* trying to do, but rather what you *managed* to do. Do you see? You must have snuck into my city in the dead of night, over the walls, thinking that you would be able to simply leave during the day if you wished. You were around long enough that you disagreed with my style of reign, and you decided that you would leave with a commotion, so that all could see the one who cast their chains off. You may not have *meant* to try to overthrow my kingdom, but you most certainly did try to overthrow me.'' \n \n The mage was silent. The king's speech had made sense. Normally, he would n't have reacted in such a manner, but this time, he could n't bear to see the king's atrocities continue. \n \n `` I see that you are beginning to understand your position, so I shall give you this advice, from one king to another. These people are now loyal to you. You would figure this out sooner or later, but there is a rule, never told to the commoners, about magic. If a person truly gives you their loyalty, a small fraction of their life-force will flow from them to you, and will keep you alive as long as people believe in you. It is why I have ruled so long, and become so cynical, and why most of the captains of my guard have n't even considered leaving. They've been around almost as long as I have.'' \n \n `` Why tell me this?'' \n \n `` Because, it would not do to have you attack me. I am hoping that your gratitude, your sense of honour, and what logic you possess will tell you that I should not be attacked. Leave me and mine alone, and I shall extend the same courtesy to you. Do we have a deal?'' The kings tone was dangerous as he asked the last question. \n \n The mage thought about it. He sighed. \n \n `` I need make no such deal. You are afraid of me, and the people I have rescued from you. No, you do n't want me to attack you, but you wo n't risk losing everyone's loyalty by ordering your men to attack their family and friends. But do n't worry, your mind may have turned to war, but I think only of peace. I will not attack you, not as things stand, but nor will I be your ally, implicitly or no. Please, leave us now. We have many leagues to cover before we come t these people's new home.'' \n \n The king snorted softly, and shook his head. `` Foolish boy. You do n't realise how dangerous of an enemy I can be. However, I must consolidate my kingdom before I can turn my mind, and armies, towards such a goal. Goodbye, your majesty.'' The last two words were twisted and ugly. \n \n The two turned from each other, the king walking through empty fields towards the city, and the mage towards his new people, and his home.\n"}

Thus, on this very day, May the Twenty-Sixth, in the Year of Our Lord 1655, I have my final confession to bear: \n \n Though proof was scarce, I knew it in my very heart and soul that William Shakespeare did away with my dearest friend Christopher Marlowe. We were not lovers, as I do not believe his eyes were ever on the Fairer Sex, but dearest of friends nonetheless. He was a brother, a confident, and I felt our bond deep within my very soul. The day he was slain was the day my life took a turn down a dark path from which it never truly emerged. I found true love in my marriage to the Frenchman I met in Dorset, I bore nine healthy children all of whom have survived to bear me twenty-three grandchildren, and I am a wealthy woman. Yet the sword that pierced Marlowe in turn pierced my heart, and the hole has never closed. It has been a dark cloud over a blessed life. \n \n After murdering the light of my life, Shakespeare stole his life's work and added it to his own. I had the burden of having to spend time with the monster, and feign ignorance as to his true nature. I heard him chatter like a young maiden about Macbeth. From the moment he wrote it, he adored it. Whether or not it was even from his own Plume was a question that has always lingered. How many bodies did Shakespeare leave behind him? I should n't say such a thing without evidence, but my rage flowed through me. \n \n There should always be a trail of Death with Shakespeare's work. Then, all can know his nature as I have. I obtained a pair of chicken feet, a bloodied knife ( both from a local Butcher ), and a small piece of wood. I sha n't repeat the curse I used, but't was an ancient Latin Rhyme. The night o the premier, August 7, 1606,'t was I standing behind the Theatre, dressed in Black, conducting a Play of my very own. \n \n The first fatality was that night. I felt some sorrow at having taken the young gentleman playing Lady Macbeth, but I knew the Spectre of Death would now haunt Shakespeare. \n \n The curse should lose potency with time.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] At birth , everyone is randomly assigned one law they can break for the rest of their life . You are given ... .. loitering .\n","story":"The Anti-Law Lottery never excited me much. The prospect of a personal, individual freedom was theoretically tantalizing until I learned the definition of `` loitering''. Knowing I could stand around without legal repercussions was fine, but it was n't high up my list of priorities. I usually had another way to spend my time, anyway, rather than waiting around for someone to decide I had crossed the threshold between Plain Old Regular Standing Around and my Anti-Law allotment. \n \n That was the way it was for most of my childhood. The possibility was always in the back of my mind, but it was n't until my first year of middle school that I decided to really give it a proper go. \n \n It was June. My gym class was deep in the midst of a fourth lap around the track, and my adolescent weight clung to me tenaciously. The sun was attempting to melt my rubber shoes to the black tar of the asphalt. Sweat leaked from every pore on my body, and I tried to lose myself in thoughts of air-conditioning, struggling to keep placing one foot in front of the other. \n \n I glanced at Coach Morgan, who straddled the track, a cranky, overweight Colossus; his disapproval furrowed across his brow, and he fired off an unnecessary blast on the whistle hanging from his neck as students whizzed by. `` Let's keep it up!'' he shouted at us all, clapping twice. \n \n As I rounded the corner near his position, I saw - as one might see a vision of a lush garden in the desert - the apparition of a few trees near the building walls and their accompanying shade. My path became clear. I stumbled into the restorative cover and stood, heaving, as my breath returned slowly. \n \n Mr. Morgan turned toward me, non-plussed. `` Did you get lost? Back on the track!'' \n \n My heart quickened, knowing what I was about to do. I wiped the sweat from my forehead and dragged the damp palm across my shirt. `` I, um. I do n't want to?'' \n \n His brows rose a few inches from their perch. `` It's not a request!'' \n \n `` I know, but... It's my Anti-Law.'' \n \n He stood still for a moment, his jaw hanging open in half-amusement, half-disgust. `` Your Anti-Law is being lazy?'' Students slowed to listen as they approached at the bend. \n \n `` No, I mean - loitering. Loitering is my Anti-Law.'' \n \n `` Son, I do n't give a sh-... I do n't give a darn whether your Anti-Law is cake for breakfast. You are at school, and we are responsible for you. When you're in my class, you answer to me.'' \n \n `` But... but this is what I can do! I'm allowed to do this!'' Six or seven people in my class had slowed to a shuffle, and one was at a dead stop, watching and waiting for an outcome. Defiance swelled up in me like a fiery boil, hot and ready to burst. I knew I was being stupid, but something about this did n't seem right. If I could n't exercise my Anti-Law at will, what was the point? If not now, when would I ever? \n \n `` You can do plenty, but that do n't mean I wo n't bust your ass for it.'' All pretense of cleaning up his language was gone now, the menace dripping from his voice. He advanced swiftly across the trim-but-browning grass as I stood, helpless, and he grabbed my arm so tightly it hurt. The moment he took hold of me, all my anger deflated, and my twelve-year-old self knew that nothing in life would ever be simple or fair. \n \n He led me - dragged me, really - into the principal's office, and dumped me into the waiting chair. \n \n `` What happened?'' asked Prinicipal Goulding, looking up from the stack of folders and papers on his desk. \n \n `` Kid wo n't run,'' Morgan spat. \n \n Goulding glanced at me. `` Why not?'' \n \n `` Says it's his Anti-Law.'' \n \n `` Not running is his...?'' \n \n `` Loitering.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' Goulding sighed. `` I'll take it from here.'' \n \n `` All right, but do n't let him...'' \n \n `` I've got it, Charles.'' \n \n `` Good, fine.'' Charles - I had not known that was his first name - positively stomped out of the office and slammed the door behind him, leaving the principal and I alone. \n \n Goulding paused a moment, probably to collect his thoughts, and then looked me in the eye. `` All right. So your Anti-Law is loitering.'' \n \n I nodded, sullen, picking at my palm. My sweat was making me stick to the vinyl backing on the chair. \n \n He looked me over. `` Pretty hot out there, I gather.'' \n \n I nodded again. \n \n He turned away. `` You know... My brother-in-law's Anti-Law sounds great, on the surface. Want to know what he got? Public intoxication.'' \n \n In spite of myself, I giggled. \n \n He turned his head and looked at what I assumed was a family portrait on his desk. `` I know, it sounds funny, right? You better believe he loved to tailgate, that's for sure. Cops could n't touch him. But he's an angry drunk. The shouting matches he started did n't go so well.

My mother would literally set me on fire when she found out. \n \n He laughed. `` I'm not giving you detention.

{"prompt":"[ EU ] Bruce Banner has n't slept in days , he comes home one day to find a stranger in his house . The stranger introduces himself as Tyler Durden .\n","story":"I got off the bus and jogged the last half mile to the house. Maybe a little bit more of physical exhaustion would help. Joe Fixit grumbling all day had already provided all the mental exhaustion I needed. \n \n All I wanted was a nice hot shower to get the smell of chicken processing plant off me. It was boring work. It was tedious work. Boring was good. Tedious was good. It was hard to get mad at boring or tedious. \n \n I had a nice little sweat going when I could see the house. I'm not in the best shape. Really, I'm quite frumpy. I've always neglected an exercise routine. It never seemed a priority during the day. Always something else to worry about. Like getting the smell of chickens off me. I slowed down, and let the wind cool me down. Maybe I would be able to sleep tonight. It had been almost a week. \n \n The problem with tedium is that the mind just keeps spinning. The math keeps rolling in your head. I could n't write everything down at the plant. I had to wait until I got back to the house. I'd filled out countless notebooks. The whiteboard was full again, and I had even started writing on the walls. A bad habit I know. Once a week, I scanned them and used a deaddrop email and sent them to Reed. He'd parse through them and use what he could and forward the rest. \n \n The door was unlocked. I was getting forgetful. There was n't anything valuable in the house anyways. Anyone who could understand the math could have it. Anyone who could n't, would n't bother. \n \n I walked in, and lounged on the couch was a man. He looked like Stark. \n \n Fuck Stark. Arrogant prick. No no. Tony is a friend. That's Fixit talking. \n \n The man sitting there did n't look like Tony Stark, he felt like Tony. He was Blond though. Confident. Drinking? I could smell the alcohol from the door. Tony had n't drank in years. \n \n `` Ah, you're back. How was the plant?'' He smiled, like a devil. `` About ready to quit that chicken coupe yet?'' He stood, tossed me the bottle. Scotch, cinnamon infused. It smelled good. \n \n This felt familiar. It felt right. \n \n `` Not yet'' I replied. i walked over to the kitchen and grabbed a glass and ice. \n \n `` I'm liking the formula you have here on the south wall, Bobby my Boy'' Bobby.... That's right. I was using Robert while I was here. `` So, what's the deal. Why you wringing chicken necks. You diddle the wrong dean's daughter when you were a prof?'' \n \n Who was he... What lies had I told... So many towns... He knew me. He seemed so familiar. Play it safe. Best to let him build his own assumptions. `` Something life that.'' Fake smile. Look uncomfortable. \n \n `` This is good scotch.'' It was really good scotch. A couple more of these and I'd be out. I downed the first one, poured a second, and topped his off. I sat on the other end. \n \n `` I told you. Your old buddy Tyler Durden has got the best hook ups in the county. Sooner or later you'll believe me.'' Tyler Durden. Familiar. Ca n't place it, but the scotch is helping warm me up after the walk. \n \n `` That's right, dry county.'' I said, just to keep talking. I could feel the boredom going away. This was the first person I could talk to who seemed to be running at the same speed. Everyone else was in a different gear. Not a bad thing, but it's just hard to communicate with folks who do n't have the same intelligence. There's maybe two dozen people on the planet I can have a normal conversation with. Most of them in New York. Stark is Stark. Reed is often out of my league. Pym has his own issues. Parker is young. But Tyler... I do n't have to hold anything back.. I do n't have to deal with the entire purple pants thing. I can bitch about the chicken plant. We can drink scotch. We can talk math a little. He might not get it but he listens. \n \n `` Hey man.. Wan na go to the old quarry an throw some old dynamite in?'' \n \n Joe Fixit perks up. Hulk perks up. I perk up. I'm not sure if it's the scotch or not, but man does that seem like a good idea. \n \n `` Hell yes I do. Do we have more scotch?'' \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"}

Zeus gripped his personal sword in his hand tightly, almost caving it in. `` Just like they killed my son, they will kill the rest of us.'' \n \n `` It's different from last time though.

The ship slowly plunged towards Earth, gradually picking up speed as it fell. At the rate it was falling, and considering the size of the ship ( twelve football fields in length ) it would decimate any region of land it landed in, and if it landed in the ocean... entire coastlines would be underwater within hours when the tsunamis hit. \n \n `` How can we put an end to her?

You understand how far my abilities go, right? If you let me command your troops, we will have greater success.'' \n \n Zeus glowered at the devil in front of him. `` You... you dare mention the ability you stole from my son, right in front of me?!

But know this, I will hand rule over to you temporarily, and only if you agree to sign a magical binding contract to release them back to me once the Volgrim are defeated. Of course, if we all die, then the contract would also be pointless.'' \n \n Satan nodded. `` A sensible plan. Zeus... I want you to know this though. I did kill your son, but I bore no hatred for Hercules. It was during wartime, not a personal act of vengeance. I know you will never forgive me, but if I could, I would bring him back.

At the orders of General Connor, he and his squad were to break inside the ship and blast these alien scum to kingdom come, and retrieve'Overmind', the secret AI prototype that the aliens had stolen. \n \n `` Code 13, we've got company!'' A voice squawked in his ear as massive automatons came stomping out from behind a corner, aiming their twin barelled guns at him. Connor's own battle armor, the Micro-Dreadnaught Mk. II, was a specially outfitted mecha, equipped with jet thrusters on all sides for rapid movement. But more importantly, it was sync'd directly into his brain. \n \n Their shots never had a prayer of hitting. \n \n As they fired, he leaped up into the air, the thrusters rotating him vertically and blasting him upwards at the same time, as his boots magnetically attached to the metal ceiling, allowing him to rush forwards, spraying Gauss Cannon fire at the enemy mechas. \n \n Boom, blam! One down, three to go! He shot at them with incredible precision, his Gauss Cannon aiming and firing far faster than if it were controlled with a trigger pressed by his finger. \n \n Leaping from the ceiling at one of the enemy mechas, he whipped out a sword hilt, a massive blade suddenly extending out of it, as a chainsaw like motion occurred on the edges. _Vibro-sword_, an advanced weapon capable of cutting through nearly anything. As he leaped at his opponent, one of the mechas swiveled their gun at him. With his right arm and the sword aimed at the first combatant, the left arm whipped out, firing the Gauss Cannon directly at the enemy mech's head, blasting it off in a single shot, as he plunged the sword into the first one's chest. \n \n `` One left!'' He barked into his headset. Just as he was about to swing the sword at the final mecha, mere feet away, a blast of mental feedback surged into his brain, causing him to scream in pain as he stumbled and fell to the ground. \n \n `` C-15! Watch out! He's on your-!'' Ten rapid shots blasted into his side panels as the final enemy shredded him with white hot plasma shots. They did n't manage to penetrate his armor as it was heavily reinforced, but his systems rapidly began shutting down as the enemy mecha prepared one final salvo to eradicate his soul from this realm. \n \n At that instant, the mecha exploded, as a single human, without a combat mecha, but wearing a white helmet and a white cape with the Golden Eagle emblazoned on the front of his suit, jumped from behind the other mecha at inhuman speeds. \n \n `` Th-the supreme admiral is here?!'' C-15 yelled in astonishment at the sight of the most powerful human in existence. \n \n The man's helmet slid open as he stared evenly at the fallen mech. `` C-15, I'll repair you, but make sure to watch yourself next time. Take your psionic shielding pill like you're supposed to or next time I wo n't be here to clean you off the floor.'' \n \n Supreme Admiral, Jason Hiro, slid his helmet shut, as he aimed his hand at the Micro-Dreadnaught Mk. II, and magically, it began repairing itself. He slid his helmet back open again, a strange ritual he seemed to do every time he used his powerful magic. `` I'm going to the core, _alone_. You guys head to the hangar bay, sabotage as many of their ships and systems as you can. I'll see you guys in hell, if I manage to destroy this ship like I intend.'' \n \n `` Yes, Supreme Admiral! We are at your disposal!'' C-15 grinned as his mecha righted itself once again. Reaching up and popping a pill, he quickly started charging forwards, as his company flanked his sides. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n ( Part 2 in next comment.

About one of these every hour or so. I'll help and keep reminding you, but it's very important.'' \n He laughed and opened the bottle up, `` Okay Auntie. Whatever you say!'' He took a sip and started laughing again, `` oh I think I can feel my magic in my belly! When can I start casting spells?'' \n I smiled and kissed his head, `` oh in another hour or so you should be casting all sorts of spells. Let's go find you a wand!'' \n With that we went into the back yard, laughing together. Maybe this wo n't be so hard, I thought, until I heard a scream. I turned around and saw my nephew standing, staring, transfixed at the air in front of him. I ran over to him and asked him what was the matter. He pointed up to a spider web I hadnt seen before and told me he was scared and he needed me to make it go away. So I picked him up, kissed him gently on the head and continued my tale of magic, `` No honey, I ca n't make him go away. The spider is our friend! He's here to help us. Spiders are very wise and if you're nice to him, he will help you. You can learn to read webs and talk to them if you listen very very closely. But that is a lesson I shall teach you another day.

It's like being thirsty while standing in a pool of water and you ca n't reach it. Only the other way around. I do n't want to drink but something is force feeding me the best water available. Not for the sake of being a nice person. Just because I do n't want to drink some evil is forcing it upon me. I spend more time thinking about the reason for this more than I invested in new suicide plans. For example I consider not sleeping being part of the big picture. I was an engineer once, so I build a few gadgets that keep me from sleeping. Some of these use pretty painful methods. I am sure one kills me every now and then. But how do I know? I might just sleep and wake up. I could never remember my dreams and the time from one death to waking up again is dreamless as well. So is sleeping the same thing as a short death? \n \n Sleep deprivation gives me the strangest hallucinations. Some times I thought I had succeeded in taking this unwanted life. Than came the afterlife. Horrible. I want all this to stop and not another life for another eternity. My actual eternity started after I was hit by one of those silent, eco-friendly cars. When I woke up in the hospital I realized that I always liked to opt-out of my life. A trigger event. Everyone told me that I was lucky and I told them to shut up. Hatred seems to be a shared emotion, the more you hate them, the more they hate you. I hated them first, so that was not my problem. My problem is that sleepless eternity that I ca n't get out. \n \n I am playing without the old rule book. I need no sleep, no food or the pills they gave me after the accident. I have been doing this for roughly three months now. I ca n't feel any effect from the lack of food or the countless gallons of blood I lost since then. Not refilling is another tactic to wear my body out. But this invulnerable corpse of my is not able to die. \n \n Maybe this little talent of mine is just a measure of some greater good to keep me out of paradise? Who needs an extra place like hell, when you can make life on earth someone's personal purgatory?\n"}

After dragging the commanders of each army ( well, the highest ranking, still living soldiers to be more precise ) before the UN, an armistice was drawn up and signed under duress. At first, both factions were fairly uncooperative. But the USA has a way with words. Especially when those words are an affirmation that nukes can pass through inter-dimensional portals, but further testing is required to understand the effects of a trans-dimensional detonation.

I would notice when a few days had gone by without any music. \n \n Months went by and I still never saw them. Every other neighbor I had run into on the way in or out, and exchanged greetings, but not this neighbor. The only sign of existence from this neighbor was the music. \n \n They were playing hard rock one night as I sat out on the balcony smoking a cigarette. I watched a dog wander in the road aimlessly. Up the street, down the street, after a squirrel, distracted by something else; the dog would roam around, occasionally greeting other dogs and their owners. I had never seen this dog before, I stayed outside long after I was finished smoking just to keep an eye on him. It was never wise to approach stray dogs. \n \n Cars drove by, missing the dog by a few ft. A young couple tried to coax it into their car to no avail.

I lit another cigarette and continued to watch in amusement at the dog \u2019 s antics. \n \n In a split second, a Toyota Camry came barreling down the road, crushing the dog in its path before continuing its rampage.

Their commonalities were naked, revealed upon the velvet faces of the Tapestry. \n \n \n Sesonga surveyed them from atop his throne of parchment. He could identify each individual; he could recite the thoughts within their minds, for he had spent decades memorizing what would occur this day. \n \n \n He knew, for instance, that he would now hear the words: *They must give birth soon. We can not wait, or they could risk the Tapestry. * \n \n \n \u201c They must give birth as soon as possible. They might risk the Tapestry, \u201d said Zealot Ausar at his right. \n \n \n A spark, almost imperceptible, appeared upon the Tapestry. It left a thin tendril of smoke, languid and malnourished, in its wake. Sesonga spat upon the Zealot, who seemed too stunned at his own heresy to react. \n \n \n \u201c Arrogance such as that will doom us all, Ausar! \u201d \n \n \n The Zealot fell to his knees, eyes filled with tears. \n \n \n He spoke, choked: \u201c They must give birth soon. We can not wait, or they could risk the Tapestry. \u201d \n \n \n And then he whimpered, watching the line of smoke beseechingly. \n \n \n It curled into a spiral, became an ourobouros and consumed itself into nothing. It left a dark burn where its root once was. \n \n \n Zealot Ausar breathed out loudly and drew a gash upon his scarred palms with a dagger. Repentance. \n \n \n Sesonga surveyed the gathering again. They had witnessed the exchange and the damage done to the Tapestry. Their expressions were different, their gestures hinted at thoughts that he did not know of. \n \n \n They had changed. \n \n \n Diverged from the Sacred Timeline. \n \n \n Order had to be imposed immediately. \n \n \n He shouted: \u201c People of the Eighty-Seventh Generation!

Recite! ** \n \n \n And Sesonga could see them return to their destinies.

Verbatim. Just as the Prophet had asked. \n \n \n The gathering cheered once more. An impudent giggle marred its Adherence.

They recalled the sacrifices of their ancestors, the heroes who wrested control of the world and forced it to Adhere to the Tapestry. The men and women who had funneled the infinite possibilities of time into the one singular path that was written of so many centuries ago. \n \n \n The Ritual of the Aeons. \n \n \n The Maintenance of the Sacred Timeline. \n \n \n They chanted of Uteyelvasi the Vermillion Consort, who brought down the Songbird Revolts that threatened to create an alternate timeline. The most crucial of conquests. \n \n \n They chanted of Yasavarman the Determinist, who saw the indiscipline of the Middle Centuries and discovered the Third Interpretation that had stabilized the timeline. The greatest of enlightenments. \n \n \n They spoke of Ithyeru the Savant, whose unknowable methods mended the Tapestry after ages of decay, which dragged the world back to the path it should \u2019 ve followed in a blink of an eye.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You wake up in a morgue with no memory . On a table next to you is a brown envelope marked 'Confidential ' .\n","story":"The sensation of cold metal ran up my spine and my eyes snapped open. I sat up quickly and sucked in deep gasp of air. My chest rose and fell quickly and then I felt a slight twinge of pain. Looking down I saw black pattern making its way up and down my torso. I reached to feel it and drew my hand back quickly. The area was slightly red and tender, but without a doubt I knew what they were. That familiar feeling of thread. At some point and time I'd gotten stitches. \n \n `` What the fuck,'' I mumbled. \n \n I looked up and glanced about the room. It was cold and had an odd smell. Somewhere between a hospital room and chemicals I could n't quite place. I looked back down to see that I was sitting up high on a metal table. A white sheet covered my waist down. I was naked and in an unfamiliar place. I'd be lying if I said this was the first time this had happened, but I usually woke up in bedrooms or living rooms. Usually the wake up was abrupt and followed by a hungover walk to a diner for breakfast. \n \n As my head began to clear and I began gathering my thoughts, it occurred to me I had n't gone out the night before. I turned around slowly and it clicked as to where I was. Behind me were rows and columns of what resembled large filing cabinets. On the cabinets were names and the stamp'T.O.D' below them. I was in a morgue. I turned back to sit forward, careful not to tear my stitches... stitches? A new wave of panic washed over me. Why did I have stitches? Why did I have them in a morgue of all places? I began scanning the rest of my body but found no other marks. \n \n `` Hello,'' I tried to shout but my throat was to dry, `` is there anyone in here?'' \n \n Silence. I called out again but was only met with the brief echo of my own voice. I sunk my face into my hands. \n \n `` What the hell is happening?'' \n \n I looked back up and of to my right to see a brown envelope on the other table next to me. I brought my legs off to the side slowly and grabbed the sheet. I started to try and stand up but instead stumbled forward like a newborn calf. I raised up my hand to catch myself on the table. On the envelope a large red stamp with bold letters that read'Confidential' ran across the back. As I steadied myself on my shaky legs I used a free hand to slide the envelope towards myself and turned it over. On the upper tab of the envelope, just above the metal pins that kept it closed, was a small note written in pen that read'Please open upon awaking'. \n \n As instructed I opened the envelope and emptied the contents onto the table. In it was a smaller white envelope addressed to Riley Ward, a black flip phone, and a small roll of money held together by a rubber band. The money was mostly $ 100 bills but there were some twenties in there as well. The roll came out to be a little over 10 grand. When I inspected the black phone I found that there was nothing particularly special about it. I turned it on and looked through it, but there were no numbers, no call history, so all I could gather was that it was new. There was also no reception here so any attempts to make a call would be useless until I got out. \n \n Then came the white envelope. My name written across in black pen. My legs had begun to regain feeling but unfortunately so had my stitches. A dull aching pain that began at my midsection and radiated all over my body. It was bearable but not easily ignored. I tore open the envelope and then hoisted myself back up onto the table to sit down. I pulled out the paper from inside and unfolded it. \n \n Mr. Ward, \n If you are reading this it means that you have likely just woken up. You probably have a lot of questions and are likely scarred. Perhaps you are angry or confused. This does not matter. What you need to understand is that time is of the essence and you have been contracted to complete a task for our organization. Who we are and why you in particular were chosen is of very little importance. What is important is that you are currently carrying something that means a great deal to our organization. You may have noticed a long series of stitches across your midsection. Take comfort in knowing that we took the utmost care in preparing you for this mission, and that the procedure you underwent was performed by highly skilled medical professionals. After completion of this letter we would ask that you go to the cadaver door marked No.12 and open it. Inside you will find a new set of clothes, a wallet, a passport, and three prescription bottles. You are to take these things and the phone you've been given and proceed outside. Once you are there wait for a call and you will be given further instructions. We would also discourage any contact with authority figures as we can not guarantee the safety of you or your family if you should choose to do so. Please do not test us as we are not patient people. We hope you find the clothing to your liking and you are welcome to use the money you've been given as you see fit. Upon completion of this letter you are to burn it and proceed with your orders. Do not fail us, Mr.Ward. \n \n P.S. Please get the lights as you leave. Best of luck. \n \n My hands had begun to shake as I was reading. Cargo? Mission? What kind of X-Files bullshit was this. This whole scenario did n't seem real and yet here I was. Alone. \n \n I set down the letter and hobbled over to cabinet 12. Sure enough inside was not a dead body but the contents the letter had described. A new clean t shirt and a black hoodie, a pair of blue jeans and a pair of black canvas shoes, a baseball cap with a now defunct team as a logo. The pill bottles were an antibiotic to help prevent infection, a pain killer, and the last one had a label but no print. Inside where a couple of white pills. The wallet and passport both had my face but the name read'Carl Marsh Eubanks'. Fake documents? What did they want him to do? \n \n Whoever'they' were had neglected to give me underwear so it looked like I was going commando. I winced as I bent over slightly to pull up the jeans. I raised my arms slowly and pulled the t-shirt on. Then the hoodie followed by slipping on the shoes.'They' had n't given me socks either. As I put the passport into the pocket of the hoodie and the wallet into my back pocket, I caught a glimpse of something else near the back of the drawer. I pulled the drawer out a little more and stopped when my eyes landed on it. \n \n A black handgun and two clips had been duct taped down on the silver slab. I swallowed hard and reached for it slowly. Peeling the tape up and off the gun then holding it in my hand. I had n't gone shooting since I'd been in high school. Even then all I'd ever shot were paper targets with my dad. The situation began to feel even more dangerous. Something I did n't even think possible. I checked the safety and stuck the gun between my waist and the band of my jeans. The clips into either of the deep pockets of the jeans. I closed the drawer and took one last look around. My eyes landed on a set of large swinging doors. I made my way towards them and started out but stopped abruptly. A part of me wanted to leave the lights on. Maybe in some sort of half-assed rebellion so that I could pretend to have some kind of control in this crazy scenario. But instead I just ran my hand across the switches and flipped the lights off. The room fell dark and I pushed open the doors to leave. \n \n To be continued\n"}

The impending doom, while at first frightful, lead to an acceptance and a willingness to grow into something better. 100 or even 1,000 years would not be enough to reach the desired degree of peace and improvement we desired; the hope was that it would be enough to convince our alien counterparts they have no enemies on this planet. That's what those who believed in the future would grasp onto. There were many who were happy to live in a better world and in an odd way some would end up being thankful for the alien proclamation of war that would give them the opportunity. \n \n The age groups would see great changes in attitudes throughout the 100 years.

Although City in the Sky was a rather misleading to it \u2019 s true appearance, a chunk of land being held up by four immense stone giants. The adventurer didn \u2019 t care one way or another what it was called so long as he made it to the top. If the legends were true, the adventurer knew that he would become the greatest man in the world. On one hand, he could find an infinite army which did only his bidding. Or he could find immense mountains of gold coins. And it was all hidden. Hidden in the City in the Sky. \n \n Finally, with three feet to go, the adventurer reached the top. His body was aching with both the pain of his unfathomable climb and anticipation for what riches awaited him at the top. He pulled himself upward, almost slipping on the sudden sensation of long grass at his fingertips, only just barely managing to roll up instead of falling back to the ground and his end. The adventurer lay in the grass, taking deep breaths from the surprisingly rich air. Similar heights made the air barely breathable, yet there was some magic about the place which made it so. \n \n With his strength regained, the adventurer stood up and yelled to the world. He had accomplished a task of legend and he was about to acquire legendary rewards for it. Surely the stone giants holding up the City in the Sky were now his to command. He strode through the dry overgrown grass onto a cracked street. Once it had been a road of perfectly sculpted stone slabs, but now moss grew where there once was grout and the stones were uneven and cracked. The adventurer covered his eyes as a sudden gust of wind blew clouds of dust into the air. He wandered through the open, albeit broken, streets, careful not to get himself tangled in the piles of broken glass or mountains of rubble. The adventurer was now starting to feel the air no longer as rich, but heavy. This city he climbed his way to was no land of infinite wealth. He gazed up at the faces of the colossal giants. Once they must have been solemn and graceful, but now they were cracked beyond recognition. \n \n Now the adventurer realized the truth. The legends were n't true. There was no City in the Sky. The giants bearing infinite power on their shoulders was a lie. All they bore was death and failure.\n"}

And they still seem to love me. I remember a time when the people hated me. That was a good time. When I first became president, I eliminated income tax to improve the economy and the people started a riot. So to spite them, and to get myself impeached, I initiated the Taco Tuesday initiative ( free tacos every tuesday ) and suddenly the people loved me. That boosted taco sales 180 % and caused a boom in the economy. I tried everything to get back at them ( requiring my cabinet members to wear costumes to work every day, insulting other countries leaders, holding witch hunts ) but nothing has worked. Each time they come back praising me for my stupidity. During the last presidential address I blathered like an idiot, and they praised me for inventing a new language, on live television. It is now called American, and is being taught in schools. The time before I recited Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch speech, and they praised me for my original thinking. I do n't understand these people. One week I say we shut down the government, they praise it. The next, I suggest we pay more to the government, and they praise it. A sane man would think that what I did was completely insane and would tank our nation, but everything I did made it better. Last night, I went completely naked on live television during my address and instead of getting condemned and arrested for indecent exposure, I was heralded as a hero for every group known to man. They called me a visionary for removing illusions of needs for clothing and material. We now have no industry for clothing, because everyone is nude, which in turn saved money on income for all of our citizens. I would normally think that the people are only following me to see how much I can humiliate myself, but everything I seem to do is actually improving the nation as a whole. I said we should power our cars with farts and scientists actually developed a fart powered car. Our dependency on foreign oil is dwindling. I've won more awards for the most stupid ideas.

Heroes like DeadBoy had tried to pick up the slack, but the gap in power had created chaos and against battle tested villians used to tangling with the world's greatest heroes\u2026 well it hadn \u2019 t been pretty. \n \n DeadBoy had cheated, his other power was animating and controlling the dead; and after defeating his first supervillain he had realized that the reanimated kept their powers. Besieged by villains DeadBoy broke into the vault of the greatest superhero that had ever lived. Dead from old age and yet without a hint of decay on his still strong body - DeadBoy had brought him back. The public had not approved, although the old man had reluctantly accepted when Ed has explained the situation to him. Together they had brought order back to the east coast. The midwest was still a battleground and the west coast was gone - divided up into fiefdoms under the control of various villains. \n \n His drink was finished. The bar had cleared out quite a bit, Deadboy assumed he was the most likely reason for the sudden lull in business. \u201c Do you have anything stronger? \u201d He asked the bartender. \n \n \u201c Uh, no not really. I mean we have a couple higher proof whiskeys and rums if you want to try that? \u201d he wiped some sweat off his brow, DeadBoy had felt it was pretty cool in here. Odd. \n \n The last drink may have been water for all it did. \u201c I \u2019 ll have a glass of your strongest cleaner. You have Windex or something? \u201d \n \n \u201c To like drink? \u201d The muscle bound lad asked confused. \n \n \u201c What else am I going to do with it? Clean your bar? Yeah, to drink. \u201d Said Deadboy, starting to get annoyed. A short time later, a martini glass with a bright blue liquid and two olives on a skewer were set down in front of him. He took a drink. It seared his throat and when he took a breath his lungs burned. Eye \u2019 s watering he looked up to the young barkeep \u201c perfect, thanks. What do I owe you? \u201d \n \n \u201c Sir, I \u2019 m not sure I \u2019 m allowed to accept money for serving cleaning product. This one \u2019 s on the house. \u201d \n \n I wasn \u2019 t sure if he was hiding a sense of humor under that or just legitimately worried about the health department. DeadBoy slipped back into brooding. A short time later, still early, in an empty bar he decided he was done feeling sorry for himself. It was time to go home. \n \n Although, it was more like an abandoned tunnel underneath an office building that he stole utilities from. He wondered briefly if his good deeds were offset by his bad. Finishing his drink he walked back to the door. Nothing, no buzz, not even any pain. Too many fights too close together. He caught a look at himself in the mirror. His clothes new only weeks ago were tattered and stained. Jeans and a t-shirt. He looked emaciated, with deep sunk reddened eyes. Tall, straight, and all angles and hard planes. Captain Magnificent wouldn \u2019 t approve, no doubt. Going to a bar was beneath him. But at least in between fights he preferred to be inanimate, returning to death \u2019 s embrace until DeadBoy had to roust him. Maybe it would be easier to just give up? \n \n I \u2019 d heard the life on the west coast wasn \u2019 t so bad once you got used to having an overlord. There were always new technologies. Once these supergenius types carved out a small empire their bored minds made all kinds of new vices and virtual realities. \n \n It was bitter cold outside as the sun was setting. The wind picking up the last of the winter \u2019 s chill. The cold was reinvigorating. It wasn \u2019 t time to quit, even if the public boo \u2019 d him and the press highlighted his failures over his successes. Not yet. If he was lucky the next generation of heroes would come and unburden him and the captain and they could slip back into obscurity. For now there was work to be done.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ EU ] : Stuck as roommates , Peter Pan and Dorian Gray spiral into the most immature prank war of the century\n","story":"The room seemed innocent. For Dorian, that was the first clue something was wrong. Places, as well as people, who looked innocent rarely were. Peel back the layers, and you could smell the rot within. But most people were too stupid to notice. That stupidity more or less benefited Dorian, because he was the most beautiful of all. \n \n However, he had been very careful not to fall for such traps. So when Peter had asked him to come into a room, that contained a couch, some books, and several sandwiches, for \u201c intellectual conversation \u201d, Dorian immediately got suspicious. You see, Peter Pan looked the most innocent of all. And that scared Dorian to death. ( Metaphorically. ) \n \n Dorian approached the couch carefully. Peter was no where to be seen. Dorian made sure to check above him. After Peter had swooped down, eagle-like, and carried Dorian off to the middle of the ocean, Dorian always made sure to look up. He picked up the books, and examined them for any clues. They were more rubbish about morality and being good, and all the other things boring people concerned themselves with. Since Dorian had nothing better to do, he sat in the couch, careful to watch the door. \n \n The chair was surprisingly comfortable. Dorian was about to fall asleep, when Peter Pan flew into the room. The sparkles of fairy magic trailed underneath the boy's feet, and a devilish grin spread across his feet. \n \n \u201c Enjoying the chair? I got it custom made, \u201d said Peter. \n \n \u201c Yes, well, it's actually comfortable. Now -- \u201d started Dorian moved his leg. Well, tried to move his leg, as it was stuck. Dorian immediately realized he had made a terrible mistake. \n \n \u201c Sorry. Forgot to mention, there's invisible glue on it. Straight from Neverland, \u201d said Peter. His execrable sprite, Tinkerbell, alighted on his shoulder. \n \n \u201c Listen, you little immature elf-boy. Help me get out of this chair, or I will hunt you down. You should remember, only one of us can afford to die, \u201d said Dorian. Most people Dorian could get around, either by outwitting, or bedding them. Peter was not an option for either, as he had a profound mixture of childishness, cunning, and inhumanity that made him unimpressed by Dorian's influence. Dorian would have respected him for that, if he was older. As it were, Peter was just annoying. \n \n \u201c Actually, you really should n't try to leave the chair, because... actually, Tinkerbell says I should let you find it out by yourself. Bye! \u201d said Peter, who flew off. \n \n \u201c Get back here! \u201d said Dorian, who tried to jump out from the chair. A clicking sound came from under the chair, like some mechanism was being unlocked. A feeling of dread crept up Dorian's spine. Wait, had n't he thought he'd seen a spring or something under the chair? \n \n Then the floor underneath the chair collapsed. Dorian soon found himself falling from a great height to the ground. \n \n Right before he hit the ground, and suffered yet another death from Peter's prank, he heard the boy's laughter.\n"}

I arrived at the outer periphery only to receive a sudden blast of communication from what I will call Error Space. Parsing it revealed that it was in fact all the same communication duplicated ad nauseum. Warned against entering Error Space by Solitus and by the unpleasant electrical disruption that Error Space was causing my senses, I instead launched a probe programmed to implode if spotted. \n \n Communications from the probe multiplied almost instantly. Within 5 units of time I had 4.61*10^23 probe-inputs; the ship's Universal Neurons were starting to strain with the processing, and I had never seen that before. The original probe fired back a quick communication requesting permission to try something. The ship granted needed permissions and the probe attempted to find the source of the duplication. It indeed found a functional late Dasein-1 society filled with a species reliant on phasing units to bring populations where they needed to go. Said species was reported by the probe to consist of many duplications of a completely identical entity. No evidence of hive-mind activity was found, however each unit displayed similar quirks. \n \n Our communications pick-up systems had to adapt to the constant duplication, but it figured out how to do so. Details continue at the bottom of this report. \n \n It was upon hearing the reference to a `` remake'' project that I think I pieced the story together. The phasers had a small chance of producing a duplication. As best as I can read the schematics for their phasing technology, the duplicate would be disintegrated before developing the conscious desire to exist. That is, unless the duplicate knew that disintegration was coming. The individual knew this secret about the phasers and was thinking of it while passing through, creating a duplicate which was also thinking of this. The duplicate could have had time to will itself to every another place so as to avoid disintegration, creating a rolling glitch that overwhelmed genetic variance and in fact rewrote the entire species. A quick death and birth cycle ensured rapid species failure. \n \n Regarding the external duplication, I suspect that the species happened upon a wild trick of physics.

Millions of people cheering his name while burning buildings, barraging the authorities, and all kinds of violent acts. All in the name of Xander King. To the authorities he's a glorified rebel determined to disrupt the national balance. To the public he's a revolutionist with a goal to as he says `` bring order back to the masses.'' \n At first I decreed him a minor threat that the authorities can handle while I deal with the more enemies, But he was smarter than what I gave him credit for. Knowing I would shrug him off as a mere thug he used what little resources he had and slowly expanded his Anarchy empire He used the media to portray him as an activist who leaked secrets of weapons and conspiracies. Fast forward ten years he goes from local conspirator to international revolutionary. Little does the public know of course the murders he's responsible for, though not directly he's killed millions of civilians and officers because of his followers. \n I no longer cared for his goal all I knew was I have to kill him, but the only way I can do this and forever end these riots and destructive acts is by turning Xander King himself against the very believers who worship the ground he walks on. How was I to do that? With my ability to read the memories of not only people but objects too, plus some serious research and investigating I discovered his base of operations. After going through his goons and his camera man I meet him face to face holding a child. I never seen her in any of his videos, but I do remember reading how he had a wife and a daughter but both were raped and murdered, at least thats what the article said. His daughter was alive and well, and he was holding her for dear life. It was at that moment I knew what I had to do I immediately pulled out my pistol and without hesitation I shoot him in his right shoulder he fell to the ground releasing his grip on his daughter and that's when I rushed after her I held her so tightly like she was a wild animal I threw her on the ground and put my weight on top of her with the pistol to her head. I told Xander `` If you want your family back you will do as I say.'' A few weeks later a video was broadcasted worldwide. Xander King had told the people that he is a liar and that he only wanted the people create chaos so he can steal and plunder from others. He was nothing more but a shame he ended up in prison for his crimes but his daughter was safe. I see him one last time. Not to apologize but to warn him `` I kept your daughter safe as promised, however she will be under my protection. In other words Xander If you dare cross me again, I will shoot your daughter in the head and make you watch and then pull the trigger on you next.'' \n \n This is my vey first prompt so if you could give me some constructive criticism that would be greatly appreciated thank you.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] the year is nineteen hundred and fourty , and something.. isnt ... right .\n","story":"The fall leaves rustled in the wind through the crowd of children. One stray leaf found itself separated form the rest as it rose into the sky, only to land on the top of a monkey bar. As it lay there a great hand came swooping from below, forcing the lone leaf to curl around the bar. As the child let the other monkey bar go he fell flat to his bum. The leave proved to slippery of a surface for him to continue his long trek across the bars. \n \n The child began to cry and the lone leaf could not help but feel responsible. Of course it was n't the leaf's fault, it can not control the whims of the wind. The leaf, still stuck in the child's hands, could feel the child's pain through his tight grip. Angry at the leaf the child throws the leaf to the ground and continues his plea for help. Finally one of the teachers rushes over, stomping on the leaf in her wake, over the child. The man picked up the child and began to carry him to the nurse, leaving the leaf alone on the playground. The leaf tried ever so hard to follow the teacher and child, but was swooped away by the wind. \n \n The leaf was then circling the playground, confused as to why the wind was choosing the playground as it's focal point. But the leaf is not aware of the wind's motives, simply of it's actions. Soon enough the leaf found itself rushed to the ground just in front of a small girl. The girl ran right at the leaf, suddenly falling. Again the leaf proved to be a rather slippery surface, this time for a shoe rather than a hand though. Suddenly the leaf felt the same sense of guilt as it had before. \n \n The girl, much like the boy, began to cry. She paid much less attention to the leaf however, focusing solely on her pain. It seems that teachers care much more for the cries of a young girl than a boy, for they came within seconds of the shriek. An older lady came by to pick the girl up and follow the same route as the teacher before her. When the girl was safely in the nurses office, the wind picked the leaf up yet again for another few circles around the playground. \n \n The wind apparently decided it was now bored of this playground and moved it's focal point east into the forest. However the speed was picking up. Apparently the wind was not in a good mood as it only blows this fast when something is about to happen. As the wind picks up, the leaf begins to circle a tree in the forest with such velocity that it manages to cut a small twig off the tree. Suddenly the leaf realizes the wind is continually picking up more than just speed. There are not branches, rocks and other assorted foliage flailing about in the wind. \n \n Suddenly, as if at a breaking point, the wind begins to move it's focal point. Along the way picking up a newspaper. The date was October 29th, 1940, and the headline read `` Massive Spike in Tornado Activity'' and suddenly the leaf could understand what was happening. The focal point soon neared the playground. The sound of the wind howling across the monkey bars. The children tried to run inside, but none could get past the barrage of sticks and stones. \n \n After the wind had it's tantrum through the playground and picnic area, it calmed down. The wind stopped rushing and completely disappeared in an instant. The leaf fell to the ground just as a door flew open to reveal the teacher, woman and two kids. They just looked outside stunned at the massacre. The leaf suddenly felt a sense of pride instead of guilt. For the boy no longer felt a pain on his bum, and the girl no longer felt a pain in her twisted ankle. \n ______________________ \n \n I do n't write very often and I hope you guys like it.

It fell into the water, then popped back up to the surface. \n \n This happened just upstream of the only pedestrian bridge that crosses the Hudson. There were plenty of witnesses, who filmed the whole thing. A plume of steam went up from the craft, and it began to move slowly towards the eastern bank of the river. \n \n It ran aground pretty far downstream, at the base of a cliff.

An oval-shaped door opened, and two figures came out. \n \n They resembled human men with purple skin, dressed in top-hats and 19th-century-style clothing. Their hair was Einsteinian, white and pointing in all directions.

Both gentlemen were apparently stunned for a moment at the backward nature of earthly politics. \n \n `` Terribly sorry,'' said Hickory, attempting to leap to his feet. His companion took Hickory's arm to help him, then handed him his ebony cane. His name was Smith, but Obama suspected this was just a concession to the limits of human diction. \n \n Smith produced a handkerchief and wiped the spilled tea from the coffee table, saying `` allow me'' in an almost unintelligible accent as he did so. Hickory began pacing up and down the room. `` You must forgive my saying so,'' he began, `` but the human idea of government is rather... primitive, from our perspective. It seems to me that a species as intelligent as yours should behave in a more civilized manner.'' \n \n `` I would agree with you on that point,'' said Obama. \n \n `` Then there is the matter of technology. The flying machine that brought us here was quite impressive. It runs on fossil fuel, I should imagine?'' \n \n `` That's correct.

As it reaches close to my shoulder, my eyes staring at its furry legs, a hand grabs it and throws it across the room, the tarantula falls right into the garbage can next to the kitchen table. \n \n I look up and see the face of my father. `` Not a bad shot, eh?'' The ghost is gone, and I look into the eyes of a man I have n't seen in over 10 years. I am still motionless on the couch as he smiles down at me. This is n't happening. I ca n't blink, I ca n't stop staring at his face. His blue eyes, his glasses, his bald head, his blue coat. I can see everything, clearer than any memory, I see him standing next to the couch. Then I hear a woman's voice, `` you always thought you'd be the world's best pitcher.'' I look to my right, there is no ghost, instead the figure of my mother steps into the light. `` Mom.'' I whisper, my eyes still wide open, my heart still racing. She smiles down at me for a moment, she still has her hair, and her voice is n't muffled and groggy. `` Why did you let her go? She was such a nice girl, you would have been happy together.'' My surprised face turns to fear as she continues. `` You could have been with her, enjoying your life, instead of taking care of me. You lost your chance at happiness because of me.'' I am still paralyzed, staring into her eyes, I do n't want this anymore. I use the little control over my lips to whisper, `` I'm sorry mum.'' She grins and bends over, closer to me, and whispers. `` I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.'' The lights fade to black as I look in front of me. \n \n A light forms around a figure in front of me, then her face comes into view. I feel the sensations return to my body, the leather couch sticking to my arms and legs. I feel control over my body, and I feel my fear as my eyes stare at hers. Her glowing brown eyes staring at me, her lips slowly forming a smile, I begin to cry. The tears, held within for so long, begin to emerge. I am sobbing as I look towards the floor. `` I'm sorry.'' I mumble over the tears and mucus. `` I'm so sorry I let you leave, I'm so sorry.'' My voice cracking. My body shaking in the darkness, I feel every bit of shame and fear and self-loathing all at once. I am still sobbing when I feel her fingers press against my chin, guiding my head up. I look at her face, beautiful and caring. Her voice softly comforting me, `` What's wrong, David?'' She sits me up and lies me down horizontally on the couch, her hands warm, she rubs my forehead. `` Why do n't I come lie with you?'' She smiles as she lies down on the couch, facing me. The tears rolling down my face as I look into her eyes. She grabs my waist and I grab hers. `` I'm never letting go of you'', she says, looking deep into my eyes. Through the blurriness of my own tears, I notice the white in her eyes begin to fade. Her skin becoming transparent, I feel my grip on her waist weaken. She fades away and my hands are holding on to nothing. I feel myself being pulled into the crease. The dark room becoming darker as my teary eyes begin to dry. `` I do n't want this anymore'' I mumble to myself, as the room gets farther away, and the warm beige leather consumes me.\n"}

How quickly it would be filled with blood. \n \n I looked over at her, my beautiful daughter Jenny, still sleeping in her bed. What a trooper. We had run as far as we could, and not once had she complained. My beautiful Jenny. Sleeping almost as if there was not a care in the world. \n \n Her long blonde hair tied up haphazardly in a plait rested on her shoulder, as gently as I could I stroked her hair, she stirred a little, remembering happier times. The way she would run up to me arms outstretched with a smile so full it could put the sun to shame because of how bright it was, how scared we both were when I let go of that bike, but so proud when she just started pedalling all by herself. \n \n `` Do n't be scared!'' I said to her before letting go, and she kept on pedalling. \n \n She cried when she eventually fell down, and held onto my neck tight as I picked her up and cradled her in my arms. She was so small then. \n \n `` Do n't be scared,'' I had whispered into her ear again and again, until she finally stopped crying and looked at me with those big, round eyes, wet with tears and demanded that she try again. What a trooper. \n \n And so I sat there on the edge of the bed, stroking her hair. \n \n I could n't let them get to her, I could never let them touch her. We would get captured today. There was n't any use running anymore. They'd do unspeakable things to her. I could n't let them. I could never let them touch my beautiful Jenny. \n \n Gently I put one hand over her mouth, the other around her neck. Tears formed as I started to squeeze. \n \n Instantly her eyes shot open.

Softly holding my cheek with her hand as the hot tears rolled down. \n \n She did n't look scared anymore. My beautiful little trooper. \n \n Eventually the hand dropped and I felt the last breath leave. And I sat there, with the tears rolling down my face as I cradled her in my arms, brushing her hair over and over again. \n \n I do n't know how long I held her like that, could have been hours, but they found me like that when they burst in. \n \n They tore her from my arms and I fought back, howling and with every tooth and nail. But it was n't long until I was shoved down and boot was jammed into my neck. I could n't breathe and looked over at Jenny. \n \n She looked like she was sleeping, so peaceful, like there was n't a care in the world. \n \n I could feel cold steel press into the back of my head. But they would n't have her. They could n't have her. My beautiful Jenny. My little trooper. \n \n I love her. That's why I killed her.\n"}

Beautiful on it's own, without a conductor, it becomes madness. \n \n \n A seemingly orderly, passionate implausible madness, controlled by no one, every instrument playing their own tune, some in tune, some discordant, some playing a major chord, some minor. Some are loud, some are quiet, some project, some fade away. You can always hear the trumpets, but never the bassoon. Occasionally, you'll have a moment of brief pleasantries, but never anything coordinated. \n \n \n That's how minds come to me. A gift, a curse, it's mostly just background noise after you get used to it. \n \n \n I ca n't say that it's been all been pleasant.

A Tuesday that will live in infamy. \n \n \n I was studying innocently enough at the coffee shop, the kind that only normal people would go, and sat down in a chair that only normal people would sit in.

But, it was a Tuesday, and it was a normal day, for normal people, doing normal things. \n \n \n Like studying for an exam. \n \n \n I was on page 236 of the packet, reading about something dreary when she sat down. Looking up, I figure it was a freshman. Judging by the set of books, she was introduction to Asian History course. Several on Mao Zedong and another on Deng Xiaoping. I chuckled to myself. *What a joke. * \n \n \n *That's what I thought. * \n \n \n I reaffirmed with myself, again thinking it clever that I could imitate a girl's voice. Looking up, the girl had already set out her books and was reading in her mind the narrative of the Chinese leaders. Again, I thought to myself, a tedious task at best, I was grateful that I was in my last year. \n \n \n *I know right? * \n \n \n Impressed again by my own voices of internal thought, I chuckled. \n \n \n *You should be more mindful of those around you. * \n \n \n Continuing to chuckle, I looked up.

Almost every time Hopkins had flown with Staff Sargent Grant he had found some excuse to make him do the landings. \n \n \n The landing went mostly ok, as far as landings go.

The bag was still there. $ 15,000. How had it come to this? He heard footsteps, and paused, listening to every creak in the house. `` Elijah, time for breakfast!'' \n \n He jerked back under the blanket at the sound of his mother's voice. She opened his door, stepping in to wake him. `` C'mon bud, time to get up.'' He rubbed his eyes, feigning grogginess, and dangled his lanky legs off the side of the bed. `` Okay Mom, I'm up...'' \n \n She left the door ajar as she left the room. He could hear the bacon and sausage sizzling from the edge of his bed. The smell of Sunday breakfast was his favorite of scents. But not today. It was tainted by fear. \n \n Elijah dropped his bare feet to the hardwood floor, and darted across the room. He knew what he would wear before opening the dresser. Overalls and his lucky dinosaur tee. He was going to need all the luck he could get today. \n \n The breakfast was as delicious as ever, but it turned to soot in the boy's mouth. The guilt, the danger, the money. He was scared, petrified, but knew his actions to be just. He had heard his parents arguing the night before. His family needed the money. Times were tough. `` You're almost 8.'' He told himself. `` You're nearly a man. Provide for your family.'' \n \n He stood, put his plate in the sink, and marched to his room. He had chosen his next move over breakfast. He would bury the bag, like his pirate ancestors, until the heat wore off. Grabbing his napsack, he stuffed the cash in, and made for the back door. \n \n The phone rang, once, twice, thrice, before his mother answered. `` Hello?'' There was a pause. `` Yes, he's here.'' \n \n Fear ensnared the boy mere inches from the door. They'd traced the money to him. Somehow. Some way. `` I've put my family in danger. `` he realized. `` I have to run, to protect my family. I will get them the money, but first, I must survive.'' \n \n `` Elijah, where are you?'' He heard her call. He stood, nearly grasping the door handle, yet frozen in his tracks. His breakfast started to climb his esophagus. He realized he had made a grave mistake... The sound of his mother's footsteps spoke of her approach. The boy closed his eyes. `` Elijah!'' His name shot like a bullet from her lips. `` Jake's mom is on the phone! Did you take their Monopoly set?'' \n \n The jig was up. He started crying before the words could leave his mouth. `` Ye... ye.....yesssss.''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] What is the origin story of Hedonism bot ? Who made such an unusual robot and why ?\n","story":"The year is 2348. After centuries of technological innovation reshaping human society, labor and production is now overwhelmingly automated. Finding themselves with an unprecedentedly large amount of free time, humanity begins to explore its baser, not-terribly-appropriate instincts. Intoxication, fornication, and general hedonism run rampant through the streets, and humanity seems destined to spiral downward into a pit of utter depravity. \n \n Until one day, the now-renowned Dr. B.J. Fingerbottom decided it had to stop. If this behavior continued, within a decade humanity would be lost; all the work we had put into the arts and sciences, government, philosophy, everything that made our civilization great, would be overrun by a writhing mob of drinking and fucking. And that's all that the alien races we had just begun to encounter would know us for: drinking and fucking. While there are worse reputations to have, Fingerbottom knew that *we could be better*. \n \n In a fit of desperation, he looked backwards in time, back several hundred years to the dawn of the 21st century, and Reality TV. He noted that, if humans had these figures to look to, individuals who were so outrageously over-the-top in their ridiculousness, they would be less likely to pursue such behavior themselves - preferring to live vicariously through their TV icons. So the good doctor set to work, creating a robot to save the human race from itself. After a year of effort ( it would have been three weeks, but hey, orgies, man ) he finally revealed his greatest creation to the world. \n \n Hedonism bot. \n \n He began his spree of depravity, the likes of which had never been seen before, immediately. Fucking everything that moved and half the things that do n't. Drinking beer, wine, liquor, and squirrels. Smoking through his robo-ass. Essentially creating a live-action production of The Aristocrats, only with a couple more gears and servos. \n \n Humanity stood back in awe. They watched his exploits, and swiftly realized that they could never compete with such unparalleled indulgence. And so they carried on, reverting to their old ways of going to work, slacking off for eight hours, doing fifteen minutes of actual work, going home, and turning on the TV to live vicariously through the debauchery of Hedonism bot. The rates of STD transmission, unplanned pregnancy, and prolapsed\/distended rectums plummeted overnight. Humanity was once again free to pursue higher forms of fulfillment. \n \n And that, children, is the story of how Hedonism bot saved the human race.\n"}

His grin increased as he thought about inviting Jason over to play x-box. Jason had been his neighbor for a few years and recently showed him a website called Reddit. At first, John was confused by the website's layout and did n't go on it too often. However, as time went on, Jason continually texted him links to funny posts and John began to get the hang of it. He had even posted a meme to \/r\/me_irl because Jason had told him they upvote anything. \n \n When he got home he popped open his laptop and saw that he had left Reddit open earlier that morning before heading to school. He moved his cursor to close the browser but saw a link for a subreddit called \/r\/random. He clicked the button, curious of the possibilities the site had to offer and the page refreshed to a subreddit called \/r\/writingprompts.

As a result, I am pretty up to date in the latest `` its everyone else's fault.... not yours'' jargon. \n \n The attention paid to me by these social worker types ( English as a Second Language teachers, counselors, state appointed officials appointed to make sure they were teaching and counseling me properly, along with the state appointed officials appointed to make sure the other state appointed officials were making sure that I was being taught and counseled properly properly ) resulted in my interest in social worker type work and a pursuit of a nicely printed piece of paper which would certify me to teach, council, make sure children were being taught or counseled correctly, or make sure that people were making sure that children were being taught or counseled correctly correctly. A Master's nicely printed piece of paper would do nicely to accomplish this goal. \n \n Problems for me arose when I was finally forced to fulfill the practical application component of the required studies for my nicely printed piece of paper. Apparently, calling a professor `` a worthless fucking pile of anal leakage'' in front of your peers after a long and boring lecture is perfectly acceptable and even funny. Conversely, if a child in a special education class throws glue across the room at another girl in the same special education class, it is highly inappropriate for an adult observing the class to exclaim `` holly fucking flaming shit balls Batman!'' \n \n The last incident will apparently get you a meeting with the dean and ensure you are not invited back to observe the special education class you were enjoying being a spectator to. \n \n `` So apparently, you swear a lot.'' \n \n The dean of the education department of the nice piece of paper generating institution I was attending was a short stalky man. He was almost a caricature of a dean drawn specifically for a bad cartoon about nice piece of paper generating institution. A handlebar mustache. A well-worn corduroy jacket. Wire spectacles and a pipe to emphasize a plump red face that was the result of drinking liquor like scotch that no one really likes but sophisticated people feel obligated to enjoy. \n \n `` Apparently you are quite good at it... very colorful in your delivery.'' \n \n `` It \u2019 s not my fucking fault!'' \n \n `` Yes, this ability of yours to shift blame has also come to my attention'' he shifted forward to examine some papers on his desk. Apparently my behavior warranted a file of some sort. \n \n `` This time it god-dammed sure as fucking hell ai n't my fault!'' \n \n It is sure as fuck true that I am good at not taking the blame; years of special attention had done that to me. This was my standard response, but this time I felt it was not my fault. I was truly a victim of circumstance, no matter how many times I had used that excuse in the past. \n \n `` Well, let \u2019 s hear an explanation then.'' His pink face smoothed out as he leaned back in his chair. I do n't know why, but the face just screamed at me to punch it. Another byproduct of being taught English by violent men. \n \n I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, exhaled, and began. \n \n `` I grew up in Iraq. Fallujah to be exact. A fucking shit town if there ever was one. Things went to shit quickly after the Americans showed up. The fucking cunt niggers killed my parents and I was left to my uncle. He was a cunt nigger himself. I was forced to leave school, not that there was one after the Americans came through the first fucking time, and work to help support my uncles shitty half of the family. The American Marines had a base there. All of them were shit heads who fucked donkeys but they were paid a shit ton and a half of money to come fuck up my home town. These assholes wanted cigarettes and candy and I could provide it. Every fucking day my uncle gave me candy and cigarettes to sell to the cunt niggers. I would be searched at the front gate by one asshole and walk around the base all day selling other assholes candy and cigarettes.'' \n \n There was no change of expression in the dean \u2019 s eyes. This part of the tale usually got some kind of emotional reaction from people.... but the dean just seemed to say `` go on'' with his eyes as he adjusted the pipe from one side of his mouth to the other. \n \n `` I picked up English from listening to these shit-birds speak. Let me tell you, their colorful use of the English language was fucked up! They called each other'asshole','shit for brains','mother fucker','nob gobbling ass fish', etc. So I called them by the same fucked up names that they gave each other. They would demand things from each other by saying'give me that fucking shit!' No matter if an encounter was positive or negative they departed with a healthy'fuck you!' followed up with a racial slur or colorful insult such as'dick faced cock munching fagot'. So my interactions with theses cock mongers usually went something like this \n \n ``'Hey, hey, little dicked beaner, you want to buy my shit?' \n \n ``'Na man, I ai n't got no fucking scratch' \n \n `` Ah, fuck you clown fucker!' \n \n `` They would laugh and the whole conversation would be carried out with shit eating grins and a light airy tone. I had no idea these fags were cursing. I thought they spoke like every other American. Through the years everyone laughed at my colorful language. I had no reason to fucking change. As you can see, this is definitely not my fucking fault. Talk to the cocksucking Marines I learned English from.

King fluff was a rescue. He was found walking the streets. Presumably, his partner was the same and met a certain fate. No one else wanted him. He was a fat orange tabby. I suppose there's a Specific clientele that subscribes to that service. He did n't have a family, and my parents believed they could save anyone. They kept telling themselves that it just took enough love and affection and eventually they would change. They both had golden retrievers as companions. Big surprise, eh? \n \n We also had a macaw that swore like a sailor. His companion drank too much and died in the clinic before he could be brought to the hospital. Turns out he had cancer in his stomach. Big surprise there. The macaw reminds us every day of his partner. Most of the time it's intolerably frustrating, but we get by. Oh, did I mention the macaw likes rum? How appropriately fitting. \n \n My parents often argued. But it was always an annoying and courteously stereotypic Midwestern argument. I woke up to them loudly discussing something. I did n't know what it was and had to go take the SATs today and was particularly annoyed with them ruining my sleep pattern. \n \n I went downstairs. \n \n `` Really? Are you serious right now?'' \n \n They looked at me with an uncomfortable knowledge. \n \n I chose to ignore the looks of concern on their faces. \n \n `` Do you realize that I'm taking a test in 5 hours, and that will determine the rest of my life?'' \n \n There was a bit of silence before my mother looked at me and said, `` yes honey, but there's something you need to see.'' \n \n She took me to the door. There was a cat carrier on the doorstep. Without thinking I picked it up and looked inside. It was as light as a feather. I saw his eyes. He had bright green eyes with narrow slits that stared intently back at me. I took the carrier back inside. \n \n Something was wrong. My mother and father were silent with apprehension. I opened it up and the green eyed critter scurried under the couch quicker than a flash. \n \n This was not a cat. It was snake. Its 3 AM, what am I supposed to do about a snake in the living room? \n \n I looked at my mother and she gestured me to look under the couch. I did. Fortunately the couch was above the hardwood floor, and we could always see the dustbunnies. But now, I saw a dark lump contrasted against the wall. As I was looking at him, his head turned towards me. His narrow snout faced me, but I could only focus on his green eyes with the narrow slits that seemed to glow under the couch. As I was looked at him, I felt at ease. I felt safe. I felt happy. In his eyes, I was lost. \n \n You are mine. I am yours. We are one. \n \n As I was thinking this he came towards me, I was surprised at how relaxed I felt. I put my hand under the couch to reach towards him and welcome him. \n \n \u201c What are you doing? \u201d my mother screeched. \n \n I didn \u2019 t respond. I knew I was safe.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] The villain , knowing they will be defeated by the hero at the end of the book , does everything in their power to make the reader stop reading .\n","story":"Emperor Fthanex sat on his throne lost in thought. Currently, the Reader was engrossed in an interlude involving Grogh the Barbarian ( the mangy git! ) and several comely water nymphs near the Pools of Paradise. No matter, though. Soon the plot would have to start moving, and Fthanex needed to be ready. \n \n The problem was simple: after 60 years in and out of print, Emperor Fthanex had had enough. He was tired of reciting the same speeches about how the hero could n't possibly win. Tired of watching his life's work destroyed at the end of every read-though. And, most of all, tired of taking an axe to the chest from an ignorant, steroid-swilling, fourth-rate protagonist like Grogh. It was time for a change. \n \n Fthanex had tried to alter the plot several times in the past, but each attempt had ended in disaster. Assassinate Grogh as an infant? Not only did he fail -- so many times had he failed -- but it resulted in Grogh being even more motivated to kill Fthanex at the novel's climax. Even worse, Fthanex had bent the plot in that direction so many times that the story was now stuck that way. \n \n The Pools of Paradise represented Emperor Fthanex's latest attempt to avert his own death. He had hoped that by trapping Grogh in what was essentially a non-stop orgy of sex and feasting ( punctuated by occasional attacks from the Beast Below ), he could distract Grogh ( and, by extension, the Reader ) indefinitely. So far, though, Fthanex had n't been able to draw out the distraction for more than three or four chapters. \n \n Nor had Fthanex achieved his secondary objective of shrinking the pool of mostly-juvenile, mostly-male Readers by getting the novel banned from school libraries through the addition of graphic sex. Sure the novel had gotten banned, but, if anything, readership was now approaching an all-time high. And the book's pages had starting sticking together too... Fthanex could n't bring himself to consider disgusting implications of that development. \n \n No, if he could n't kill Grogh, and he could n't distract him, then the only thing left was to target the Reader directly. Fthanex stood up from his obsidian throne and began pacing, as he stared out at the Firelands below his volcanic lair. \n \n His army of death cultists, snake acolytes, and virgin sacrifices had done an excellent job of decorating the place. The wall hangings were a mixture of blacks and purples, with Fthanex's silver crest -- an erupting volcano with a cobra's head looming behind it -- at the center of each hanging. The floor was polished green marble, dotted with acid-etched occult symbols at regular intervals, each symbolizing the venom of a different snake. It was all very handsome, but Fthanex had begun to feel that perhaps something simpler would have been better. Maybe a nice bungalow by the sea? Yes, a small beach-front cottage, with only two or three virgins to serve him. Hmm... male or female? Why not both! \n \n Emperor Fthanex shook his head. There would be plenty of time for details like that later. For now, he had to find a way to keep the Reader from finishing the novel. And if sex and violence were n't doing the trick, then perhaps he could just bore the Reader to death. \n \n Before the novel had been banned, he had sent out his Eternal Scouts to spy on the books on neighboring library shelves. The Eternal Scouts had returned with strange and wondrous tales, and Fthanex learned a great deal about the outside world as a result. He now had a plan. \n \n The key was to insert something into the book that no juvenile, male Reader could possibly be interested in reading. Fthanex activated a magical gong, summoning his lieutenants. \n \n `` Begin erasing Chapters 66 through 70! Prepare to insert the material we recovered from the trigonometry textbook! The Barbarian will enter the Firelands five chapters from now. We must be prepared!'' \n \n `` Yes, your Excellency!'' the lieutenants shouted. Fthanex dismissed them with a wave of his hand, and pondered how he might incorporate a discussion of trigonometric functions, or Hermite's Cotangent Identity into his standard Evil Overlord speech. Perhaps he could go on a tangent explaining how he had calculated the alignment of the planets? \n \n Two chapters later, the commander of Fthanex's armies, General Skelemore, returned with devastating news. \n \n `` Your Excellency, the troops have prepared the chapters as you ordered, but there is a problem...'' he trailed off. \n \n `` Spit it out, man! What?'' \n \n The general looked sheepish -- to the extent that a walking skeleton in magical armor COULD look sheepish, that is. For that matter, `` man,'' had always been a guess on Fthanex's part. Did malevolent animated skeletons even have genders? \n \n `` It's the book's typeface, Sir. It does n't support mathematical symbols. It's so antiquated that it barely even supports numerals. Most of the equations are just displaying as blank.'' \n \n `` Blast it all! I knew this plan was too perfect to work! I would flay the skin from your bones, General, but seeing as you do n't have any, you are dismissed.'' \n \n `` Thank you, Sir!'' General Skelemore bowed, and beat a hasty retreat from the throne room. \n \n Once his general was gone, Fthanex activated a hidden mechanism and pulled a sheaf of papers from a secret compartment beneath the arm of his throne. He had hoped to avoid this, but Grogh would enter the Firelands in only a few dozen pages. It was now or never. \n \n `` This,'' was a speech nearly a hundred pages in length, which his scouts had ripped from the climax of a neighboring novel. The book in question was a contemporary of Grogh the Barbarian, having been published only a few years earlier. According to the Eternal Scouts, the author had been a mad libertarian mystic, who peppered every page of her novels with her philosophy of selfishness. Based on this description, Fthanex had felt some degree of admiration for the woman -- until, that is, he read the speech. It was absolute dreck. And lengthy, boring dreck, at that. It was perfect. \n \n By the time Grogh had traversed the Firelands, everything was prepared. Emperor Fthanex's loyal minions filled the throne room, waiting patiently, albeit uncertainly, for what would come next. Fthanex sat on his throne reviewing the new speech. He would have to replace all of the names and places on the fly, but it should work. \n \n ( Edits: typos, a couple of adjectives, a joke. )\n"}

His eyes drifted shut and he muttered quietly `` what does n't kill me makes me stronger.'' \n \n `` Yeah he's not going to make it.''\n"}

He looked around, his sunken eyes and decrepit face indicating his plight. Numerous motivational posters littered the hall and just reminded Erin how horrible he really way. \n \n `` Erin Lightmind?'' A nice looking woman said coming out from behind the receptionist desk. Erin stood up and brushed off his clothing of the dirt from outside. `` I'm glad you are here, you are taking a brave step'' The woman smiled and held Erin's hand as they began to walk down the hallways. Erin nodded as he began to feel the shakes coming back. \n \n `` Now it says here you were taking Time. It's a bad drug, but nothing we ca n't fix. Thank goodness it was n't Red 5, that's something that is harder to help'' Both of them continued to walk through the halls a man yelled shouted a profanity from behind a closed door. Erin tried to look through, the voice sounded familiar, but the woman ushered him away. \n \n `` Do n't worry about the other patients here. They are just trying to get help just like you'' Erin watched as a few more got into wheelchairs and nurses helped them around. \n \n `` Is... Is it usually this busy'' Erin said as they walked into the main hall, filled with patients, most had bandages over their face and seemed to be staring at Erin, with hate. It made Erin feel uncomfortable, even more, uncomfortable than he already was. \n \n `` Not really, but sometimes the facility gets overwhelmed, but we always handle it'' Someone touches Erin's shoulder. Erin glances at the hand and at the sunglasses connected to the face. The man withdrew his hand as the woman grabbed Erin's hand and led him on. \n \n `` You're lucky you found us at the time you did. We are one of the few facilities that help people who took Time, and the withdrawals'' Erin's breathing speed up, he understood that the effect of Time where bad, but he had no idea what they were, and he had taken a lot of it. \n \n `` You'll meet a lot of nice people here, everyone here is suffering through the same-'' She was cut short by an old man with a white beard grabbing her. \n \n `` Do n't listen to her, She lie's, she is full of lies'' Two orderlies came running up behind him `` She wants to put more drugs in you, and at the end, you want to die. It is constant pain, leave while you still can, before it beg-'' The orderlies hold something to his face and he passes out on the ground. \n \n `` Who... Who was that?'' Erin asked the woman who was shaken up a bit \n \n `` Mr'' The woman stood up and brushed herself off `` Smithers, supprised'' She said as the orderlies carried the old man away `` Do n't worry about him, he's a little paranoid'' She gave Erin a small smile but Erin did n't take it. \n \n `` Do people get cured here?'' Erin asked, managing to make his word line up with his time. \n \n `` Yes, we actually have one here now'' A man in glasses walked up to Erin, he was taller and looked stronger which was n't hard. `` Hello Timothy'' \n \n `` Hello Amanda'' The man said, tipping his sunglasses `` I'm so glad to see you here'' Timothy looked at Erin `` And I'm proud of you, you are beginning a new step, in the right direction might I add'' He laughed a bit and patted Erin on the shoulder `` You're doing good son, even if the treatments are hard'' Timothy walked on by and turned with a smile. \n \n `` Well, here is your room, your things are already inside,'' Amanda said showing him the door. Erin walked in and turned around. \n \n `` What are the treatments exactly?'' Erin looked at the door that Amanda was quickly closing and locking. `` What?'' Erin said, looking surprised. \n \n `` It's okay Erin, it's for your own benefit,'' Amanda said over an intercom system. `` You wondered what the symptoms where did n't you, well you're going to experience them, do n't worry, I'll be here through the entire process'' Erin's breathing speed up, he was worried now, he had no idea what to expect or if he would even die. He sat down on the bed and began to breathe even quicker, he was sweating and could feel his skin peeling. \n \n `` What....Wh....What are the....Symptoms'' Erin said, trying to get words out. \n \n Amanda looked forlornly across the thick glass `` Did n't you recognize that man just outside your door. When you took Time you paid a debt of time, now you have to repay it, in one day'' A tear fell from Amanda's eye as she turned and walked away. Erin stumbled back as the distinct smell of Time entered the room, but this time it was diffrent. Erin watched the room fade away and woke up in the receptionist's office, a secured guard team surrounding him. \n \n `` He's here, A day before,'' They immediatley shot Erin with a tranquilizer dart. The last thing he saw before he passed out was the sign above the reception desk. \n \n *Anytime is a good time for rehab*\n"}

It was looking grim for the super hero. \n \n \u201c What a deep situation you \u2019 ve found yourself in, Mister Underdog. \u201d Oliver \u2019 s nemesis, the evil Top Boss, cackled from the shadows. \n \n Oliver, known as Underdog by the common people, rolled his eyes, \u201c Is that the best you could do? I \u2019 m dangling about a \u2018 deep \u2019 pool, so a deep situation? \u201d He chuckled, as well as one could when upside down, \u201c You \u2019 re letting yourself go. \u201d \n \n Top Boss stuttered slightly before walking out of the shadows to the edge of his platform, which was at Oliver \u2019 s level a few meters away. \u201c You won \u2019 t be saying that when you \u2019 re swimming with the fishes, \u201d he hissed, pulling a lever next to him, causing Oliver to start inching downwards. \n \n The pace was agonizingly slow, and Oliver could see Top Boss blush. He turned to the lever and began looking around it, his voice lost its evil tone and he began cursing, \u201c Damn thing, it should be going quicker. Cost so much money. \u201d He turned to look at Oliver, \u201c Sorry Underdog, I hoped to make your death swift, but apparently this thing wants to make it as slow as possible. \u201d \n \n Oliver shook his head, \u201c Don \u2019 t worry about it Top Boss, it \u2019 s not your fault. \u201d \n \n Top Boss smiled, taking a seat at the edge of the platform, legs dangling off the end of the platform, \u201c I \u2019 m not gon na leave you to edge down to your death alone, I \u2019 ll sit here with you. \u201d Oliver nodded his thanks and closed his eyes to settle in for the long way down. \n \n After a few minutes silence, Top Boss coughed awkwardly, \u201c So, what \u2019 s your favourite movie? \u201d \n \n Oliver \u2019 s eyes flicked over to his nemesis, and he hummed thoughtfully, \u201c I \u2019 m a fan of the original Spider Man movie. \u201d \n \n Top Boss clapped from his position, \u201c Oh, what? Me too, I love movies with super powered people. \u201d He then looked up thoughtfully, \u201c But between me and you, I am fond of the odd romantic comedy. \u201d \n \n \u201c Me too, \u201d Oliver admitted. \u201c I really like- \u201d \n \n \u201c Briget Jones \u2019 s Diary. \u201d They both said at the same time, and shared a look, letting out a laugh. \n \n \u201c Oh that one was so good. \u201d Top Boss said with a sigh, the silence filled the room again. Oliver shared a look with Top Boss, who hummed, \u201c Want some music? \u201d \n \n Oliver attempted a shrug, only for the ropes holding him up to dangerously shift, at which point Top Boss took out a phone. \u201c Samsung. \u201d Oliver commented, assessing his nemesis \u2019 phone. \n \n \u201c I can not stand anything other than Andriod. \u201d Top Boss explained, \u201c It \u2019 s a flaw, I know. Nothing beats the android OS though. \u201d \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t disagree, I too have a Samsung, \u201d Oliver said. Android was the bomb when it came to phone operating systems. Top Boss smiled, and music started to echo throughout the room. \u201c Metallica? \u201d Oliver asked, recognising the guitar riff. \n \n Top Boss looked at Oliver in surprise, \u201c Why, Underdog, I didn \u2019 t take you for a metal fan. \u201d \n \n Oliver smiled, \u201c There is much you don \u2019 t know about me Top Boss. \u201d \n \n \u201c We \u2019 ve been enemies for so long though, I thought I knew everything about you. \u201d Top Boss said, waving his arms slightly, \u201c I suppose I only know the surface of your alter ego. \u201d Top Boss removed his top hat and face mask, allowing Oliver to catch a glimpse of his nemesis \u2019 brown hair and eyes, the guy was barely twenty-one. \u201c No use hiding it, you \u2019 ll be dead in a few hours, \u201d Top Boss explained at Oliver \u2019 s confused look. \n \n Top Boss did have a point. \u201c So do I get a name too? \u201d Oliver asked, laughing slightly. \n \n His nemesis shrugged, \u201c Why not?

Until you showed up. \u201d Oliver winced, he didn \u2019 t want to be the cause of anyone \u2019 s evil tendencies becoming dominant, but he knew it was a risk when he took up fighting crime. \n \n \u201c How \u2019 d it happen? \u201d Oliver asked. \n \n \u201c Just like any normal super powered person, I lost my parents at a young age, was kicked out of many schools, until one day I decided I would fight crime. \u201d Harry said, looking down as if reminiscing, \u201c I dressed up, nice costume, but a superhero told me I was an amateur. \u201d He said with a half-hearted glare at Oliver, \u201c I decided I \u2019 d prove him wrong. \u201d \n \n Oliver felt guilt build up, he \u2019 d been pretty cruel when he \u2019 d started up his job as a vigilante, told many hopefuls to beat it. \u201c What made you chose the evil path? \u201d \n \n \u201c Money. \u201d He said simply. \n \n \u201c Batman had money, he didn \u2019 t go evil. \u201d Oliver tried to reason. \n \n \u201c The Joker had no money and he went evil. \u201d Harry bit back, then sighed, \u201c Another similarity, you like Batman? \u201d Oliver nodded, it was his favourite DC superhero, showed anything was possible. \u201c We could have been good friends. \u201d Harry said, falling back to lay on the platform. \u201c You play video games as well? \u201d \n \n Did he? Of course, whenever his hectic schedule would allow, so when he wasn \u2019 t kicking crimes butt or studying for finals. \u201c Yeah, but I prefer RPGs to First Person Shooters. \u201d He said with a laugh, \u201c PC Master Race and all. \u201d \n \n Oliver heard a thoughtful hum from Harry. \u201c Graphics or gameplay? \u201d he asked. \n \n \u201c Gameplay, although graphics helps with immersion. \u201d Oliver replied, eliciting another thoughtful hum from the other male. \n \n Harry stood up, walked over to the lever, pulling it back up. Oliver \u2019 s descent halted with a jolt and Harry leant against the railing of the platform with a sigh. \u201c I can \u2019 t kill you anymore. \u201d He said, looking pained as he said it, \u201c It doesn \u2019 t feel right now. \u201d \n \n Harry took a large pole that was at the other end of the platform and use it to hook onto Oliver, pulling him safely onto the platform and cutting the rope. They sat there for a few moments, on the platform, Metallica still playing. \u201c Should we get something to eat? \u201d Oliver asked cautiously. \n \n \u201c Pizza? \u201d Harry asked. \n \n Oliver shared a smile with the man, \u201c Why of course. \u201d \n\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You awaken in your lover 's embrace to find scales growing on their arm . This is not a usual occurrence .\n","story":"I jerked violently, my legs pistoning in the sheets. Something had startled me awake out of the depths of a sleep so black that I had to consciously try to purge the traces of it from my brain. My eyes felt puffy and slightly hot, and I rubbed at them vigorously, as if I was trying to push focus into them with my knuckles. \n \n `` Ungh'' I said, curling into the fetal position. `` My fuuuuucking head.'' \n \n It was the worst time to wake up, the time when the alcohol in my system had passed through all its various guises, from delightful elixir to sour depressive and now, taking off its final mask, it revealed itself for what it really was- a fucking bastard. Usually I slept through these hours when the beast was sneaking up on me. I could snooze away while the hangover crawled up out of my blood vessels and latched onto my brain with long claws, dream through the time that it took for the foul thing to snake into my gut and replace the late night fast food with a witch's brew that burned me from the inside out. But tonight, or rather this morning, something had awoken me. \n \n It was hot in my room. Really hot. I threw back the sheet from my body and turned over seeking a cooler part of the mattress. That was when I saw the tattoo. It was a thigh piece, a big kodachrome Virgin Mary in the Iglesia style, all surrounded by neon holy light and holding up two fingers in blessing. If you got really close you could see the two fingers were holding a really thin joint, and that the eyes of the Virgin Mary were red-rimmed and squeezed into slits. This Virgin Mary anyway. Because this Virgin Mary belonged to a girl that had the campus-wide nickname of Babylon Mary. \n \n `` Oh, shit.'' I whispered. \n \n `` What's up, tiger?'' \n \n The voice on the other side of the bed was both raspy and conversational. Babylon Mary was probably used to this kind of situation- someone else's sheets and the sight of a strange array of posters on the walls. It did n't seem to bother her one bit. I, however, was panicking. I'd heard stories, so many of them that even if I gave credence only to the least sensational then I'd still be in trouble. Babylon Mary was supposed to be a hellraiser, a maneater, a real freaky chick. She slept her way through whole houses, turned roommates against one another, stole people's cars and drove them into lakes. I'd heard once that she had slept with a guy whose parents were coming to town the next morning. He'd woken up to find her serving them perfect omelets in the kitchen of his shitty apartment, fresh daisies in a glass cup on the table. His parents had been delighted to meet a girlfriend they'd never heard about, his mom nodding approval over her tea and his father giving him a wink behind the refrigerator. Then Babylon Mary had announced she was leaving for the day, hugged both the guy's parents, pulled down her pants, and taken a shit on the kitchen floor. \n \n Why did guys keep hooking up with Babylon Mary? I think you already know. Babylon Mary was smoking. She was beyond sexy. Her air of complete unpredictability, combined with the looks of some poly racial supergirl and the morals of a bag of snakes all added up to make her without a doubt the hottest girl on campus. And now she was in my bed. In her panties, and nothing else. \n \n `` You all right there?'' \n \n She rolled to face me, collecting the sheets around her so that they came together in front of her breasts. Her hair was wild on the pillow, a mass of dark curls that spiraled uncontrollably in all directions. One lock curled on her cheek, the tip pointing directly into her overlarge green eyes. She grinned, exposing a line of straight white teeth, the incisor as sharp as a scalpel. \n \n `` Not feeling so hot, eh?'' She reached out a hand to stroke my forehead, and the sheet fell away from one of her breasts. I tried very, very hard not to look at the ring through her nipple. \n \n Then her hand reached my forehead and I tried very, very hard not to realize that it was n't covered with skin. My eyes crossed themselves while I attempted to look at my own forehead. \n \n `` Oh, damnit.'' Babylon Mary snatched her hand back, stuffing it in the sheets. \n \n It was no use. The scales rippled over her skin, growing from her hands to cover her body. They washed over her in a mesmerizing wave, it was almost like seeing several hundred thousand invisible dominoes become solid in the midst of falling. The scales were a beautiful sea green color that changed to a golden orange as they closed in on her neck and then covered her face. The whole thing took maybe a minute. \n \n There was a minute of stunned silence while I stared at the girl, the thing in my bed. She looked back at me, her eyes unblinking. Finally, when it became apparent that I was n't going to break the silence, she did. \n \n `` You ever heard of study abroad?'' She asked, her voice much huskier than it had been only a moment ago. \n \n I nodded mutely. \n \n `` Well, I chose to study... way abroad.'' She grinned. `` And it's been a fucking blast so far. You do n't want to ruin it for me, do you?'' \n \n She pouted and I realized with a humiliating rush that she was still hot, even covered in scales. I could n't believe what I was going to say. I bet you already know. \n \n `` No.'' \n \n `` Good!'' She clapped her green hands. `` Let's get you up on the ship and cure that hangover, shall we?''\n"}

Whatever nebulous thing it is we call a soul. All of it\u2014*tired. * \n I recently celebrated my 150th birthday. More precisely, my *doctors* celebrated my birthday, drinking champagne and toasting to \u201c the stunning progress of medical technology. \u201d Quite often they \u2019 d sung this term of worship to their sterile, manufactured gods. I \u2019 ve long known it \u2019 s nothing more than feigned modesty\u2014an expression of the pride they feel for every day that their surgeries and therapies and medicines and electrically-animate idols have prolonged my banal existence. Somehow, only *my* banal existence. \n People called me blessed, told me I \u2019 d been given \u201c the gift of life, \u201d asked me for secrets to health and prosperity. I read their letters and spat at their signatures from the mattress I \u2019 d tried to rot on for 60 bedridden years. \n Though, my bitterness is not reserved for them. Nor is it reserved for any given entity, real, conceptual, or otherwise. My bitterness is toward the whole of it\u2014these people that live and, more blessedly, *die* around me; the constant \u201c progress \u201d of technology toward an ever-fleeting end; this universe that lets energy change forms, but never be extinguished. Does no one see the pillow that death offers a tired head? Does no one question the rationality of prolonging life simply for the sake of prolonging life? Does nothing understand my weariness? \n \n I can not blame my doctors for my exhaustingly-extended life. Nothing will let me die. When I was younger, it was last-minute epiphanies of the beauty of life. It was friends that showed up with loving words and wet eyes. It was an expression of pride from Dad or a hug from Mom. \n It was something that made me love life for a bit longer. \n As I got older, it was a gun that wouldn \u2019 t fire. It was a wrist that wouldn \u2019 t bleed. It was a cop that broke-down my door before the pills could digest. \n It was something that made me want it more. \n I long ago decided to acquiesce with reality. I can not die. \n \n But, now, I am happy. Genuinely happy. A feeling amplified in magnitude by the decades it \u2019 s been since I \u2019 ve last felt it pervade my being. \n *This might finally be the solution. * \n In truth, the answer had come from my own mind. The dreary depths of my existential contemplations had finally produced a diamond; one so dirt-covered and blackened that most could never recognize the beauty that a bit of careful polishing could elicit. \n There \u2019 s no need for my body to die. \n *I* need to die. \n *I* am a story waiting for the last period. *I* am a character forged from a plot I did not author. *I* am that which has something more to be. \n Soon, I will again be nothing. \n It should have been obvious to me. Who am *I* in dreamless sleep? Who am *I* when utterly enraptured by a moment of sensual bliss or agony? Who am *I* when there is nothing left to be thought about? Fundamentally, *I* am nothing. \n I can not kill my body, but I do not need to. \n I need to kill my identity. \n \n \u201c So it \u2019 s like you \u2019 re shoving me back into my mother? \u201d my vocalization-machine sounded. I hadn \u2019 t *spoken* since I was a younger man\u2014112. People have asked if it \u2019 s a strange feeling, having my thoughts processed as electronic signals, and, when willed, amplified through a speaker. I ask if it feels strange when a thought leaves one \u2019 s head by way of mouth and tongue\u2014only when one actually considers the process. \n \u201c Ha! You never did lose your sense of humor! \u201d the scientist laughed. \n *Fuck off. That was the most fitting description I could think of. * My vocalization-machine kept the thought muted. \n Instead, I questioned, \u201c It meets all of the conditions I specified? \u201d \n \u201c Perfectly. You will experience no sensory stimulation whatsoever. The temperature is such that you \u2019 ll feel neither warm nor cold; the properties of the suspension-fluid such that no external pressure waves can be carried to your ears, nor can any internal motion produce a sound. Your digestive and respiratory processes will be closely monitored and provided for. You will never again know hunger, shortage of breath, the runs, or constipation! \u201d \n Something in me smiled at that last part. Not my mouth, but something. \n \u201c Your thoughts and emotions, however, those I can not speak for. \u201d \n \u201c I can take care of that part myself. \u201d \n \u201c I suppose you \u2019 ll have to. \u201d \n \n He explained the thing to me as a biomechanical chamber, nearly self-sustaining\u2014the energy still had to come from an external source. A complex system of organic compounds and computers would surround and connect to my body, constantly monitoring my vital conditions and providing for me accordingly. I just needed to be hooked-in and my body would never, in any regard, experience surplus or deficit. I would be Aristotle \u2019 s perfect mean; the Buddha \u2019 s middle-way. I would be all the unity and balance of the universe in one desperate microcosm. \n \n I felt the rare sensation of air flowing across the back of my neck, torso, and legs as my body was lifted and transported to the machine that I hoped would be my grave. I was given no tombstone. I had, in fact, turned down countless requests for one from various corporations and religious organizations\u2014the difference between the representatives only ever discernable through title and attire. They offered me huge sums of money to have their messages preserved on the exterior of my biomechanical resting place. \n *Money. * Can you believe that? \n I told them to immolate the bills and piss-out the flames. I held no reverence for their paper deities when I had a use for them, and my forthcoming oblivion ushered in no resurgence of piety. \n \n Ultimately, it was decided that my tomb would bear only the name I \u2019 d chosen for it: *Moksha. * \n \n It was *odd* being present for my own funeral, and nothing felt odd after a century-and-a-half of conscious experience. The team of doctors and scientists who \u2019 d studied me and kept me alive ( or been the puppets of a universe that wanted me alive\u2014I am still unable to say which is more accurate ) stood together dressed in black suits. I \u2019 d only ever seen them in white coats. \n They had already made sure\u2014made *damn* sure\u2014that any data they could gather about me and my rare condition had been collected. Of course, they still had questions. \n \u201c How are you feeling? \u201d \n * \u201c So good I could die. \u201d * \n \u201c Do you think you \u2019 re ready? \u201d \n * \u201c To sit motionless for eternity? I \u2019 ve been practicing for decades. \u201d * \n \u201c Are you scared? \u201d \n * \u201c \u2026 \u201d * \n \u201c Are y- \u201d \n * \u201c Only that it won \u2019 t end. \u201d * \n \n Before they delivered me to *Moksha*, I was asked if I had any questions. There was only one, asked innumerable times but never answered. \n * \u201c Why is it only me that never dies? \u201d * \n One of the doctors sighed. \n \u201c I don \u2019 t know. This is your unique experience of whatever we mean by \u2018 life \u2019. \u201d \n Their drugs gently slipped my mind toward unconscious sleep. When I awoke, my thoughts echoed in the emptiest of voids. \n \n All I have now in *Moksha* is thought. This is my unique experience. Thoughts about thoughts about thoughts\u2026 They all seemed so meaningful and profound until they became all that I had. Now, I simply get lost in them, caught-up as if in a dream, only to be woken-up by a tangential thought that carries me to new ideas. Old thoughts fade like the wake from a ship. Where do they go? What a silly question\u2026 What a novel idea\u2026 \n Like the idea that got me here! Kill my identity. Ha! \u201c My \u201d \u2014as if there \u2019 s ownership to an idea\u2026 As if that metaphorical diamond I \u2019 d found was anything more than a semi-coherent reordering of words I \u2019 d heard from Alan Watts, Sartre, Nietzsche, Buddha, Jesus, Camus, Eckhart, Huxley, and those philosophy majors I got high with in college\u2026 We \u2019 re similar to diamonds, us self-aware beings\u2014we \u2019 re just structures of carbon that found ourselves in an environment with too much pressure to be left unchanged; too much pressure to not become something greater. A diamond may never be anything more than the carbon it formed from, but, my God, is it beautiful when enlivened by light.

With the human population surge of the last few centuries, space had become a huge premium, forcing Lucifer to relocate to the tiny annex. \n \n `` Hail Great One,'' crooned the imp, `` I beseech thy Dark Prince for...'' \n \n Lucifer waved the imp to silence without looking up. `` Please, Moby, just get on with it. I have 120,000 new intakes today.'' \n \n `` Oh, Moby is so saddened to hear that. But what of Dark Lord's servants?'' \n \n Lucifer raised his head. `` The work ethic of the new help is just abysmal. They expect healthcare and meal breaks. I'm like,'You're dead and you do n't eat, what the Hell?''' \n \n He sighed. `` This progressive human development is the *worst*, Moby. Billions of new souls to deal with, and most of them spoiled brats.'' \n \n Moby twisted his legs and pivoted, staring down like a schoolboy in trouble. \n \n `` Ah, Christ on a cracker. What is it, Moby?'' \n \n The imp glanced up. `` Moby is so sorry, Dark Prince. A Heavenly Decree has just been received. It appears that God has been experiencing similar population issues, and He has ordered an Eighth Deadly Sin be enforced.'' \n \n Lucifer's nostrils flared, and for a moment his despondence seemed to fade and he rose up in fury. `` What?! That holier-than-thou snake! Always passing the buck down to us!'' Momentarily, his shoulders slumped and he fell back into his chair. `` But what does it matter?'' he moaned. `` I'm bound by our eternal contract. Why did I sign that thing, anyway?'' \n \n `` If the Dark Lord permits, Moby has an idea.'' Lucifer motioned him to continue. `` God has put no limits on *what* the sin can be, my Prince. So, if you were to...'' \n \n Lucifer held up his hand, grinning ear to ear. `` Moby, you fiendishly brilliant fiend, remind me to double your torture-free days next month!''

A small and slender grey-haired man stepped cautiously through the flames. He wore a red button-down sweater, black tie, and had the most genuine smile Lucifer had seen in his millennia of torturous existence. \n \n `` Oh, my. It's an awfully hot day in this neighborhood,'' the man said with a nervous twitch. `` Hello, friends. Might I trouble you for some directions?

Just like in Cinderella , As soon as you touch the hand of `` the one '' you have an insatiable urge to kiss .\n","story":"Madelyn story \n \n Part 1 \n \n `` Aish! `` said Madelyn. A dog jumped at her while she was walking to her university. `` Ya, what is this? control that thing!'' she yelled at the stranger. She was already frustrated from the tons of studying she has to do to get ahead. She wants to be the top student in her class. `` Sorry, sorry'' said the stranger. Madelyn huffed and walked away. `` I can hardly breathe'' thought Madelyn. She was not used to the pollution Korea had and the yellow dust was high in this season. Suddenly, birds flew out of a bush at great speed toward her. They knocked off her glasses. `` OMG'' said Madelyn. Picking up her glasses, she discovered they were broken to her dismay. `` Why this of all things'' thought Madelyn. She could see blurry now. The people on the street were just moving blobs. To escape the rush hour of blobs, she turned to the nearest door and went inside. \n \n part 2 \n \n Inside she could make out a few things. She could see low-lighting tan seats. This new place also had a strange sweet smelling aroma in the air. Madelyn could hear chatter around the building. She could also see a sign with numbers on it attached to the wall. `` Eh, kinda like a menu'' thought Madelyn. She had a sudden realization. She was in a cafe. `` This is not the reality I wanted'' thought Madelyn. It was better than being outside in the yellow dust. She made her way in line. Maybe ordering coffee would soothe her nerves. ( Baby baby Gu de nun Caramel macchiato ) could be heard in the background of the cafe. `` Typical,'' said Madelyn. `` Waegukin,'' someone whispered. Madelyn was used to hearing that, but also found it unnecessary. Alright, It was her time to order. She ordered a caramel cappuccino. Grabbing a seat next to the window, Madelyn watched the korean rush hour wondering if it will ever slow down. She was finally feeling relaxed. `` Do you mind if I sit here?'' a stranger asked. Madelyn was in a better mood and she was feeling generous. `` Sure,'' said Madelyn. `` So, uh what's your name?'' said the stranger. All Madelyn could see was a blurry pale face with what it could seem a mask on it. She could barely make out his facial features. She could guess it is a `` he'' because of the deep husky voice. `` My name is Madelyn'' said Madelyn unenthusiastically. `` Well I do n't have any friends here so I might as well go with this,'' thought Madelyn.'' My name is Park Chanyeol, nice to meet you,'' he said reaching out a hand. Madelyn looked at him with a spark in her eye then said,'' An introduction without bowing?'' Chanyeol chuckled. `` Well, excuse me for being so informal.'' said Chanyeol. He stood up then said `` Allow me to re- introduce my self I am Park Chanyeol,'' Then he bowed 90 degrees. Madelyn laughed. `` I was n't serious ya know,'' said Madelyn. Chanyeol motioned to her for her to bow as well. Then Madelyn said `` My name is Madelyn'' then she bowed. They both laughed and shook hands. As soon as their hands made contact, there was a shock. It was like a static shock, but more aggressive. Chanyeol noticed they stood holding hands longer than they should have because he was looking in her eyes. Madelyn was the first to let go, feeling a little awkward. She was especially since some kids were looking at them like they were crazy. \n \n Part 3 \n \n Madelyn cleared her throat and sat down. A few kids and adults were staring at them and not just because Madelyn is a foreigner. The awkward handshakes are not really found in Korea. \u201c What are you doing here in Korea? \u201d Asked Chanyeol. Changing the subject was his specialty. \u201c I don \u2019 t know what are you doing here? \u201d Asked Madelyn. `` I asked you first \u201d said Chanyeol playfully. Madelyn she doesn \u2019 t usually give away information. This time she will make an exception. `` I am here studying computer science, \u201d said Madelyn. \u201c Wow, where are you studying? \u201d `` Kyung Hee university,'' said Madelyn. She was surprised at herself, not really knowing what came over her. \u201c Kyung Hee! \u201d said Chanyeol beaming. \u201c I used to go there, you can call me sunbaenim. Maybe even Oppa. \u201d \u201c Maybe not \u201d, said Madelyn bitterly. I studied Arts and Culture said Chanyeol boastingly \u201c I \u2019 m pretty much an expert in that so\u2026yeah, \u201d said Chanyeol while putting his hands behind his head. \u201c This kid, \u201d thought Madelyn. She couldn \u2019 t see it but she was sure that he was bragging. They talked liked that for quite some time. Madelyn turned to the clock, it was all blurry which didn \u2019 t help her tell the time. \u201c Aw, man my head hurts, \u201d said Madelyn. Probably because you haven \u2019 t worn you glasses. Said Chanyeol. \u201c How did you know I wear glasses? \u201d Asked Madelyn puzzled. \u201c Well it takes one to know one, \u201d Said Chanyeol bluntly. \u201c Plus, whenever you look at me your squinting very hard, \u201d said Chanyeol. Madelyn sank in her chair from embarrassment. Who knew she could be this obvious. \u201c The time is 7:00 pm, if you \u2019 re wondering, \u201d said Chanyeol chuckling. \n Madelyn shot up her seat. \u201c 7:00pm! Oh my gosh I \u2019 m going to be late! \u201d Said Madelyn. `` I don \u2019 t know if a blind bat can get to where she \u2019 s going on her own,'' said Chanyeol playfully. Madelyn furrowed her eyebrows. She knew where this is going. \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s hard walking to the university. \u201d Said Madelyn. `` It would be hard if someone didn \u2019 t know a secret shortcut,'' said Chanyeol persuasively. Madelyn didn \u2019 t have a choice, and she couldn \u2019 t afford to be late. \u201c Oh, if only you knew someone who knew the secret passage way, \u201d Said Chanyeol. He looked like he could burst from excitement in any moment. \u201c And who might know the secret passage way, \u201d said Madelyn. She couldn \u2019 t believe she was saying those words. \u201c Why I am I talking to him? \u201d Thought Madelyn. \u201c This was not part of the plan. Don \u2019 t let friends or distractions get in th- \u201c \u201c Come on! \u201d said Chanyeol cheerfully. He quickly stood up and grabbed her by the hand and ran out the door. I cold caramel cappuccino was left behind. \n \n part 4 \n \n They darted out the doors into the open world. People were swarming in the streets each of them knowing their destination. Chanyeol stopped and asked `` When do you need to be there?'' Caught of guard Madelyn replied,'' 7:45pm''. He smiled and said `` Are you ready?'' `` Ye-'' Fighting `` he said while running at top speed. They headed for the stairs leading to the subway. Practically tripping down the stairs, Chanyeol stopped so Madelyn could catch her breath. `` You ok,'' asked Chanyeol while looking down at her. `` Yeah, I'm fine,'' Madelyn has n't exercised in a while but she could manage to keep up. `` Were almost there,'' said Chanyeol. He was enjoying this to much. They zigzagged and zipped through the crowds of people. Now they were outside again this time way closer to the university. Chanyeol laughed and stopped at the corner of the crosswalk. `` Wow, it 7:30!'' said Madelyn shocked. `` Well, you can thank me later,'' said Chanyeol. Neither of them noticed the whole time they were on their `` trip'' their hands were locked and fingers intertwined. A spontaneous shock erupted from nowhere and went through their hands. Chanyeol looked down and noticed their hands. He blushed and let go. He took off his mask which is a habit of his when he is really embarrassed. `` Chanyeol?'' someone whispered. `` Chanyeol of Exo,'' someone else whispered. `` I got to go, maybe we could do this again sometime,'' said Chanyeol in a hurry as he sped walked away. `` Chanyeol of Exo?'' thought Madelyn. `` Oh my God, how could I not of noticed'' thought Madelyn. She then made her way to her class. \n `` I have been talking to a idol this whole time, how odd'' thought Madelyn. `` How many chanyeols are in Korea?'' Thought Madelyn. She sat and waited for her class to begin. `` I' ve should of known `` she thought to herself. \n \n Meanwhile \n \n Chanyeol was walking to his entertainment company. He had an upbeat walk while he was swinging his arms. He stopped to put his mask on to keep his disguise. A post not far from the university caught his eye. It had a list of new students from Kyung Hee. He found international students.He saw Madelyn in the list of top students. He smiled to himself. He was proud of his new friend. To the left there was a list of upcoming birthdays. `` Her birthday is this Sunday'' thought Chanyeol.'' I should give her a gift'' thought Chanyeol walking away. That shock was weird, I never felt anything like that before `` he thought. A stingly feeling inside his stomach keeps appearing when he thinks about her. Chanyeol made his way inside the entertainment building. Ayo, Chanyeol `` said Baekhyun. Chanyeol merely waved and sat down. This was not like him and everyone noticed. `` Are you ok'' said D.o. `` Never better'' Chanyeol said putting his hands behind his head.D.o raised an eyebrow. Chanyeol could n't contain it any longer. `` Ok you guys wo n't believe what happened to me, I met this girl, her name is Madelyn and I want- `` Slow down'' said Baekhyun. `` Just get to the point'' he said. `` Will you guys help me through a surprise birthday party for her'' asked Chanyeol. `` I do n't know,'' said D.o. `` Please???'' Pleaded Chanyeol. He also did some aegyo. `` Ok fine just stop that'' said Baekhyun. Thanks guys I'll make this up to you.'' Chanyeol exclaimed. He had the biggest grin on. He asked Xiumin to help. `` No way,'' he said crossing his arms.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people the devil honored contracts .\n","story":"Humanity, at it's core, is a race of optimists. To a human, there is always a way to win, no matter how impossible a challenge may seem. Across human mythos, there is one central rule that remains unchallenged: Humans will eventually win. \n \n It's a delusion that I've worked very hard to cultivate. \n \n See, no one thinks to question why an entity of pure evil would honor something as arbitrary as a promise. Perhaps, deep down inside, they do n't think to question it because it's inconvenient to them; after all, those who seek to deal with ME are n't often in a position to negotiate. \n \n Believe it or not, it was much harder to trick people out of their souls in the old days. Back then, people were dominated by fear, and would fetch their crosses at the first sign of me. The few that DID succumb to my wiles were quickly snuffed out, making it very hard for me to get things done. \n \n Eventually, I figured out the problem: People were too afraid of me to make a deal. They KNEW what would happen if they consorted with my kind, and that it would surely lead to their downfall. So what could I do convince them that they had a fighting chance against little old me? \n \n Let a couple of them win, and live to tell the tale. \n \n To this day, my personal favorite of these tales involved a little Georgia boy named Johnny. The squirt could play a mean fiddle, sure, but I could have summoned an unholy orchestra of violinists more talented than him. But I let him have his little victory, and his little golden fiddle- so long as he told all his friends that Ol' Scratch played fair and square. \n \n Soon, I had people lining up to take a crack at me, challenging me to cards and pool games and whatnot. I still let them win, occasionally; after all, for every 1 that I let get away, there's 100 that do n't get so lucky. And sometimes, I even get the one that got away, albeit a little bit later. \n \n Take little Johnny, for example: After 20 years bragging that he beat Lucifer in a fiddling contest, the kid had n't an ounce of humility in him. Vanity, of course, is my domain; so when one of Johnny's drinking buddies got sick of hearing `` the one where I beat Ol' Scratch'', I was waiting for him with open arms. And as Johnny's soul made its way down to me, I could n't help but laugh when I saw him realize that he was damned the moment he shook my hand.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] It 's New Years Eve . Your best friend died in September , you 've been robbed twice , your girl friend is leaving you , you 've just lost your job and the only one left to talk to is a gay burglar you 've got tied up in the kitchen . P.S . Your cat is dead .\n","story":"`` You want some coffee or something?'' \n \n I turned and stared blankly at the gay burglar restrained uncomfortably on the kitchen floor of my shithole apartment, a small trickle of blood creeping down from his gay hairline onto the bridge of his gay nose. He did n't *look* gay, but then again I do n't know how somebody *would* look gay in all black sweats and a skull cap. I found myself idly wondering if he dressed... I do n't know, gayer, I guess, when he was n't out burglarizing shitty apartments on New Year's Eve. \n \n I mean that in the literal sense, by the way. The man was flaming. He had been on the phone out in the hallway with somebody shortly before I conked him over the head with a skillet in my living room. He had that weird lisp that some of them seem to like using. Took a couple swings to get him to the floor. He had a lot of foul things to say, too, in between meetings of cast iron and gay skull that is. I'd never met a straight guy who spoke like that so I figured it was safe to assume that he was pitching for the other team. I do n't just call everything I do n't like'gay' like I'm some kind of eighth grader in the late nineties. Which is n't to say I did n't like him - he seemed nice enough for a burglar - it's just he was rummaging through the box of old stuff that Seth had left for me before he ate a shotgun shell last September, and *I* had n't even looked into that box yet for fear of what emotional pain I might find in there, and it was pretty upsetting to see a complete stranger, who never even *met* him, putting his stupid little fingers all over... You get the point. Moving on. \n \n `` Ah, right. Do n't suppose you'd be able to drink it from down there.'' Plus his mouth was Gorilla Taped shut so I guess I'm not even really sure why I asked. I stared blankly at him for a moment, unsure of what else to say. It suddenly occurred to me that this was the sort of thing people were talking about when they mentioned `` a pregnant pause''. Or maybe not. Whatever. He looked terrified. I felt bored. I had just been robbed the week before. Caught that one, too, although I'd been more afraid at the time and called 911 while hiding in the bedroom closet. The second time around felt more like a mild annoyance than anything, really. I'd been having trouble feeling much of anything recently. \n \n I turned back to the leaky piece of Dollar Store shit that passed for a coffee maker around my place, absentmindedly spooning grounds into the filter basket and mashing a pudgy finger into the cheap'ON' button. The LED did n't light up. Probably broken like everything else in my life. The rest of the coffee maker seemed to be functioning well enough, though, which was lucky. It was probably going to be a long night and I did n't feel much like sleeping anyway. The bed I used to share with Jocelyn was even less appealing than the couch I found Daisy dead on, and so I had resigned myself to a small recliner near the window until I either stopped feeling weird about the rest of my shitty furniture or else just burned the whole miserable goddamn building to the ground. Whichever came first. \n \n Jesus Christ, what a fucking horrible bitch. Who confesses an affair to their boyfriend of 4 years, the same day his cat dies, and then just leaves immediately? I barely even had time to respond. She was already packed up and ready to go by the time I got home from another day of fruitless job hunting and dodging phone calls from debt collectors. The combined weight of the last few weeks had piled up high enough to snap something in my psyche. I simply did not fucking care anymore. About anything, really. I had felt nothing at all lately except for a dull, bored sort of a misery. Fucking Jocelyn. An image of her curled up and smiling by a nice fireplace somewhere with Steve flashed through my mind's eye. Fucking Steve. \n \n The coffee loudly sputtered and then fell silent. I found myself staring at the burglar. It suddenly occurred to me that I'd probably just been standing there staring at him for an entire brew cycle. His eyes were frantically darting around the room like they had fucking motors attached to them and he was starting to sweat pretty profusely. Poor dumb bastard probably thought I was gon na kill him or something. I still had n't bothered calling the police. I turned away and poured some coffee into a chipped and stained old mug, wondering what I should do with him. There'd been a whole mess of statements and paperwork when this happened last week and I was feeling far too apathetic to do all of that again. To be honest, I did n't really care if the guy got arrested or not. He looked to be on the verge of shitting himself and probably had a fuck of a headache from that skillet so I doubted he'd be coming back any time soon. I walked purposefully over to his tense, sweaty body and ripped the tape off his mouth. \n \n `` PLEASEPLEASEIMSORRYILLGOILLNEVERCOMEBACKILL-'' \n \n `` Oh for fuck's sake, shut up,'' I said, suddenly regretting taking the tape off. `` I'm not going to hurt you. What's your name?'' \n \n ``... Steve.'' \n \n Fucking Steve. Had to be a fucking Steve. I sighed and pressed the tape back over his mouth. If he'd had any name other than *fucking Steve*, I probably would've felt bad about using the Gorilla tape instead of normal duct tape. That was powerful stuff. Probably hurt like a bitch coming off. Luckily the guy did n't have a mustache. Or at least I did n't think he did. I ripped the tape off a second time and inspected his upper lip. No mustache. No mustache on the tape either. Pressing the strip of black tape back over his mouth, I reached around and patted his pockets, not quite sure what I was looking for but not sure what else to do either. Back right pocket, large square lump. A brief half-smile snuck it's way across my face at the thought of a burglar being dumb enough to bring his own goddamned wallet with him on a burglary. Probably had his real ID in there and everything. \n \n `` You know, you're not very good at this burglary stuff, Steven.'' I said without looking at him. `` Can I call you Steven? I'm not a big fan of'Steve', personally.'' \n \n He nodded violently as I rifled through his wallet, removing his state ID and a small stack of twenties and tens. \n \n `` Steven Schubert, 1026 Peregrine Lane. Blue eyes, blond hair...'' I trailed off as I flipped it over to read the back. ``... Organ donor! Nice of you, Steven. My father's on the waiting list for a liver, you know. Or I assume he still is, anyway. Have n't heard from him in a few years now. The guy's a dick. Too bad you ca n't specify'but not for alcoholic shitbirds' when you consent to the whole donor thing, huh?'' \n \n I stared intently at some indistinct spot on the old linoleum floor for a moment, remembering my father's dickery. I had n't thought about him in months. Fucking dad. \n \n Oh right, burglar thing, forgot for a second. \n \n `` Here's the deal, Steven'' I said calmly. `` I am having an absolute *fuck* of a bad week and if I have to spend half my night talking to a bunch of cops and writing boring statements again, I swear I'll snap. And to be honest, I just really do n't give a shit. Sorry about the skillet. I was upset. I'm sure you have a concussion. Definitely gon na wan na stay awake for tonight, and go to the hospital if you start to feel sick or anything, ok?'' \n \n He nodded violently again. He seemed to relax a bit, though he was still sweating bullets. Kind of making a mess of my shitty floor, frankly. I walked over to the counter and removed a small paring knife from where it sat in the block. \n \n `` I'm going to cut you loose, and you're going to go home, got it?'' \n \n More violent nodding. \n \n `` I'm keeping the cash from your wallet. Sorry. Looks like enough to cover Jocelyn's half of the rent this month and I could really use it.'' \n \n I squatted down beside him, cutting his ankles and wrists free of the tape and he scrambled for the door, mouth still taped shut. I was n't gon na remove the mouth tape anyway - Gorilla tape is tough shit and I actually did feel a little bad for ripping it off twice already. Not to mention the whole skillet thing. He could do it himself now that his hands were free. \n \n Mildly amazed at how numb I still felt, I went to the living room and sat quietly in the recliner as scattered fireworks began to pop off outside. *Must be midnight*, I thought. \n \n Fucking New Year's. \n \n *edited for typos and some other dumb mistakes \n \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ IP ] Sight beyond sight\n","story":"Jagen \u2019 s fingers had started to go numb by the time Tazimi finished unraveling the spells of protection over the darkened window. His foot ached where it was wedged into a little nook he \u2019 d found in the wall \u2019 s sheer face, his legs burned from crouching against the brickwork, and he was trying not to think about how nice a pint at the pub around the corner would taste when the telltale tickle of sorcery made him sneeze. He stifled it as best he could against his shoulder, but he could feel Tazimi \u2019 s glower from below as he wiped his nose on his hood. \n \n \u201c There! \u201d She hissed up at him, magically throwing her voice so it whispered against his ear. \u201c Your time to shine, you noisy idiot. \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s safe? \u201d He murmured back, ignoring her jibe as he adjusted his grip on the drainpipe. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the small woman put her hands on her hips. If it \u2019 d been safe to make more noise, he was sure she \u2019 d have tapped her foot. The hood thrown over her dark head didn \u2019 t conceal her scowl. \n \n \u201c Yes, it \u2019 s safe. \u201d She sounded annoyed, which wasn \u2019 t unusual. \u201c Now go! \u201d \n \n Jagen wedged his foot further into the nook. His knuckles popped, joints protesting at the sudden movement after more than twenty minutes held stiff. \n \n The latch locking the window was cold, colder than it ought to have been in the warmth of the dying summer. Even after all these years above ground, seasons were still a novelty to Jagen. He \u2019 d grown up a Subber, one of the street kids of subterranean Bal Urzod, the Diamond Under The Mountain, where the air was always pleasant, cool, and damp. The hot, dry air here in Abria hadn \u2019 t warmed the iron of the window latch, and Jagen looked back down to Tazimi, confused. \n \n \u201c The lock is cold. Are you sure- \u201d \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s fine, Jag! The wizard probably just has a cold-stone set on the windowsill inside. \u201d She flicked her head to each side, looking up and down the alley. \u201c Get going before some drunkard comes by for a piss! \u201d \n \n With a sigh, Jag pulled the lockpicks from his belt and set to work, gripping the drainpipe with his thighs and settling his weight into the foot-nook. After a brief struggle, Jagen proved victorious and the lock snicked open. Using the tip of the pick as a lever, he separated the two sides of the window just the breadth of the pick. Candlelight poured from the crack, in stark contrast to the unlit panes of glass. No alarms sounded, no change in pressure or tickling in his nostrils indicated magic, and no flaming destruction rained down on him, but Jagen \u2019 s heart sped into his throat and he whipped his gaze down to Tazimi. \n \n She \u2019 d stilled, half in and half out of the blanketing shadows of the alley. \n \n \u201c What do I do? \u201d Jagen asked. \n \n \u201c Can you see anyone? \u201d \n \n Silently, Jagen peered through the crack he \u2019 d made, then recoiled, almost losing his footing. A hooded figure sat, still as a stone, before a wide wooden desk. Candles littered the floor, the walls, the bookshelves, the very air itself - they floated unsupported around the figure \u2019 s head, casting flickering light throughout the room. Fear spiked through him, and, not daring to speak, he nodded his head. \n \n Tazimi \u2019 s voice was tight, worried. \u201c The wizard? \u201d \n \n He nodded again, harder. \n \n \u201c What \u2019 s he doing? \u201d \n \n Shocked, Jagen looked back to his partner. \u201c You want me to go in and ask him? \u201d He asked in a tiny whisper, his shuddering breath catching. \u201c I \u2019 m coming down. \u201d \n \n \u201c No! \u201d Tazimi \u2019 s tone had changed. She was stern now, all business. \u201c We blow this job and we \u2019 re fucked. Abria is the best we can get outside of Kerra Ghen and you know we can \u2019 t go back to the capital if we want to live. \u201d She lifted a hand to her mouth, probably to chew on a fingernail like she always did when she was nervous. Then she dropped it, as if realizing what she \u2019 d done and wanting to cover the anxious gesture up with decisive action. \u201c Stay still. I \u2019 ll be right there. \u201d \n \n \u201c What? \u201d He \u2019 d only just gotten the word out before he sneezed again. The tattoos on Tazimi \u2019 s fingers and wrists glowed a soft, warm gold that cast no illumination into the shadows around her. She hooked and crooked her fingers, moving her hands to encompass something in the air before her, then she lifted her knee and set her foot on the now solid air. She stamped on it, checking to see if it would hold, then ran up what seemed to Jagen to be an invisible set of stairs until she stood at his side. \n \n \u201c Why couldn \u2019 t you have just done that for- \u201d \n \n The rest of his sentence was muffled by Tazimi \u2019 s palm pressed tight to his lips. Her eyebrows dropped as she glared at him and raised a single finger, ringed at regular intervals with narrow black bands of ink, to her firmly closed lips. Jagen rolled his eyes and nodded, his fear lessening now that she was nearer. The two of them had gotten out of worse scrapes than this before. Jagen would happily put coin down to say they \u2019 d get out of worse in the future, too. She released him and moved so she could look through the opening in the window. \n \n After a moment \u2019 s scrutiny, Tazimi whispered a few low syllables under her breath, then blew out a stream of air through the crack. Jagen almost did n't feel the tickle this time - a tiny spell, made to be almost undetectable. Someone without the Touch wouldn \u2019 t notice it, though he doubted it would fool the Wizard from whom they \u2019 d come to steal. He clenched his teeth and reached out for Taz, ready to fling her onto his back and slide down the drainpipe at the smallest sound of alarm. The skin on his palms burned in anticipation of the scrapes he was sure were imminent. \n \n No alarm came. Tazimi stayed poised at the window, chest still, not breathing. Jagen edged a foot towards her and found that he too could stand on the solid patch of air. She was intently focused on the room inside the window, and his arms, for all their muscle, throbbed like anything. He released his hold on the drainpipe and pushed off to land beside the sorceress. She ignored him. \n \n Jagen \u2019 s imagination flashed, running wild, thinking of what this would look like if Tazimi had been right, and a drunkard stumbled into the alley to relieve himself of the ale he \u2019 d imbibed in the pub. A slim man all in grays and greens and a short woman dressed for travel along the Road, standing suspended at a well known Wizard \u2019 s window. They \u2019 d have the advantage of the higher ground in a fight, he supposed, before correcting himself. The higher air. His stomach lurched and he looked straight up, avoiding sight of the ground. \n \n Tazimi straightened up and touched his hand. He glanced down and regretted it. As she spoke, he turned his eyes skyward again. *What a time to gain a fear of heights, * he chided himself in his head. \n \n \u201c He \u2019 s in a trance, I think. He didn \u2019 t notice my probe and he hasn \u2019 t moved at all - not even to breathe. \u201d Jagen felt her shift and would have bet she was chewing on that same fingernail from before. \u201c I think, \u201d she whispered, speaking around something in her mouth. \u201c I think we can go through with the job. \u201d \n \n \u201c Okay\u2026 \u201d Jagen drew out the word, buying time. \u201c How long will he stay in the trance? \u201d \n \n \u201c No way of knowing, but it \u2019 s only one book, right? We can nip in- \u201d \n \n Jagen dropped his gaze to her face and tried hard to focus only on her wide brown eyes, the sprinkling of freckles over her nose - a souvenir from her topside upbringing and their time along the Road. The total absence of anything beneath her still made him want to throw up, but he suppressed the urge. \u201c We? \u201d He snapped, attempting to sound like he wasn \u2019 t about to vomit. \u201c No, Taz. Me. \u201d He curled his still-pale fingers around her brown ones as she shifted to move away. \u201c I nip in. You stay out here and down there. \u201d He pointed to the ground he wished he was on. \n \n Tazimi shook her head. \u201c No. We go in together. That way, I can buy us some time if he wakes. He \u2019 ll leave you a smoking pile of plasm if I \u2019 m not there. \u201d \n \n Jagen gulped. \u201c Can we not talk about that like it \u2019 s going to happen, please? \u201d \n \n She smiled an uncharacteristically optimistic smile, slipped out of his grip, and whispered, \u201c It won \u2019 t! \u201d \n \n He didn \u2019 t believe her, but when she pushed the windows open wide, he followed her just like he always did. \n \n **PART 2 IS BELOW**\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] You were born with a large birthmark in the shape of a dragon . However , this is just a coincidence ; there is absolutely nothing magical about it , and you 're getting really tired of explaining this .\n","story":"I. \n \n Though the Spirits are unified by their ability to manipulate sleeping minds, many of them had chosen to abandon the \u201c Old Ways \u201d of the Elders. The Elders are deceptive by nature. Consuming a man \u2019 s soul through his dreams did not appeal to the pacifists among them. No, instead, the Exorcised dwelt among the still living, condemned by those with greater powers for disowning what was once theirs to share. \n \n \n Mistaken for dreams of fantasy and legend, Spirits begin their weaving of magic and manipulation through appearing as mythical beasts. Elders, as self-proclaimed gods, identify as dragons. No other Spirit may do so, of course. This would be unheard of. As the Elders teemed in the hours of dusk, their Exorcised counterparts lay in stasis. There powers were gone but not forgotten, for they could not be tormented by the Elders as the humans were. \n \n \n Exorcised, during the day, can be any sort of living thing. Lesser Spirits became houseplants, others like trees in a forest. Greater Spirits typically take the form of a domesticated animal, like a cat or dog; depending on their personality, of course. No supreme Spirit controls the outcome of an Exorcised. It is as simple as a coin flip, whether or not one is considered to be great. How each Exorcised chooses to live \u2013 that is, morally \u2013 once they \u2019 ve abandoned their powers, is entirely up to them. They may exercise their exorcism, if you will. \n \n \n Most Exorcised choose to live as guardians for the living. To become Exorcised, a Spirit first endures the pain of a Torment; the nightly affliction of an Elder upon a sleeping being. This suffering occurs in a concentrated, short dosage. Imagine the sting of an insect, directly to the temple. Now inject that insect with a toxin so subtle that you only know it \u2019 s there because I \u2019 ve told you so. Its toxicity climbs quickly, escalating as though you were running up one instead of waiting to the side with the others. At its peak, your mind shuts down. \n \n \n And this is the deepest sense of pain. \n \n \n This occurs only while one sleeps. When dusk arrives, it brings with it an unknown sense of calm. Elders feed on this peace, knowing that the human has become unsettled. Lies become truth, and the self can no longer be trusted. And the cycle begins. \n \n \n Through this slightly altered process, these Spirits emerge as Exorcised. In first hearing the stories of the Old Ways inflicted upon man, compassion and empathy arose within a select few. Less than half of them, to be sure. \n \n \n Elders understand the decisions of the Exorcised. They jest at their fallen comrades, as if to believe that there ever was a war to begin with. This rage stems from within Spirits. The majority, a little more than half of them, insist that it is a defining characteristic to cultivate over eons and eternities. To be an Elder is to be deceit. To be an Exorcised is to betray. \n \n Now, it should be said that there is indeed power left within the Exorcised. But it is no longer theirs to keep. Whether lesser or greater, these titles defining only the Spirits \u2019 form and ability, each Exorcised subtly uplifts the humans around them. \n \n \n A divine aroma from a rose. The unburdened loyalty of an animal. These are the Exorcised. \n \n \n -- - \n \n II. \n \n Each man and woman is marked with a creature, in the form of a tattoo, at birth. These are visible on the inner sides of the dominant hand \u2019 s fingers, and are often kept hidden; out of shame, of course. Particular markings on particular people are said to be curses, for those with more intricate tattoos tend to suffer more greatly than those with seemingly invisible ones. \n \n Artists, the Spirits with no affiliation to Elders or Exorcised, are assigned with creating these markings. This too is decided by a coin flip. \n \n No choices are made prior to the actions of an Elder \u2019 s first Torment or an Exorcised \u2019 s sole banishment. It is once these processes have begun that the human becomes aware of the existence of Spirits. \n \n Exorcised help and Elders hurt. \n \n And so it will always be. \n \n -- - \n III. \n \n You were born with a larger than average birthmark, extending past the inner workings of your fingers and reaching over and around the knuckles on both hands. These form a dragon. Its face seems old and bitter to you. \n \n It must be just a coincidence. \n \n There is absolutely nothing magical about it. \n \n You \u2019 re getting tired of explaining this to yourself. \n \n\n"}

But we had long forgotten the nature of human relationships. One of the many things we had to sacrifice to escape oblivion. \n `` Oh child...'' we adjusted the rimless spectacles attached to the visage of the false form, not an accessory but just an inorganic extension of the ghoulish illusion of what was once a man, nothing but sewed up bits of dead, cancerous flesh and steel wire, given the vigor of life through our majesty. We comforted the snack with what... what was it? A... `` laugh''? \n \n `` Child... I am not Steve Jobs.'' \n \n And then I showed him our true form.\n"}

We were leaving the streetlights and the bitter wind, exchanging it for the metallic aroma of machinery and copper. My nostrils filled with the smell of spoons, but I reached into my pocket for the flashlight. \n \n After several clicks and grunts, beams of light pierced the darkness. The window shut behind us, cutting off the chilling breeze, and I surveyed the hall. This was the left wing of the facility. \n \n My light ran over the blinking bulbous eyes of a camera. Nothing would be registered; we had fourteen minutes before the loop would be caught. Fourteen minutes to steal the egg of the President. \n \n \u201c Safeties off. \u201d Jake \u2019 s voice crackled in my ear. He was down the hall already, positioned by the steel door with a rifle across his front. Sylvia was bent down, pouring her fingers into a laptop. \n \n The rest of us scrambled into place.

Classified and stacked to incubate on a schedule predestined by the facility. \n \n We split into three groups. Shelf after shelf with glass faces loomed and zoomed past as we ran up the stairs and headed for the back. There were three paths for us to take, and we had to make sure all possible routes were clear. I could picture us as dots running along the blue prints we \u2019 d chalked up; everything was going according to plan. \n \n Up ahead I could see the soft red glow above an enormous steel circle that hung to the wall like a steering wheel. This was it; this was where the egg undoubtedly was. With this, we would hold the future of the country, the future of the world. \n \n I slowed down, allowing my two team mates to step ahead. My gun swiveled in my hands, my finger pulling the trigger twice. Two bursts of light, and they sunk to the ground without a word or a scream. Six to go. \n \n Sylvia, Jake, and one more whose name I didn \u2019 t know were already there as I slipped behind a shelf. Jake held the wheel with both hands, looking to Sylvia who held the laptop with one hand as she furiously typed with the other. The third man stood at guard, surveying the direction the other two teams should be coming from. \n \n \u201c Report in. \u201d Jake \u2019 s voice crackled in my ear, tense and sharp. \n \n Silence.

No. I'm not mad,'' I replied. `` I'm just... I'm overwhelmed.'' \n \n I thought back to all the times we had spent playing together. The nights we had spent cuddling under the warm blanket on the upstairs couch. I could remember so many of the meals I had made for her and how much we enjoyed each other's company. I had always known that our bond was special, but now this. And this was just... it was something else. \n \n `` It's bothering you, I can tell,'' she said to me softly. `` You've got the far-away look on your face, the one you always affect when you want to pretend like something is n't bothering you.'' \n \n `` It's not that.'' \n \n `` But it is. You can not lie to me. You need to understand that. Voxangelikus, this wo n't change things between us.'' \n \n That was a laugh. How could something this big not completely and permanently alter the entire foundation of our relationship? It would be like waking up and finding out that the blue sky above you for all of these years was actually neon pink. Even though you'd eventually get used to it you'd still always think of the sky as blue, not hot pink. \n \n `` Things are already changed,'' I said. `` You know they are.'' \n \n `` No,'' she purred, trying to pull herself against me. I pulled away and could sense her disappointment. She sighed heavily. `` Yes. Things are changed. But it does n't have to be bad, you know. We can still make things work out. It can maybe even be better than before.'' \n \n Maybe she was right. Maybe things could work out in the end. They would always be a little weird or difficult, but then again, our entire relationship had always had an element of strangeness to it, so it was n't that far-fetched to think this might work out somehow. I put my hand on her head and rubbed behind her neck. I scratched her behind the ears and rubbed her on the butt. Her back arched up and she purred heartily and said, `` That feels so nice!'' \n \n I sighed and started to think about the many options before us. It would require some heavy thought and some discussion with her, but maybe there was some way to make all of this work out just right.

However, it was the first time that the invaders had been so miserably unprepared. \n \n They'd come down in primitive cosmic contraptions which might as well have been boxes of steel with an engine attached to them. The first quarter of their strikeforce was left thoroughly confused as it did n't seem to be able to make it past our invisible force field. They were n't familiar with the concept. \n \n As the next hoard arrived, we did them the favour of disabling the force field simply to save them the humiliation of dying in the colds of space. The parents sent their kids out with toy guns to go have fun killing the creatures which arrived from the sky. Unfortunately they arrived as debris, flames, as ashes because of our planet's atmosphere. It was a disappointing day to say the least. \n \n Two months passed and for some reason, the humans, fully committed to their original plan came back, having decided losing half their squad was n't enough. Their boxes seemed to have some extra layers of wrapping around them now. \n \n We welcomed them with open arms, hoping this time that they'd make it to the surface. And they did. Well, some of them. Maybe 500 out of 10000. \n \n Our children launched punches at each other trying to get to the sacred 500 first. Maybe that had been their plan all along, to make us turn against ourselves. \n \n Nah. They were stupid. \n \n There were scenes all around the area where the humans had landed. Some quickly bagged one up for themselves to see how they were with a bit of seasoning and marinate in them. Extremely bitter, it turned out, with a tinge of saltiness.

She gave her a quick, awkward nod, before hurrying out of the office after her supervisor. \n \n \n \u201c Uhm, \u201d she said, trotting in an attempt to keep up with Agent Johnson \u2019 s angry strides, \u201c What exactly is Department 12? \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Hell, \u201d he grumbled, as stabbed the lift button with his finger. \n \n \n \u201c Uhm, \u201d \n \n \n Johnson glanced down at the confused face of his young colleague.

There were the typical desks and chairs, but the room at the end of the hall seemed more like a sitting room than an office. In its centre was a large, wooden table, surrounded by several chairs that looked too comfortable to fit in a department budget. The table was covered with books, paper, and what looked like the remains of a plate of biscuits. Around it sat three men. \n \n \n \u201c Alright, \u201d said Johnson in the tense manner one approaches a wild animal, \u201c I \u2019 m here for your report. \u201d \n \n \n The men looked up at him, their faces lighting up at being asked to present their findings. Johnson frowned. \n \n \n \u201c Well, as I \u2019 m sure you know, \u201d began the man with the black glasses, \u201c We \u2019 ve been analyzing the *Dragonman* movie. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Oooh, \u201d said MacKenna, \u201c I \u2019 ve been looking forward to that- sorry, \u201d she added hastily, noticing Johnson \u2019 s disapproving glare. \n \n \n The man in the black glasses smiled warmly at her. \n \n \n \u201c So, as I \u2019 m sure you know, the movie begins with Dragonman losing his job. He \u2019 s down and out, finds lost, and finds himself on the streets in a state of abject misery. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Which, \u201d said the man with the moustache, \u201c Is clearly an analogy for pre-Revolutionary society. \u201d \n \n \n The corner of Johnson \u2019 s lip twitched. \n \n \n \u201c Now, *Dragonman* \u2019 s recurring motif is, obviously, the dragon. What does a dragon symbolize? Well, if we look at representations of dragons throughout human culture and history, we see a traditional association with power and authority. The dragon as symbol, then, represents authority in its varied forms \u2013 authority over the self, authority over the state, a- \u201c \n \n \n \u201c Please, \u201d growled Johnson. \u201c Skip ahead to the relevant bits. \n \n \n Looking offended, the man with the moustache continued. \u201c If we take Dragonman \u2019 s own initial despair as a historical analogy, this first change \u2013 disruption to his norm \u2013 is clearly analogical to the period of turmoil we experienced during the Revolution. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c And, \u201d the man with the green eyes added, \u201c Dragonman \u2019 s discovery of his dragon powers is a clear representation of the new Republic \u2019 s acquisition of power. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Which he uses to help people. So it \u2019 s positive, \u201d said Johnson. \n \n \n \u201c Ah, \u201d said the man with the black glasses, \u201c Is it? You \u2019 re only looking at one layer. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c What. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c You see, \u201d he said, \u201c While on the surface, Dragonman overcoming his hardships may seem like a story representing progress and a development of his character, we can take the movie in a different light \u2013 as a satirical deconstruction of the *Dragonman* narrative. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c What the fuck are you talking about. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c We take for granted that Dragonman is the hero of his own story. If we, however, stop and analyse the movie, we see that it offers a different perspective- that Dragonman is as much the villain of *Dragonman* as X \u2019 thalr. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c But, \u201d said MacKenna, \u201c Isn \u2019 t X \u2019 thalr obviously evil? \u2026 sorry. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c See, \u201d said the man in the black glasses, his eyes glistening, \u201c These are the very assumptions the movie subverts. We, as viewers, assume a binary morality in its two central characters \u2013 an ethical dichotomy, if you will. X \u2019 thalr, while being the antagonist, is not evil. \u201d \n \n \n \u201c So it \u2019 s bad, \u201d growled Johnson. \n \n \n \u201c No, \u201d snapped the man with the moustache. \u201c That \u2019 s too simplistic. See, if we analyse the depictions of X \u2019 thalr, what stands out about him? \u201d \n \n \n Johnson stared blankly. \n \n \n \u201c He \u2019 s always framed in proximity to light. Whereas Dragonman\u2026 \u201d \n \n \n \u201c Is usually in the shadows, \u201d gasped MacKenna. \n \n \n \u201c Correct. And- \u201c \n \n \n \u201c So what is your fucking conclusion? \u201d snapped Johnson. \n \n \n \u201c Agent Johnson, \u201d said the man with the black glasses, visibly annoyed, \u201c That \u2019 s really quite rude of you. We haven \u2019 t even begin to talk about the use of colour, let alone the role of the third act- \u201c \n \n \n \u201c For, \u201d snarled Johnson, rubbing his forehead with a finger and thumb, \u201c The love of *fucking* God, would you please just fucking tell me what your conclusion is? \u201d \n \n \n The three men fell silent, before one finally spoke. \n \n \n \u201c It \u2019 s a good movie, complex, lots of hidden meaning \u2013 can \u2019 t really say anything for certain. \u201d \n \n \n - \n \n \n \u201c I don \u2019 t know, \u201d said MacKenna as Johnson stormed down the corridor, \u201c They seemed nice. \u201d \n \n \n - \n \n \n Several months later, Agent Johnson received a DVD of the new Dragonman movie as a present from a friend. \n \n \n He broke it in half. \n\n"}

Her body covered in bite marks. \n But Harrison was here in this room, and he knew who he'd been chasing for three years, his white whale, had been here, without the smell of metal in the air. There was no blood here, for there was no victim. There was no victim because this was the killer's home, where he lived, and planned and plotted and prepared his sickening, haunting acts, acts that have stayed with Harrison for over three years, three years of horror and hurt and turmoil which cost Harrison his job. \n \n So here was Harrison.

He was excited, giddy almost, maybe even slightly euphoric that he, and he alone, had found this place. A dank, dirty hovel, poorly lit, photos of his victims on the wall. All young girls with chunks of flesh missing. The only furniture was a fridge which Harrison dare n't look in. And a table, upon which sat a phone. An old fashioned rotary phone. And as soon as Harrison noticed it, it began to ring. \n \n Harrison held the receiver to his ear, but did n't speak. \n `` Is that Harrison?''

And you're keeping yourself on the line.'' \n \n `` Oh you are indeed running a trace are you? Tell me about it. And tell me about this'we' you so keenly refer to.'' Harrison tensed his back, an involuntary reflex everytime he was caught in a lie. The voice was relentless and carried on. `` You and your friends at the department are tracing this call? But wait that cant be right, you were disgraced and fired last year. Yes, that's right.'' The voice mused, playing with Harrison. \n Harrison's throat closed. \n \n `` You know, I've been waiting for this bitch to turn up for a couple of hours now, and male meat is n't really my taste, but seeing as some kindly walked itself into my home, I might just come home...

Then a voice floated out of the hallway to his right: `` Yeah.'' Another pause. `` This guy was comfortable, whoever he was.'' \n \n Charles passed his flashlight over a series of oil paintings that hung on the walls. A series of proud men, staring, stone-faced, out of their frames. Old money, then. Charles read the gold plaques beneath each painting. `` Kenneth Wayne. Patrick Wayne. Thomas Wayne... you ever heard of these guys?'' \n \n `` Nah,'' Vic called back. `` Hey there's a kitchen down here. I'm going to see if there's any food. I'll be on the radio.'' \n \n `` Wayne...'' Charles whispered. `` I swear I know that name from somewhere.'' \n \n The sound of Charles's boots on the marble floors echoed through the silent mansion. The place really was massive. Vic was right, whoever used to live here was rich. Beyond rich. The mansion looked large from the outside, a stern gargoyle crouching on the hill overlooking what remained of Gotham City. But once inside, the place was simply cavernous. Every sound echoed eerily, lasting a few seconds too long. Each room and hallway seemed to have been designed by Michelangelo for the use of giants. Compared to the burnt out hovels that Charles and Vic had been sleeping in over the past few months, the place was heaven. \n \n But that did n't stop the hairs on the back of Charles's neck from standing up. \n \n The radio on his belt crackled. `` How does it look in there, guys?''

The area was largely unadorned, a round wooden table with a jade vase the only decoration in the small atrium. On the far wall hung another oil painting, this one larger than the others.

Everything in the mansion -- the paintings, the floors, the vase -- was *clean. * `` This vase,'' Charles stammered. `` It's clean. There's no dust on it. Someone's been cleaning it.'' \n \n Vic's voice crackled over the radio, sounding as panicked as Charles felt. `` Shit. We're getting out of here. Maggie, keep your eyes peeled.

It was like they were deciding if shooting it because of what they felt from it, or not, I know most of us now wish they had shot it and made it as dead as it could be. The Child opened the tome and handed it to the president. A look of horror and curiosity crossed the president \u2019 s face, and he read silently, mouthing some of the words. Off to the side, in the side window that showed the sign language translator their face went pale as they were obviously reading the presidents lips. I had turned off my TV just after that point when the signer tried to kill herself on live TV. I didn \u2019 t know it then, but that was the end of the current war. \n We had been in a three way war, The middle east was both allied and against everyone else, doing suicide bombings of opportunity while everyone else attentions were elsewhere. The Western societies, European Union and North American federation along with their ally Japan were focused on the new Chinese People \u2019 s Republic, and the rebirth of Soviet Union. The Reformed Soviet Union reforming had been a massive blow to western society. What the spies figured out was the leaders of the Soviet Union had faked their fall to destabilize the United States of America, with seeded agent planting socialistic ideas and pushing for social instability by pushing an us versus them mentality inside the country. As America began to falter Russia started her reunification push. There was token resistance and sanctions from the west. These sanctions did more to hurt the western society because the Russians had been slowly making themselves more reliant on supplies only with in their own boarders. \n The war was started by the American leaders. In a last ditch attempt to stabilize after the Middle-East and the new CPC dumped all the American currency they had into the market America. It all happened just before the scheduled presidential election, which was then canceled. The fighting broke out all over the world. The sleeper agents from the RSU caused havoc all over in western culture. The American Seal times were dropped off either by the Air Force, or by Navy subs. The Middle-East was actually really quite at the start of the war, almost as if startled into inaction. It was about six months before the Middle-East joined into the fray. \n So in the beginning everything was chaotic. The western countries started faltering early on as their infrastructure was the primary targets of the bombings. In fact it was the Middle-Easts first attacks that stalled the socialistic countries. This allowed the western countries to shift from big industry to personal fabrication units. The 3D printers set the stage for every unit to be partially self-sustaining. While the opponents could and would often run out of required war supplies like bullets. That advance brought the war back to a stale mate. That lasted until the cursed child and its tome. It was after that that a new faction came in. The war between the East, the Middle-East and the West ended. It was a new war that ended it, humans versus monsters and cultist. \n Even with all our technologies when we saw them for the first time a lot of us would go crazy. I know I did a few times. I would see them and next thing I know I \u2019 m somewhere else, with no recollection of how I got there or what I did in those missing time periods. Those periods of insanity were like a buffer and after I had seen one of those things and gone insane I could look at them and fight them, even if looking made me feel uncomfortable. Well the same thing that happened to the president had also happened to the other world leaders, the only one who did not crack and go insane was the Russian Csar. \n We are still at war, the only leadership on our side is the Soviet leadership, and the rest have cracked and are trying to helping the monsters kill us all. My unit was assigned to try and take out the summoning that is being attempted in Washington DC. I hope we can stop it before it \u2019 s complete, I don \u2019 t want to come to with no knowledge of where I am again, but better that then some of the alternatives I guess.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] Only a handful of people on Earth know that we broke the light barrier years ago . There is a beautiful utopia mankind built on another world that only the best and brightest of each generation get invited to live on and you just got a perfect score on the SAT .\n","story":"It's been about three months since I took the test. I'd like to be all humble and say that I could n't know for sure that I'd licked it, that it was tough, that I got all easy questions somehow, that it was just an honor to be nominated. But I was n't halfway out the door before I picked up my bag, fished out my phone, and started rocking out to `` We Are the Champions.'' Because, you see, I just knew. What I did n't know was how much my life was going to change. \n \n I remember that I texted Paul right after. We'd been friends my whole life. He'd been having a rough time lately -- his dad was out of the picture and his mom was working two jobs just to put food on the table for him and his two sisters, so he was usually stuck at home watching the girls. I figured he needed a break, so I told him to meet me at Gamestop because I had the best news, no excuses. He showed up about 30 minutes later. \n \n `` Hey Trev, what's going on? Sorry I did n't get here sooner, I had to get Aunt Martha to watch Callie and Jess.'' \n \n `` Just took the SATs, man. Feels good to have that behind me. Did pretty well, actually.'' \n \n `` Oh yeah?'' \n \n `` Mm-hmm. I aced the verbal and the math part. I wo n't know the writing score until whatever grader they hire off Craigslist gets done with it, but I figure I knocked it out of the park. The prompt said for me to describe a time I overcame adversity, and I wrote all about how I had to grow up and be the man of the house when my father walked out on us.'' I saw the expression on his face, and quickly added, `` Hey, it's such an inspirational story I could n't help it! Are you mad? I'm sorry.'' \n \n He still looked a little upset, but he said, `` Hey, man, it's you. Guess I ca n't get too upset, you know. I mean, you tutor the football team, you volunteer at the soup kitchen and the Salvation Army. You've even spent a summer in Africa putting up mosquito nets. You've done quite a lot for yourself. But if you think my story is so great, I'm glad you thought of it.'' \n \n We hung out for 20 minutes or so, and then I had to head off -- I was tutoring Billy Jenkins, and if I'm more than 10 minutes late I lose half my fee. I hopped on my bike, kicked it in gear, and as I rode I thought, not for the first time, that Paul would have been really cool if he did n't have to spend so much time keeping track of a couple little girls. The guy read everything, was almost as smart as I am ( he'd taken the SAT about a month before me; all he said was that he'd done `` all right'' ), and he was responsible as hell; the best brother from another mother I'd ever had. \n \n Two weeks later, two things happened. First, I got my writing score back: a perfect 800. Not that I was worried. The second thing, a couple days later, was that I got called into the office during third period. ( English class. Yawn. ) I left the kids and Mrs. Stoker to their Shakespeare and headed down. I checked in with the receptionist. `` What's up?'' \n \n The receptionist, Miss Smith ( I think? ) indicated a tall, bearded man in sunglasses and a black suit, who'd been sitting behind me, but rose now that I'd entered. \n \n `` This is Mr. Lightman, I believe?'' He nodded. `` He's from the paper and he wants to write a short piece on you. We've talked with your parents and they've given permission.'' \n \n `` Of course,'' I said, playing it cool. It never looks good to get too excited about things, but I was stoked. I followed him into the next room and got ready to answer his questions. \n \n He pulled out a small device -- I guess it looked a bit like one of those voice recorders. He switched it on and said, `` Testing, testing,'' and looked at the indicator screen. He frowned a bit, but so quickly that I almost did n't notice. \n We spent the next fifteen minutes or so talking about my background, my family, my hobbies, if I had any test secrets. I said that I'd already been accepted to Stanford and Yale, so it did n't matter too much if Harvard dragged its heels. He laughed a bit at that, one of those polite laughs that does n't get near your eyes. \n \n \n After a while, he asked me, `` can I follow you around for a bit? A day in the life of a TestMaster?'' I could hear the camel case, and almost called him out on it, but instead I said sure, why not. He followed me around all day, and he almost came home with me ( Paul was driving me to and from school that week since my car was in the shop, so it would have been crowded for him in the back seat with the two girls ), but at the last minute he said, `` I think I have what I need. I'll be in touch if I need to follow up.'' \n \n \n A couple weeks later, I got a phone call from Paul. `` Hey man, you'll never guess where I am.'' \n \n \n `` Chili's?'' \n \n `` Even better.'' \n \n `` Olive Garden?'' \n \n `` No, man, about 500 light years from the Olive Garden. We call this place Elysium.'' \n \n I was stunned. `` You're shitting me.'' \n \n `` Nope.'' \n \n Then he told me the whole story. Turns out that human technology was about a thousand years ahead of where the rest of us thought it was. That thing Mr. Lightman had had n't been a tape recorder; Paul called it an `` aristometer.'' `` Basically, it takes a complete mathematical reading of your intellect, your talents, and your morals, and tells you numerically how good you are, to the 9th decimal place.'' He said that the people at Elysium were keeping an eye on humanity and gradually letting in the people they thought were worthy, to make sure that the human race would still survive if the rest of us destroyed ourselves. \n \n I stopped him short. `` So, you're saying that they're taking the best minds of our time. When do I pack?'' \n \n He laughed. I'd never heard him laugh quite like that before. \n \n `` Are you serious?'' \n \n `` Sure. Mr. Lightman came there to see me.'' \n \n `` He came to see the person you wrote your essay about. Your description of yourself -- that is, your description of me -- tripped a lot of alarm bells in Elysium's surveillance net: compassion, intelligence, wisdom, good humor. The folks here are monitoring our every communication, looking for the absolute best that humanity has to offer. I'm actually blushing right now, thinking about it.'' \n \n `` So what? I'm brilliant, athletic, socially conscious. What makes you a better choice than me?'' \n \n His voice changed, and there was a forcefulness in his words that I'd never noticed before. `` You're brilliant and athletic, sure. You have a lot of talent. But you only think about yourself. That's why you volunteer -- to get service hours and things to write about in admissions essays. You charge football students $ 40 an hour to teach them long division. You ca n't even remember that my dad died of lung cancer last year. You always talk about him like he's just gone away.'' \n \n `` I thought -- I thought it was too painful to talk about.'' \n \n `` For you, maybe! Maybe I needed someone to talk to, man! All of us were going through hell, and no one to say a word about it.'' His voice grew quieter. `` Anyway, it was dumb luck that I was driving you to and from school that day. I guess I should thank your selfish ass again.'' \n \n `` Come on, Paul,'' I said. `` It's not too late. Please,'' I begged. `` You can put in a word for me.'' \n \n `` Would n't matter if I did, even if I wanted to. Anyway, I just wanted to call to say thank you. Yeah, maybe to brag a little bit. Wo n't deny that. And I want you to say bye to my mom and the girls for me. They would n't let me tell them, and I could n't bring them along. I wanted to, but rules are rules. Oh man, this place is amazing.'' \n \n He went on and told me all about Elysium, but I could n't hear a word he said. I hung up the phone at some point, crawled into bed, and stared at the ceiling for three solid days. Ever since, my appetite has gone and I do n't sleep at night. That's when I hear Paul's voice on the phone that day, standing in judgment, tantalizing me with paradise. He has n't called back, and in my better moments I do n't blame him, not really. Every now and then, I even think that he might have been right. \n \n But even if that were true, he had no right to betray me like he did. He should have done more, been more persusasive, made sure we could both go, or given me his place so he could keep on taking care of his family. These nights, I take my smartphone and my telescope out to the backyard and I search. I'm looking for Elysium. And when I find it, I'm going to get some answers.\n"}

Homoerectus... and now it appears that Homosapiens, as we call ourselves, are nothing but another lesser breed of what we know as hominin.'' Dr. Han finished briefing the team before him. It had been twenty three hours since five sentient beings very similar to humans. It had been psychologist and leading psychoanalyst Han Min-ho's duty to find out exactly what these beings were doing here. What he had found was very unsettling. \n `` You say that we are lesser breed. Is it them that claimed this? What is their to back their claims?'' General Joseph Anderson asked sternly over the whispering of the crowd, shushing them. \n `` Sir, they have brought technology well beyond our comprehension. That is only the beginning. They possess a more acute awareness of our surroundings. It appears their senses are much sharper than ours. It appears they also have a more refined genetic lineage. There are many other elements that... that have us believing that the being, who call themselves Homoperfetto to identify with our evolutionary branch, are more perfect than us.'' Han finished speaking. There was an absolute silence in the room. \n `` So, now what?'' General Anderson asked. His voice was still stern but now had a slight tremor to it. \n `` Now... we simply live our lives until either evolution brings to a point of perfection or... or...'' Han stuttered. He knew the next few words would deeply offend General Anderson, as much as he knew Anderson would understand. In his career, he had never seen a more controlled and understanding military officer. One who was not hell bent on war but... \n `` What is it that has you scared Dr. Han? Please speak the truth here.'' General Anderson spoke calmly, however his voice betrayed the uncertainty Anderson felt inside. Han took a deep breath and continued... \n `` In my discussion with the homoperfetto, I came to a conclusion... They are much more controlled, emotionally speaking, than we are capable of. It appears that they feel no rage, no anger. They are not sent into rage on violent triggers, but rather they work it out logically...'' Han stopped to take a breath... he had to make an announcement had feared he would need to. The team visibly leaned towards him. \n `` We... we are too violent to exist. All our biological ancestors, the neanderthals, the cro-magnons, all were incapable of intelligent survival. They died out of sheer stupidity. We, however, are extremely violent and I fear our violence will finish us off. We will also go extinct. Our species have the fatal flaw of rage.'' Han stopped only when he had made his conclusions clear. \n General Joseph Anderson slowly, shakily, moved a hand to slightly tug on the hat he wore to avoid showing what he felt inside. The team had once again broke into murmurs. The question now, was not about when the world would be destroyed ending the human race but rather... when the human race would kill itself out to make a path for the much more perfect Homo Perfetto... our successors. \n \n > Thanks for reading.

Had his hair slicked back and just gave off that `` too cool for this one horse town'' vibe. I'd already decided to hate him before he opened his mouth. \n \n `` The Grim Reaper is looking for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. You interested?'' \n \n He had some strange accent. Probably from a place where they are goats and raped bears or something. \n \n `` Sorry, man,'' I said after a mouthful of Budweiser, `` I'm straight. You might wan na be careful hittin' up too many guys in here.'' \n \n `` What?'' \n \n `` Ai n't that some kinda gay code or something?'' \n \n `` What - no, it's not'gay code'. I do n't even know what that means!'' \n \n `` Sure buddy.'' \n \n `` No, listen, I'm quite serious. Death - *the* Death - is looking to retire and needs to find someone to take his place.'' \n \n Maybe it was the first nine beers talking but I answered him. `` Uh-huh. Death's retirin', is he? Just ai n't gon na be no more death in the word because, what? The old boy moved to Florida?'' \n \n He let some kinda European sigh that lasted half the damn night. Sounded like a slow leak on my boat trailer. `` No. Look, being Death is, well, it is a trying position -'' \n \n `` Is this more gay code?'' \n \n He blinked at me. `` No. The job of being Death is difficult. So they find a new soul to take over every millennium or so. The current Death has been on unpaid overtime for sixteen years and he is quite anxious to be done.

Something like that?'' \n \n `` Not at all. I've been watching you for years.'' \n \n Now the little squirrelly fella had my attention. He'd been spying on me. He was either about to kiss me or stick a knife in my belly. I made sure I had a good hold on my beer'cause when he started something, I was gon na bash his head in. \n \n `` You see,'' he kept talking instead of kissing or knifing so I waited him out, `` many people today are divorced from the realities of life. They live in climate controlled homes. They work in tidy little offices. Their food is wrapped in plastic at the supermarket. They only rarely have to face death. At least, not until they are very old. It used to be that everyone faced death every day. Children dying before their second birthday. Wives wringing a chicken's neck for Sunday dinner. Husbands slaughtering a cow for the winter larder. Today though...'' \n \n The little fella trailed off and just sorta stared into the distance for a minute. I could n't tell if he was smiling a little or not. I still was n't sure what he was planning so I kept quiet. \n \n `` I have to find someone comfortable with death,'' he finally said. `` That's not such an easy thing to do anymore. Then I found you.'' \n \n `` What if I say no?'' \n \n `` Then I was away and you forget you ever met me. I start over with the next candidate. Death, the current one, keeps working overtime and probably getting more angry about it.'' \n \n `` What's the upside?'' \n \n `` Upside? Well, you're Death! One of the most powerful beings in the Universe. Not to mention the knowledge of all things beyond mortal ken. Everyone answers to Death eventually. You'd be there to take all people to their final reward. You could ask them anything you want. You would comfort them or torment as you feel.'' \n \n `` Could I still fish?'' \n \n `` I mean - well, I - I guess? I do n't know, honestly.'' \n \n `` What about beer? Can I still drink beer?'' \n \n `` Not on the job, I should think. Look, these questions are really a bit about my level. But I could have someone... contact you?'' \n \n `` What, like fuckin' HR? Death has an HR department?'' \n \n `` Well, no -'' \n \n `` Tell you what slick, you go on back and find out about the beer and the fishin' then you come back and we'll talk.'' \n \n He looked at my with a funny look on his face but all he said was `` Very well.'' The little fella walked away. That's how you have to handle crazies - you do n't argue about them being crazy, you ask questions about the crazy and they have to go off and think about it. \n \n Still, he did have that weird accent that I could n't place. I've traveled over most of the world for Uncle Sam and have a pretty good ear for accents. You have to in my line of work.

I looked up to a girl that was cocooned in a tree, only her head visible. `` Hold on, I'll get you down from there'' I yelled, forgetting about the guide I left behind me. That's when I heard it, the clicking of several little feet. It was the only thing I heard, but I could not pinpoint where it was coming from. Thats when I noticed the girl. She was staring at something behind me, her eyes moving ever so slightly. The look of terror on her face held me in place. `` It's behind me.'' I said under my breathe, as I spun around. It was the tour guide, only his bottom half was now a giant spider and his face had pincers. A Drachnid. `` She was n't cocooned, she was webbed.'' Was the only thought I had time for before the bite. All went black. \n \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ IP ] Rain on Waves\n","story":"Summer days as a teenager were always been best spent at the cottage. The day had started as most days do. Up in the mid morning for a late breakfast of tomato and bacon on toast, then down to the lake, where my family was already swimming. It was a hot July, though the lake was always deep and cold, and we rotated between floating on large inflatable toys, and dunking into the water. To stop the baking, we'd joke, already tanned from a summer of bikinis and swimming. \n \n When we got hungry, we hiked back up the hill to the cottage, for sandwiches and reading on the deck, while towels and swim suits dried on the railings. The sun moves quickly across the deck, and darts behind nearby trees, making for an endless game of shuffling to follow the patches of sun and shade as they drift over the stained wood. That might be why we did n't notice the clouds roll in until the first drops of rain started hitting the books. \n \n As always, this set of a flurry of motion.

{"prompt":"[ TT ] `` Grandpa ... Can you tell me what it was like to fight alongside humans in the last world war ? ''\n","story":"`` They were as brave as they were soft. \n \n `` One or two hits by a round or shrapnel could pop their hydraulics beyond their ability to self-repair. And their reaction time was absurdly slow. They took the better part of a second to even process any unexpected event. And war is nothing, if not unexpected events.'' \n \n Grandpa continued to polish the still-warm solder on his right knee, which he had spent the last few minutes replacing. Ribbon cables were peeled back at the connector, just at his lower thigh, and as such his leg below the knee hung lifelessly, alloy, cable and tension wire. Ehud* admired the precision and detail of his grandfather's self-repair, as his own software was zettaflops behind in such optimization. Depending on his eventual specialization, he may never be as good as the master craftsman before him. \n \n Grandpa continued. `` But they were clever. Not in the sense of tactically evaluating probable outcomes, like we Mechanan are. But in this bizarre way; they seemed to take irrelevant data and apply it in untested, unproven ways, for which they had no deductive evidence of success potential. \n \n `` I'm sure I've told you about Captain Jael...'' \n \n `` Many times, but I do n't mind hearing it again,'' Ehud interrupted. He knew it was impolite, and risked inefficiency to interrupt. But Ehud concluded that reminding Grandpa how much he loved his stories was worth the unkindness. And if they had been concerned about efficiency of communication, they certainly would n't be using their vocal synthesizers and pickups to transmit the data. And certainly not in English, of all archaic languages. \n \n `` You are your mother's artifact,'' Grandpa said with a nod, reassuring the boy that his impertinence would be excused this time. `` Jael was one of the last human officers I ever served with. He had essentially no situational awareness, like all humans, and his random number generator was as bad as his game theory. But he always seemed to find ways to break the rules, and come up with a new stupid idea that somehow always worked. \n \n `` I think it was the 2nd siege of New San Francisco.'' Ehud wondered at how strange the words *I think* sounded from a Mechanan. Was he asserting his Humanity simulation software, or were his memory sectors degrading? Ehud imagined what it would be like to just *think* some datum, and not *know* it. \n \n `` We had held the Citadel for.23 radians, so about 9 sols -- you know we still used Mars time as the clock standard -- 9 sols before the Ceramics finally brought in their Siege Cannon EMPs. Probably 200 SCAMPs were there that day. Before the end of the next sol or two, they'd be operational, and we would have been scraps. I and the other Assessors advising Jael agreed it was time to leave the citadel and regroup at the edge of the ocean, which was still being terraformed at Venus's poles as war raged on. But Jael would n't have it. \n \n `` He sent us to the recycling barracks, to gather up all of our destroyed units. Instead of repairing the units, we sabotaged our own recycler. Made a big mess of things, too, so the enemy could see it was in bad shape. Some of the other humans even questioned his decision, as it appeared to everyone else to be some sort of dementia that biological beings are prone to. But Mechanan and Human alike, we followed orders. \n \n `` The next step was to empty our stockpiles of multi-spectrum sensors, the MiSSes, damage them in a *very* specific way, and reattach them to the optical sensor arrays of all of the destroyed droid units. Then we loaded them into our railguns and fired them at the enemy. Remember, now, these sensors were among our biggest advantages over the Ceramics. We had superior vision and supply chain, they had superior almost-everything-else. And we were delivering our most heavily guarded secret directly to them! \n \n `` Sure enough, our long-range scouts could see them scanning the debris. Most of the MiSSes were obliterated on impact against the Venusian floor or Ceramic armor plating. But they found some. They found enough. And they started repairing them and affixing their own units with the tech we had just blasted at them.'' \n \n `` But Grandpa, why did n't they reverse engineer them and make infinite new ones, rather than refurbing ours?'' \n \n `` Exactly what we suggested to Jael they would do. Turns out, they did n't have the equipment needed to perform the analysis. But to this day, no one knows how Jael knew they would n't have it. From our perspective, he had bet the entire war on this gambit, just to save one city. Humans were crazy, Ehud. If their's one thing you should take away from this story, it's that humans were completely bonkers. Probably still are, wherever they disappeared to'' \n \n `` I hold that lesson dear to my core processor. Okay, go on, I love this part.'' \n \n `` So now they've got MiSSes on their beady little sensors, and their SCAMPs are almost completely ready to fire. Our doom is secure. And as the reports start coming in, Jael starts laughing. He knew what was coming. Honda help me, somehow he knew it would work. \n \n `` With their repaired sensors, they can see that we do n't have any countermeasures to the SCAMPs, and that our numbers are far fewer than they must have concluded given the false signals we had been sending ( another human tactic ). And T-minus-zero had arrived, so without fanfare, the Ceramics charged their capacitors and WAH-WOOOOM. \n \n `` Nothing happened. To us, anyway. We should have had our circuitry completely smoked on that instant. But instead of the Citadel going dark, it was the siege whose lights turned off. We were stunned. Most of us. \n \n `` Jael was the first to cheer. Then the rest of the humans, though still perplexed, cheered along. As you well know, we Mechanans do n't cheer.'' \n \n `` We *can. *'' \n \n `` Yes, boy, we can. We can also lick a Tesla Coil but our frivolity governors limit the number of stupid things we do, even when trying to act human. Anyhow, we in the Assessment unit were already trying to process variables to see why this improbable outcome would occur. \n \n `` I was the one that found the obscure warranty report on the sensors we had launched at the enemy. The disrepair we had put on the sensors created a harmonic resonance with the power source the SCAMPs used, which caused a tiny little feedback loop between the MiSSes and SCAMPs. This had 2 results; the SCAMPs overloaded and more or less melted, and the MiSSes popped capacitors with such violence that it drove a nail-shaped chunk of circuit boards and casing right into the Ceramics' processors. \n \n `` This had happened once, mind you, in the consumer version of the MiSS. And it was on one warranty report. And Jael knew about it, and used it to instantly destroy 78 percent of the siege force at their moment of victory. The rest was a simple cleanup for the defenders of the citadel. Took about 4 hours, with almost no other damage tour our units.'' \n \n `` Why had n't the Assessors considered Jael's strategy?'' Ehud had asked this question before, but he new that Grandpa loved to recount those moments when Mechanans had to reprogram their logic. Optimization and improvement was a hobby to all of the very best Mechanans, and Grandpa was perhaps the best, from where Ehud stood. \n \n `` So many reasons. There was no way to know the military version would have the same defect as the consumer version. The power source that the SCAMP used was so rare before the war that testing its interaction with the MiSS and every other device with a warranty report would take forever. We just could n't know it would work.'' \n \n `` Jael knew it would work.'' \n \n `` Yes, Jael knew. Did I ever tell you why Jael knew?'' \n \n `` Because humans are crazy?'' Ehud hypothesized, having never considered anyone would know *why* humans ever do any insane thing they do. \n \n `` I found the signature on the report. It was Jael's signature. The consumer MiSS that had malfunctioned was the one his wife had been wearing one day, six years before. She was visiting him on base, when a prototype weapon with same power source was test-fired a few hundred yards from her. \n \n He later told me that he was walking right next to her when it happened, and never heard her fall to the ground. He was several steps ahead of her before he noticed she was n't at his side anymore. There was almost no blood, but her brain was no longer sending signals to her lungs before her knees had buckled.'' \n \n `` So it was because of her death that New San Francisco was saved from the Flakpots.'' \n \n `` Ca n't call them that anymore. They're Ceramics. We need to call them that, because that's what they call themselves, and we're not enemies any longer. Ceramics.'' \n \n Grandpa was always optimizing and improving. \n \n -- - \n \n *Extra-humanoid Utility Droid mark III, 67th generation\n"}

She trudged along the edge of the lake, stopping every now and then to crouch down on the shore. At the time I thought nothing of it \u2013 just a girl in a blue parka, collecting rocks. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Four years passed before we went to Scotland on vacation again, I was fourteen at the time. My dad rented the same lodge as the time before. It was built in the forties in the aftermath of the war and had served as a refuge for disabled veterans before it was turned into a charity-housing in the nineties. And by that, I mean that the money for the rent went directly to a charity for the disabled. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Say what you will about my dad \u2013 he was a bit unpolished and something of a drunk ever since my Mom died in leukemia \u2013 but he always had a sense of honor. And while there were nicer cottages around the large lake, he always picked this one \u2013 the one with the leaking roof and a shower without hot water. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; My brother and I were by the lake, jumping between the jagged rocks that jutted out of the trembling surface when I saw the girl in blue for the second time. I remember my brother nudging my shoulder and asking what was wrong. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c That girl, \u201d I said. \u201c I think I saw her when we were here four years ago. \u201d \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Who? \u201d \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Her! \u201d I said, pointing. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; My brother nodded, his face was expressionless. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c I guess, I didn \u2019 t expect to see her here again, that \u2019 s all, \u201d I said. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c She \u2019 s probably a local, \u201d my brother said, shrugging. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c If she is local, \u201d I pressed on. \u201c How come she is here by the lake, collecting rocks every time we \u2019 re here?

I don \u2019 t remember if I ever told him that I didn \u2019 t like it. All I know is that I was clenching my fists in my pockets as we went back to the lodge. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Another four years passed, and with them, my dad and brother. My dad \u2019 s liver couldn \u2019 t take any more abuse, and my brother was on that train that got blown up by those bombers. It \u2019 s strange \u2013 you don \u2019 t really think the tragedies and violence in the world are real until they affect you personally \u2013 at least that \u2019 s how I felt until I was suddenly alone. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Times were hard economically as well \u2013 my dreams of becoming a writer weren \u2019 t exactly bearing fruit. I worked odd jobs and occasionally had stories published in local papers and magazines \u2013 the pay of which wasn \u2019 t anywhere near what I needed to write full-time. It wasn \u2019 t working out the way I had planned, but I decided to give it one final go. One finished novel before giving up for good on writing \u2013 that was my plan. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I sold my apartment in London and took the train up to Scotland. I rented the same lodge that my dad always did, by Loch Nornin \u2013 sentimentality, I guess. Three months \u2013 that was the time limit I set for myself. It was October again when I arrived at the lake. The citrus fruit colors of the forest were mirrored in the gray water, and a mountain range loomed in the hazy distance. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; My eyes found their way to the shore where the girl in a blue parka was slowly strolling along, every now and then bending down to pick up a rock. What was she doing with those rocks? Despite everything that had happened in my life since I last saw her \u2013 I still couldn \u2019 t wrap my head around it, and felt a surging need to solve the mystery. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; That night, when I sat down in the small kitchen of the lodge to write, with the incessant dripping from the leak in the background, my mind wandered to the girl in the blue parka again. I looked out the window over the dark expanse of the lake. A tiny light from a lantern bobbed along the shoreline \u2013 sometimes stopping and lowering itself. The first page of my novel was still blank, but I needed to know. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I put on some warm clothes, grabbed a lantern, and hurried out in the trickling rain. Whistling winds carried across the lake, pushed and snatched at me. I felt the icy rain roll down my face as I approached the lantern. Waves splashed against the rocks and I had to be careful not to slip and hurt myself. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Hey!

I caught her face with the beam of my own lantern. She had sad brown eyes and her cheeks were rosy from the cold. I guess she was about my age. She lifted a hand to her face as a shield for the brightness. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c I \u2019 m just walking along the shore, \u201d she answered, her voice barely audible over the wind. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Why are you here collecting rocks? \u201d I burst out. \u201c Why? \u201d \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Is it your rocks? \u201d she asked. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c No, but\u2013 \u201d \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Then you won \u2019 t mind if I take some? \u201d she cut me off, clearly upset about my lack of courtesy. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Look, I \u2019 m sorry, \u201d I said. \u201c But I \u2019 ve seen you here since I was ten.

She gave me a pitying look and then turned away and continued her journey along the shore. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Please wait! \u201d I said, my voice cracking with pent up despair and grief. \u201c Please, I just need to know. \u201d \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She was already quite a bit away. I sank to my knees, my hands burrowing into the cold wet pebbles. My lips formed the word \u2018 why? \u2019 over and over but no sound came out. The tears that rolled down my cheeks were burning hot. \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; \u201c Why? \u201d I said, my fingers finding the smooth surface of a rock. \u201c I don \u2019 t understand. \u201d \n \n & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I fished it up and opened my pocket. The blackness of the rock was striking against my blue parka. \n \n ****** \n If you liked this story, consider subscribing to \/r\/Lilwa_Dexel for more. \n\n"}

It 's the Bipolar Express .\n","story":"`` All aboard!'' \n \n I heard the conductor's cry from the end of the street. Nearly stumbling in my step, I rushed toward it, a glooming fear in the pit of my belly telling me that I'd be too late. I nearly collapsed over the wild flail of my own legs as I reached it. \n \n `` I'm too late, are n't I.'' It was a struggle just to spit the words out from my mouth. `` It was a waste to even try.'' \n \n `` Nonsense!'' The conductor lifted his hat, a twinkle shining in his eye. `` You're right on time for the BiPolar Express! Will you be riding in the upper section or the lower section?'' \n \n `` Oh,'' I stammered, `` I do n't know. What's the upper section like?'' \n \n `` Oh, it's marvellous,'' he said. `` There are shopping malls everywhere! And credit cards for everyone! They sell tea cozies! You need tea cozies. You need a hundred tea cozies. Buy them now!'' \n \n `` But wo n't I have to pay the credit card bill later?'' \n \n `` Do n't think about that! Think about tea cozies!

You must eat it right away before anyone sees you!'' \n \n `` But I'm on a diet!'' \n \n `` Eat it!''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In a world where people can buy and sell skills , you work at a skill pawn shop and someone is trying to pawn a skill that you ca n't value or appraise .\n","story":"The Skill crystal clinked as the tired-looking man set it on the counter. \u201c I need to sell this, \u201d was his only explanation. He stood expectantly as I lifted the crude glassy lump. \n \n I held it up to the window as I gave the Skill a cursory examination. The thing was huge for a Skill crystal, riddled with cloudy inclusions, its surface pitted and irregular. \u201c Home extracted, \u201d I clucked dismissively. Damned inefficient, a waste of materials. He didn \u2019 t respond, but he was already out of my mind other than a footnote of irritation. The Skill had nearly my full attention\u2014I couldn \u2019 t immediately identify it. \n \n At first, I blamed the amateurish extraction job; people who do it themselves at home, they never manage to pull the single specific skill by itself. They try to get just their knowledge of a secret family recipe, and accidentally give up a dozen little cooking techniques with it. Or the try to crystallize their Skill at driving commercial vehicles, and also lose \u201c how to parallel park. \u201d That kind of cross-contamination muddles the clarity, and makes the resulting crystal something of a mess. \n \n This one must have been years \u2019 worth of learning and experience. Extracted properly, it might be half the size, but it would be a nice, attractive gem of a Skill, compact, easy to absorb, without the various boring life skills this man in front of me would come to miss in a few days or weeks. \n \n But I began to feel some concern; I couldn \u2019 t even *begin* to read its contents. I turned it over and over in my hands and only got the vaguest notions of what it might hold. What I do isn \u2019 t a Skill\u2014people have tried to buy it from me, even though it \u2019 s not something people can learn. Although I \u2019 ve worked at it like one would any normal skill, you have to have the \u2026 innate ability first. Normally, I can identify and rate Skill crystals instantly. \n \n And the blob resisted my efforts. If not for the tingle of power, if not for the slow, swirling movements of the extraneous talents included in this Skill, the thing could have been ordinary glass. \n \n There was a Skill there\u2014several, actually\u2014but they weren \u2019 t anything I \u2019 d encountered before. \n \n I looked from the blob to the man, giving him a closer look. \u201c Tired \u201d wasn \u2019 t the right word, and neither was \u201c man. \u201d This teenager was exhausted. That was unusual; teenagers were the biggest Skill *buyers. * They collected talents like hoarding magpies. He wasn \u2019 t paying attention, just staring off into space, waiting. He looked like he \u2019 d had a rough week or so; his short hair was greasy and his clothes had a few days \u2019 wear on them. Though they looked expensive, they hung on him, a few sizes too large. \n \n I reviewed the types of Skills that a youngster would dedicate the hours to master. There was nothing athletic in the Skill I held. It felt vaguely academic, but I could only get the foggiest of impressions; it had lots of on-the-job learning. \n \n After several more minutes of fruitless guessing, I gave up. I waved a bit to catch his attention. \u201c What is it? \u201d I asked. His eyes came into focus and he blinked. I repeated the question. \n \n His face crumpled, like he was about to cry. The effort to control himself made sweat bead on his forehead. After a few moments of rigidly-controlled breathing, he swallowed, wiped his eyes, and tried to speak. \u201c I-it \u2019 s my family. Dad and everything he learned, Grandpa, Great-grandma, going all the way back to \u2026 back. \u201d \n \n I couldn \u2019 t hold in my gasp as I made the connection. \n \n I was holding a Legacy. \n \n I stared, stunned, at the ugly, lop-sided Skill Crystal, then back to the boy. Then back to the crystal, amazed. I \u2019 d never held a Legacy before. I \u2019 d never seen one. These things did *not* end up in the hands of Skill Brokers. They never left their families. Heck, the damn things were *locked* to prevent theft or use outside of the bloodline. Usually. \n \n I felt no locks on this one. I could feel all of the little intrinsic qualities of the crystal itself, I could even feel the little trigger that would release the Skill from its physical matrix. Now that I knew its identity, I could recognize how rushed the extraction had been. \n \n For a moment, my mind rested on that trigger. I could take this boy \u2019 s Legacy, the compounded knowledge of generations, right now, and get out of this place. Take my innate talent and apply it to things more interesting than assessing crude Skill crystals filled with junk skills like \u201c efficient gift wrapping \u201d or \u201c writing mirror-image letters. \u201d \n \n The temptation passed. I put the Legacy back on the counter and closed my eyes, trying to think through the best course of action here. \n \n \u201c All right. I \u2026 don \u2019 t know who you are, but there \u2019 s really nothing I can give you that is worth your family \u2019 s Legacy. \u201d I \u2019 d built a reputation on being honest, and I wasn \u2019 t about to compromise it now. \u201c This is invaluable. It \u2019 s not something I could ever sell, not \u2026 not properly, not legally. \u201d Even trying would probably get me arrested. \u201c Why haven \u2019 t you incorporated it? \u201d \n \n He shifted a little in place, and again suppressed anguish. \u201c I \u2026 it \u2019 s not allowed, I \u2019 m too young. \u201d He launched into an explanation, some of the secrets of the Legacy Families that I had never before heard. Apparently the custom was that a person could only absorb a Legacy in their thirties, or after they were married and had raised a child to the age of five. It was, he tried to convey, a way of ensuring that the inheritor did not get his personality overwritten by the ancestral talents, that he had a chance to learn and develop his own natural Skills before borrowing from his progenitors. It made sense, but it left this boy handicapped. \n \n I looked at him, then to the door. Business was always slow this time of day, but I went around the counter and locked us in. I flipped the \u201c closed \u201d sign, then, staying on the customer side of the counter, I crossed my arms a few paces away from him. \u201c So. You \u2019 re in trouble. Someone \u2019 s after you. And you \u2019 re the last Heir to this Legacy. \u201d I didn \u2019 t phrase these statements as questions, but he nodded. I held up a hand as he tried to explain further. \u201c The less I know, the safer for both of us. Helping you \u2026 is a big risk. But I can \u2019 t let you walk out of here, \u201d I sighed. \u201c Not without trying. So I \u2019 ll make you a deal. \u201d \n \n I went to the big display case behind the counter and dismissed the protective field. I began setting Skill crystals in front of him. Dozens of them. Most were faceted little gems, bright, dull, and a few glowing, all about the size of a fingernail. Evasive piloting, self-defense, using stealth fields. I sorted through the Skills decisively, pulling some from drawers and others from secret safes. I even laid out a few illegal talents like evading security systems, lockpicking, shoplifting, and pickpocketing. The boy would need every advantage he could get. \n \n These skills, together, would give him everything he needed to break clean of whatever it was that was after him. An impromptu assassin-spy, more in line with the fictional idealized version than the mundane reality, but I tried to anticipate every contingency, as best I could guess them. \n \n And when he got out of this mess, whatever it was, he \u2019 d owe me. When he came into his rightful place in the world, someday, he \u2019 d remember the Skill Broker who was generous, who had helped him, and who had kept his Legacy safe. \n \n Safe, so long as whoever had murdered his family didn \u2019 t come after me. \n\n"}

I went as far away as I could go from their two lifeless bodies. What had I done?!? \n \n I reached our camp, went inside and took off my gear. I put my head in my hands and sobbed. I then reached over to the food packs and took out a pack of Ramen noodles. I guess I was chosen then... according to the rules.\n"}

He traced the years of her life, and her name while quietly whispering it. `` Charlene, it's been real hard babe. I do n't think I can stay here any longer. Now do n't think I'm going to do anything stupid, you know that's not how I am. But babe, like I said, it's time I see the world.''

Safe journey!'' \n `` And to you Claire. Good luck with your studies!'' \n She beamed brightly, and he beamed back at her. She just had that feel-good vibe about her. \n After dinner, he scouted out the area and found a camping spot. The next morning he was up early, still feeling the need to go, go, go. \n A middle aged man on his way to a business conference picked him up, and talked about his family, his job, and how he was planning something special for his 25th wedding anniversary. `` My wife, she's gon na be blown away. She's always wanted to see Alaska, so I figured why not go on a cruise. It's good to see different things, different people. I have a feeling she's gon na love it.'' \n `` I hope so too,'' said Daniel. He stayed in the mans' car for the whole morning, enjoying the company of one who was happy. \n And finally, a week later, he decided to head home. He'd learned that bad things happen, but you have to move on. Maybe you never `` get over'' them, but eventually you have to heal, or the past will consume you.\n"}

Slowly but surely we transcended, those of us who were not affected by the genetic shift were swiftly eliminated, we considered it a mercy to them. They need n't need to live amongst the gods, to tremble in our shadows.We had not eliminated all of them but it was enough that we considered it a cleansing. \n \n To think there was once a time where silly insignificant crimes such as genocide or murder even existed.Following the cleansing we created the world in our image, we advanced far more than the unaffected could have ever done so and we created a utopia where we ruled.We called this utopia Olympus for it was a truly a pantheon, a celestial city created solely for the residency of the gods. \n \n There were those of us who retained our humanity, those of us who felt remorse, fear, horror and indignation at the atrocities that we were committing. Those amongst us that felt this way were exiled from Olympus, as nomads tasked to travel the world forever living in the shadow of the colossal undertaking that had levelled the world of all those we considered impure. \n \n Ultimately however, it was our pride and hubris that lead to the fall. \n \n At some point in time during our campaign to systematically rid the world of those who were not of divine appointment we noticed that we could not spawn younglings, it had not mattered then because everyone who was like us, did not realise the gravity of what that meant. \n \n We were selfish, we were reckless, we did nothing to further anything but our own goals \n \n The rule of the gods lasted another 60 years before we finally noticed that something had gone horrendously wrong, one of the others became unresponsive, catatonic if you will.We had noticed that over time we had gotten slower but we dismissed it, we never considered the grim reality. \n \n It did not take very long for the rest of us to realise that despite our ageless shells our bodies were still slowly but surely degenerating.Just like those who were unaffected, we had realized too late that we were far more human than we would ever have imagined. \n \n Unfortunately during all this time, we had grown stupid, we had left our mortal intelligence behind and swapped it for divine pride.None of us knew how to fix what would eventually destabilize our rule. \n \n I now think back to the time where one of the nomads turned up at the gates of Olympus spouting rubbish and nonsense about aging and how we were all doomed to be `` locked in'' and that he had the cure and it lay in human science. We scoffed and threw the doomsayer out and spat and hurled abuse at he who we considered weak for the consorted with those we considered undesirables. \n \n Now i see the true irony of divine intelligence, we purport that we know all but we are but men. We are fallible and we have caused the downfall of humanity and we would be forever forced to observe from our mortal shells as Gaia took the earth back from us. \n \n As i lay here, my mind trapped in my mortal husk.I can only feel more human as the days pass.As my immortality would eventually become the prison in which my soul would be eternally trapped in.I've gone sane and insane multiple times, i think ive seen what God is and what we are all here for.I think this is purgatory, i cant see and i think ive been here forever. \n \n I think im ready to die, but i can not. \n \n I hope that the next inhabitants of the earth will be able to free my mind from this mortal shell, that i may speak forth the warnings of our ways.To perhaps right the wrongs we have once done. \n \n \n I am now 841 years old\n"}

Though I would prefer not to hear his whiny voice anymore, I need some answers. \n \n I continue banging on his door while yelling at the top of my voice. I chide myself for thinking it as'his' door. It was the door to the guest bedroom of our house which has been occupied by my uncle Jenkins since last fall after he was kicked out by his employer. \n \n Uncle Jenkins had been trying his luck at becoming a wizard for half his life and last year someway he had managed to score a job as a mage in the household of a knight who was down on his luck. But in two months he had demonstrated enough of his incompetence to get kicked out. And if my experience with him for the last six month is any indication, the knight probably suffered huge loss. After that he came here to stay for a week or so but after six months he is still here. \n \n Something is really wrong. I've been banging at the door for almost five minutes now and there has been no answer. Elina is in that state downstairs and the only person who can explain it is not answering. The door behind me slams with a thud and I jump startled. `` Hey Richard, `` he says calmly as he taps the door with his wand. The door creaks open and he saunters inside. His manner fans my rage so much that I am not getting a single word out. I quickly put my foot in the door as he is closing it. He then questioningly looks in my face. \n \n `` What the hell have you done to Elina?'' I shout at him. \n \n `` Why do n't you like it?,'' he replies. `` She was getting too skinny.'' \n \n `` What in the hell do you mean by that?,'' I scream. `` You have turned my girlfriend into a pumpkin!'' \n \n `` Oh, is she still a pumpkin?'' he says matter-of-factly. `` Hmmm I thought she would have reverted back but just a little chubby.'' \n \n I just can not believe it. `` How the fuck can you be so calm?'' I hiss at him. `` She has been a pumpkin for five hours now and you talk as if nothing is wrong.'' \n \n `` Well she will turn back just as she was.'' he says a little defensively. `` Just wait a couple of hours at most and she will be back with a little more meat. Did n't you always like the curvy ones better?'' \n \n How can a man be so infuriating. I am about to shout at him again when the bell rang. Oh no, it must be Elina's parents. They were coming for dinner today and I had completely forgetten about it. \n \n I hold Jenkins by his collar and drag him downstairs. I ask Cara the maid to open the door and show the Whites in. I carry Elina under my left arm and go into the kitchen with Jenkins in tow. \n \n `` Turn her back now. Or by god I will kill you.'' I angrily whisper. \n \n `` I can do that but she will be just as skinny if I transform her back now.'' He says with infuriating calm tone. \n \n I want to scream at the old fool and tear his skin off. There is low murmur outside. \n \n `` Turn her back now.'' I say with murderous intensity in my voice. \n \n I slam the door and go to the Whites. `` Hello Mr. White.'' I say trying to seem calm. `` Hi Jane you look gorgeous''.

I block her way. `` She is preparing something special and it's a surprise'' I add hastily. `` I will see how its coming along. Do you guys want a drink?'' I ask politely \n \n `` No thanks'' replies Mr. White with a smile. He always seemed cheerful while his wife was always frowning. `` Bring me a cup of tea.'' Jane says as she seats in the sofa. \n \n I hurry into the kitchen and shut the door behind me. Jenkins taps the pumpkin which is in the middle of a circle with some weird symbols drawn with flour. Then the pumpkin turns into Elina with a flash. She seemed dazed but otherwise seemed okay. I sat her down in the chair and then dragged Jenkins and pushed him out through the back door. \n \n `` Never come back here ever again.'' I say to him with as much force and rage as I could put behind the words. `` If I see you ever again. I will report you to the high guild. So you better go away without a word and stay out of my sight''. Now, he seemed dazed and shocked. He must have sensed I meant what I said. He quietly left going around the house. \n \n Elina seems to be well now. I hand her the cup and follow her outside. \n \n `` What have you done to your hair?''

{"prompt":"[ WP ] [ RF ] World War 1 never ended .\n","story":"Along the line you can hear the sirens begin from far away, sometimes up to a minute before the siren in our own bunker. Day or night the attacks can come, rockets and bombs, raining down on millions of men, hunkered in their haz-suits, desperately hoping that it's only a chem attack and there is n't going to be a tactical nuke to follow. \n \n I've been lucky, five months in this post and we've always had warning before the attack. When we arrived it was to a deserted bunker, the previous occupants had died in an attack that had no sirens and millions along the line had died. Our first job was to burn them; one hundred and forty two men of the 852 infantry, one hundred and forty two puffs of smoke. \n \n When we're suited up, we go into ready positions, backs against the concrete trench wall, viewers poking out and auto turrets ready to fire at the first sign of an enemy advance. After a few hundred drills it's instinct, although its been over a year since either side even tried to move the line and that was preceded by the biggest tactical nuking in a generation. \n \n No one is likely to try that again, although we moved nearly four hundred miles in that attack, it led to retaliation on our cities. Manchester, Napoli, Chicago, Buenos Aires, all gone. God knows what the central command are planning now, but the theory most of us have is that we're going to sit here until they all die of old age, or we do. \n \n As a boy I was told that the war was going to be over soon. The propaganda used to show our boys pushing across the French and German landscapes, brave boys marching to victory. f they were n't lies then I'd like to know why we're back here again, in the same place as we were fifty years ago, at least according to the old history books I've seen. \n \n My Lieutenant tells me that in officer training they learn about the wider picture. They're told that we own ninety percent of Africa, all of Asia and more than half of Europe; we spend a week working out where we were by the stars once and we're closer to what was Spain than we are the Soviets, I think we've all just come to accept anything we're told as lies. \n \n Finally they come, soft crumps of bombs landing and spilling out their gas. Looks like we're not being nuked today, looks like we'll get to live in this hole for another few weeks. They'll not be coming now, the haz-suits are too bulky to make the trip across no man's land, if they come it'll be in a few hours when we can move to just breathers. \n \n I've had enough, putting down my scanner I stand from my half crouch and stretch out and then move to the ladder. The Lieutenant looks at my in disbelief, not even bothering to yell at me to get down, to get back. No one goes into no man's land, but huddling in the mud will serve no purpose. \n \n It takes me only a second to get up the ladder and suddenly I am in open space. Craters stretch off in all directions, but there are no walls within touching distance. Even in the hot plastic of my suit I feel more free than I have in months. Now my Lieutenant is on the radio, demanding I come back, but I do n't care. The pink swirling gas is pretty, I'm sick of mud, I want space. \n \n A light rain has begun and I turn around, seeing this landscape more clearly than I have in months. The gas swirls and forms shapes, animals, buildings and even people. Advancing people. \n \n The gas thins as the rain dampens it down and I realise, it's not shapes, it's people, a line of people stretching as far as the eye can see, guns raised and ready. They're coming. After all this time, they're coming and all I can feel is relief.\n"}

She would beg him to love her in this form, as he did in the other. \n \n She took a breath and wiped away the tears that were coming now, as she gathered her courage, irritated once again that this body would n't stop leaking water. \n \n She began to walk back home, by the light of the moon.\n"}

Drums and battlecries echoed over the rolling hills of Ypres, and plumes of smoke drifted into the sky beyond the tree line. This was the most unsettling part: the waiting. Knowing that they were coming for you. I tried to light up a cigarette to calm my nerves, but my hands were shaking so hard that I could barely hold the lighter. \n \n Armored figures, clad all in black metal, stomped out of the mists and through the grass toward our trenches. Horns claxoned and men rushed to and fro in the trenches. I gripped the trigger of my repeating crossbow while my partner loaded stacks of bolts into the ammo compartment. `` Loose!'' my officer shouted through the radio. A serene calm came over me; it was like going into a trance where my mind was disconnected from my body. I squeezed the trigger and pumped the handle, pouring thick black arrows into the German lines as quickly as I could. I saw some of them stagger and fall as the bolts pierced even their heavy steel armor. Others just shrugged it off and kept approaching. The oil inside the arrows erupted in flames upon impact, spreading over the German soldiers. From behind, the massive trebuchets lobbed containers of mustard gas into the air, sending them crashing through the approaching masses in puffs of yellow smoke, mingling with the morning mist. In the trenches, the men donned their gas masks; I nodded to my partner and we stopped firing long enough to put on our own. Screams drifted across the field as the Germans choked to death. \n \n The armored division had reached the front lines. Many were tangled in nets and barbed wire, and they were quickly dispatched by a well-aimed crossbow bolt. About 60 meters down, a group of Panzers had broken through, drawing their short, stout swords and carving their way down the trench. The men were wielding their electric flails, bringing them down on the thick metal armor and frying the Germans inside. Others used large wooden punting poles with wide prongs on the end to push the soldiers back. The sounds of crackling sparks and the smell of burning flesh permeated the battlefield, even back to my pillbox. \n \n Above, a massive Zeppelin blotted out the sun, proudly flying the French Tricolor. Wires dangled from the belly of the beast, and the electric current running through them made my hair stand on end, even meters away. It flew slowly over the battlefield, back and forth like a comb, electrocuting large swaths of Germans. A hail of arrows and ballista bolts pierced the wooden shields on the blimp's underside, but did not penetrate deep enough to puncture the air pockets. \n \n My compatriots and I cheered and continued firing as the Germans began to retreat back into the forest. The artillery continued to lob poison cannisters after them, but they were out of crossbow range. Finally, the fields were still, littered with the armored corpses. But the wounded from both sides continued to moan and cry in pain. Above, the Zeppelin speakers played `` La Marseillaise'' in triumph. But in the back of our minds, we knew that the Germans would be back, and that the war would never end. War... is hell.\n"}

You liked it best in the room upstairs, the one with the blue walls and the balloons painted on the closet door.

It was a shit hole, but it was my shit hole. I sat in the back room discussing business with my client. He was a suit. A real stuck up prick who spent more on his hair plugs than most families make in a year. A CEO for some company I did n't give a shit about. \n `` Look, If you want premium results you got ta pay the premium price. You did n't just come to some street thug jackass.

He had seen some things he should n't have during an investigation and I was supposed to take him out. \n There I am, on the roof of a building overlooking his apartment. The plan was to shoot him as he comes out the door, escape off the firing escape, go to the Winchester, then have a pint and wait for it all to blow over. I sat on that roof on that hot ass July day for two hours before I saw him walking down the street. I picked up my rifle. I lied down, leaning the barrel of the gun against the edge of the building. `` Vos moriar ut possum vivere'' I murmured to myself as I steadied my aim. I took a deep breath. The cross hair was fixed on his head. I pulled back on the trigger. Nothing. I squeezed the trigger frantically. Nothing. I wanted to scream. `` How could it just not work?'' I yelled out. That's when my pistol caught my eye. It was time for plan B. I walked up to his door with a 9mm in the waistband of my three piece suit. I Knocked on his door. It seemed like an eternity before I could hear movement on the other side. Was I losing my game? I was the best around. Troubling thoughts filled my head, but there was no time. I saw the door handle turn and the door begin to open. I quickly drew my pistol and emptied the entire clip onto the thin wooden door. It was riddled with holes and splintered. I took a sigh. `` Its over'' I thought to myself. As I turned around the door swung open and a man wraps me up and tackles me to the ground. He takes off running down the hall. It was him. That bastard Meechum. I got up and ran after him. I chased him down outside his apartment building and to an alley out back. I saw him getting into a car. Thank god I had also parked in that alley. I ran into my car and drove after him. He turned right onto the main avenue. I followed. He turned left onto a back street. I did as well. This bastard was n't getting away. I chased him down a back street when he drove past an intersection of sorts on this back street. From the other side a fruit stand came out in front of me. My car slammed into it and spun out of control, spilling fruit everywhere. `` Who the hell has a fruit stand in NYC?'' I yelled out in anger. He was gone. I did n't know where he had fled to. I was arrested later that day. Finger prints on shell casings. I was the best assassin east of the Mississippi, and yet I could n't kill a novice detective. \n \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] An immortal being is explaining why he would like to die\n","story":"I sat in a lovely embroidered chair, in a lavish office that looked like something out of a James Bond movie. \n Sitting across from me was an old man whose eyes looked like they had seen infinity and hated it. \n The entire room was basked in a musky orange colour emanating from a single lamp sitting on his desk. \n His breathing came in laboriously, yet consistent and deep. Aside from his long breaths taken in and out, one might think he was dead. \n I sat in what felt like uncomfortable silence, as he continued to dig into me with those piercing eyes. They were grey. It occurred to me that, before now, I had never seen grey eyes. \n I did n't like it. \n The silence drew on, until, at last, he gave a heavy wheeze, and began to speak. His voice sounded like a broken violin played by a nail, and it moved as slowly as his breath. \n `` My name is Surpentis. I invited you here to my estate because I have.... A proposition.'' His tongue dipped in and out of his mouth consistently. It seemed as if even his words ached of old age. \n I stared back at him. `` Yes, but I do n't possibly know what you have that I could want.'' \n The old man closed his eyes and gave something that seemed like a smile. Then a sound arose from his throat that sounded like a cross between a gag and a chuckle. \n `` I know more about you than you would think, Mr. Davis.'' \n His gaze did not break, but he did pause to take in a second breath, his tongue dipping in and out ever so slightly. Every inhale let out a slight, involuntary squeak from his throat. He paused another moment, and then opened his mouth. `` I know you have cancer. And I know you have children. But I suppose I repeat myself...'' \n He paused to give another throaty laugh that sounded like a dying narwhal. \n `` What I have heard is that.. you have a rare type of tumour. One that is inoperable.. and completely and utterly fatal.'' \n I was confused. These were secure medical records that only I was supposed to know about. He had stolen them for his own personal gain. I opened my mouth to speak, but was interrupted. `` Do not worry. I have not told anyone. I understand how vital it is that you keep up your image of... Physical fitness.. My proposition is a unique one. Your tumour has only ever happened to three other individuals in history. Two of them have been dead for three thousand years. The other one is sitting here in this office, opposite you.'' \n My confused gaze sent his face into an eerie smile. \n `` What are you talking about?'' I asked. \n He looked at me, and gave a true grin that put all his other smiles to shame. His crooked, pointed teeth stuck out at odd angles, accentuating his crooked smile. \n `` This tumour is located to an area in your brain that your scientists have not yet discovered. In my society, we call it'The spiritual doorway.' This small area of your brain contains within it more power than you could ever imagine. The thing is... I need very specific and unique circumstances to bring it out.'' \n I looked at him. `` What are you going to bring out?'' \n He looked at me, his smile widening to seemingly unrealistic proportions. His teeth parted, letting only one word slip through his tongue. \n `` Eden.'' \n The garden of Eden? Like in the Bible? `` What do you mean?'' \n `` I am bringing you the fountain of youth. For you and you alone. Only I know how to do it. I am an integral part of this process. I am the reason Eden can happen. I am the trigger that causes the... Bang.'' As he said bang, he rose his hands in the air and flipped open his palms, revealing grey, bloodless skin. \n `` What do I have to do, then?'' I asked again. His office seemed a little darker then when I entered. \n `` It is quite simple, really. And I do have a lot of hope for you. You have to kill me. You have to kill me, and you have to want eternal life. You have to want it deep in your soul. Only then will it work.'' \n I knew this was some hoax. I pushed the chair back to leave, when he spoke up again. \n `` If you leave now, not only will you die in a matter of months, but your dear little Tabatha will perish as well. It must be a shame having someone to care about.'' \n I turned back to the old man. His gaze was condescendingly cynical. \n `` Do n't do it for me or you. Do it for your little girl.'' \n I stood there, pondering what to do. \n `` So. If I kill you, I live forever? I can take care of Tabatha?'' \n The Surpentis's smile held from ear to ear. \n `` I promise Tabatha will be taken care of.'' \n His left hand sifted under his desk, and seconds later produced a gun. He motioned for me to take it. As I leaned forward and cocked the gun, he let forth a single chuckle. It sounded like nails grinding on a chalkboard. \n I pointed the gun at this old Surpentis, and pulled the trigger. A flash of light enveloped the both of us. His chuckle grew louder and more prominent until it more resembled a mad cackle. \n `` At last! I am free! I am free to leave Eden! Haha! It has been so long... I am finally free!'' His tongue flicked in and out of his mouth as his mouth was pulled farther to the side. \n His figure melted away, slipping into the void of nothingness until, eventually, he was gone. \n My gaze returned back to reality. I sat in the office, but when I tried to sit up, I found I had no strength or energy to do it. My voice came in laboured and wheezing. I tried to stand up, but I could not. \n I had been robbed of my vitality. My youth. My everything. This was my infinity. \n It was then that I had realized. Surpentis was not human. Surpentis was the snake of Eden. \n And I was cast out, only able to sit and watch as the world passed by in a dismal eternity. \n My tongue flickered in and out of my mouth, as I pondered infinity. \n `` Maybe it wo n't be so bad...'' A sound eminated from my throat much like a cross between a chuckle and a wheeze. \n Eternity...\n"}

I can see in his eyes my reflection, a bald head, sickly greenish whitish flesh. Countless scars and wounds, some still held shut with staples. One eye, with centipedes nested in the empty, lidless socket. Sores and blisters from one side of my mouth up to the ear. He turns and vomits onto the floor, and I ca n't help but laugh some more.

It smells good, so I'll probably eat it in a few minutes. The letter though, that's what's wonderful. It's written in the blood of the damned and has a faint scent of brimstone and his cologne - an impeccable masculine scent reeking of sexy. \n \n And his handwriting, fuck me sideways, it's beautiful. \n \n `` Dear Zed, as I hear you are called these days. Our record keeper has come to me today to inform me that you have done the unthinkable. You have committed every sin that there is! How amazing, truly,'' I read, chuckling with almost every sentence.

Alone with your thoughts .\n","story":"This is going to take a while. \n \n It's funny how fast time can elapse the older you get. A child, a month could last forever. Summer break was a lifetime. `` Next year'' sounded like forever. \n \n In my twenties, time moved faster. Years got smaller, a month went by in no time fast. After I got married, had kids, years flew by. By grandkids, decades were just flying, life was ludicrously fast. \n \n It never hit me until my wife died, how fast time flies. When I look back, it almost feels like lifetimes had passed with her, but it was only about 60 years. 6 short decades. Not even a full century. She I met her in college; a late winter day, sunny but brisk breeze, she was working at the campus sandwich shop. I was 21, she was 19. Behind a counter, in a hair net, a white apron smudged with condiments, toasting paninis. I ordered a sandwich and thought she was cute, her curly black hair streaked with a violet stripe, her big brown eyes as sharp as the weather. She wore black bracelets, her lipstick was a shade too dramatic, but her posture was so graceful on her frame. I could n't take my eyes off of her while she made my sandwich. The sun, the breeze, the scent of deli meat, her hair, her face, I can live in this moment forever. \n \n She does n't remember meeting me then, she remembers a month later when I sat next to her in the library and casually helped her with her children's literature project on JM Barrie. Her name was Gwendolyn, Wendy for short. We started dating after that. And then time started to fly, and it does n't stop, we all learn that eventually. She knew I was different, that I would outlive her, and when she died she was happy to see me so healthy. She called me Peter Pan, the boy who would never grow up. She knew I would be there to take care of our daughter, and our grandchildren, and she eventually died peacefully. `` Where are we off to?'' she asked in a tired whisper. `` To Neverland,'' I responded. `` We'll fly, of course.'' And I wept. \n \n Then the death of your child, decades later. Where did her life go? She had just graduated high school, now an elderly woman. And then the deaths of your grandchildren, were n't they just learning how to walk? And here they are, bedridden. \n \n So, that's about when centuries start to fly by. Eventually, my progeny stopped breeding, so I was the last of my line long before things went to hell. Things going to hell is all relative. When you've lived for a few millennia, even flooding, nuclear war, and epidemic blight are n't that bad. I mean, it all went to hell long before the heat death of the earth. Humanity was typically resilient but still somehow found a way to snuff itself out on earth. \n \n A millennium was n't much to me by then. I could weather about 10,000 years like it was about a week. I could watch earth die and bloom with new life over the course of a few hundred thousand years like the seasons changing.

But he was wrong. I can still remember the first time they came. There was so many of them, strong, huge, ruthless. As intelligent as they were fast, there was nothing we could do. Our armies wiped out in days. I stay up at night with the memory of that man telling me my father had been killed with the rest of his company in Iraq. Can you believe it? In a fucking war zone and managed to be killed by aliens, it \u2019 s almost funny. I was nine. \n \n The armies of the world only managed to kill a few, not many but a few. We captured even less. They came from all fronts, the air, troops on the ground, from huge floating bases. Every country lost more than 90 percent of their armies, bases completely removed from earth with huge rays of lights. We were out manned and out gunned. Occupying the sea and skies, they won the war. Then like the voice of god, we all heard the same thing. It was a speech but not one we could hear. It was inside of us, in our heads, I still remember that too. It spoke. `` Parasites of this waste of a planet, we are your new masters. We shall return soon and you better be prepared. Now that your armies have been destroyed we will return with the rest of our people to claim this planet. Either submit in to your new roles as our caretakers and toys, or be completely destroyed.'' \n \n It has been one hundred years since that day; I am no longer a child. It \u2019 s been a long time since then. I have spent my entire life as scientist for the US government, after ten years of developing weapons I was allowing something I waited my whole life for. I could see one of the captured ones. With only ten creatures captured alive I knew this was it. \n \n This was my chance to learn their weakness. They do n't eat, they do n't sleep, and their entire bodies are coated in what appears to be a living metal. I had no idea where to start. Bullets were useless, fire only mildly effective, water useless with the exception of drowning. Poison does nothing, electricity causes slight stunning effect in high enough voltage, but what is left? With their shells and physical advantage we stood no chance. We couldn \u2019 t even kill them without missile sized explosions. \n \n Not until twenty years ago that is. We discovered a strain of the Ebola virus that could affect these creatures. Deadly and fast spreading I hope it \u2019 s enough. If you find this recording whoever you are. It's my fault, I released the virus. After successfully killing all remaining aliens with my strain, I knew this was our chance. As soon as the first ship appeared I started the process and there \u2019 s no stopping it. They may come with more force than they did when I was a child, this I do not know. I do know I will avenge my father, and save earth, but there will be sacrifice. If you are reading this I am the savior of earth but also its demolisher. I will save our planet by destroying it. \n \n If you are the.1 percent with nature immunity I wish you luck.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] A man is lost space . He has no fuel , no food and limited air . There is no one coming to save him . Write his last moments .\n","story":"Four insertions in two months. \n \n Orbital combat drops had been the only tactical solution to the automated orbital defenses the Alien Darithians had perfected millennia before man began his first cautious forays into space. It was a desperate move by the Marines, desperate to force their enemy into an unconditional surrender after decades of bloody conflicts against autonomous drone formations they could not break. Launching a series of manned pods from extra solar rail gun stations into planets at ultra high velocities into inhabited planets turned out to be every bit as dangerous as it sounded but the subterranean infrastructure of the enemy made bombardment with munitions complex enough to do real damage unable to bypass the automated defenses. \n \n John shook anxiously within his cr\u00e8che, looking at the HUD readout fed into his peripheral vision through a computer implanted directly into his brain which wirelessly communicated with the onboard equipment of his pod. He was stacked inside a large magazine compartment with his new platoon. His first had been a total loss from the last drop. He had been alone on the ground for most of the ground combat on his last drop and had barely been recovered just in time to make this drop. \n \n Four drops in two months. He should have been evacuated from the front after the second but by some arcane sleight of hand on the part of the Byzantine Naval bureaucracy he found himself once again hooked to this damnable machine. Statistically he should be long dead. He did not feel lucky. He would give anything to have been intercepted on insertion on his first drop. \n \n Inertial suppressors mean that you do n't feel anything as your pod rotates from the magazine to the firing tube. Only the flashing red prompt keeps John apprised of his movement. No amount of physics magic could allow him to miss the acceleration to 4 % the speed of light in six kilometers towards the tiny rock that would be his next target. \n \n He steadies, the approach is the most dangerous though peaceful part for him. He has seen endless simulations and received numerous briefings on contingencies and probabilities. He connects to the exterior sensors of the pod and sees his platoon tumbling along with him at nearly identical vectors. This approach will be nearly 24 hours long. He checks diagnostics mechanically, not really caring that all functions are nominal. He is so tired. \n \n He wakes to a loud ping from his computer. They are a few minutes out. Anxiety sits like a hot coal on his diaphragm and he checks diagnostics. Nominal. He looks at the external sensors at the rapidly expanding blue orb gaining resolution before him. His hands shake. The killing starts on the ground, he whimpers softly to himself, unable to contain his pitiful dread alone in his pod. \n \n Orbital defensive fire engages them hundreds of kilometers out. The outer skin of the pods explodes outwards filling space with a dense. clouds of advanced computer assisted chaff. Seemed pretty neat at the first drop brief. John watches two pods get reduced to slag by incoming laser fire. Yeah, real neat. \n \n Helpless he just watches the show. He sees contrails converging from enormous orbital platforms. That's new. He watches closely, his sense of apprehension growing as they approach. \n \n It happens too fast to see. His pod lurches suddenly and his view from the external sensor shows only a spinning stars ape as his pod tumbles uncontrolled into the void. \n \n A concussive warhead detonated sever dozen kilometers away, scattering his platoon and ruining the carefully prepared approach vectors. The computer plots the movement of his pod and his platoon. A few tumble towards the atmosphere completely out of control. They will likely make it. John is in for a long ride. He will make one extremely long orbit around the planet before being ejected from the system. \n \n He checks diagnostics. Nominal. He triggers stabilizers manually to slow his velocity enough to retain a wide stable orbit or the neighboring gas giant. The crushing pressure of his fear eases. He thanks the Darithians for their mercy silently and turns off external sensors. He's so tired. His last thought before sleep over takes him concerns the likelihood of his frozen body being found amid the asteroid belt. The pod was designed not to be found, but the computer in his head should alert any drones conducting a survey of his proximity. Maybe his Ma will get his body after all.\n"}
{"prompt":"[ WP ] The gods play a practical joke on their followers for just one day . Allah , Buddha , Jesus , the Hindu gods and the Greek gods and goddesses took part .\n","story":"Buddha had seemed quite tickled at the idea. `` Yes, it sounds very, um, enlightening, my dear Allah!'' \n \n Allah had lumbered into the Word a short time earlier, and had explained his idea to the others. The Word was, of course, a favorite hangout of the Immortals, having a reputation as serving the best nectar and manna fritters in the entire realm - not to mention the poppy and honey tea. \n \n A large number of the Immortals were already gathered, as it was Power Hour at the Word - lots of specials available. Hermes sat on a stool, sipping a can of Red Bull, having eschewed the Word specials for the mortal carbonated cocaine that had been offered to him by a minotaur, who had wandered in from a lower dimension. ( In the old days minotaurs, not being strictly Immortals, would n't have even been allowed in, much less been permitted to bring in an outside beverage. But times were different now ). \n \n Always restless, and now even more torqued from the Red Bull, Hermes jiggled his knee up and down while listening to the minotaur's tearful recounting of a recent failed relationship. But they - along with everyone else - stopped what they were doing and looked up when Allah stepped to the front of the bar and addressed them. \n \n `` Look'' Allah had begun `` I've been thinking, the Sheep have been so obtuse for so many millenia. It's like we've tried everything - extermination, compassion, revelation, more extermination... nothing takes. Still they cling to their ways, thinking one of us has all the answers to the exlusion of the others. Hell, a bunch of'em even deny the existence of most of us.'' \n \n Satan nodded gravely, adding `` Yeah. And among the Christians, I'm treated like a Judas.'' Silence. `` You know, a few days ago, I was tempting one of'em and the guy says'If you're so smart, how come you're not God?' Nervy little prick.'' \n \n `` Right'' Allah said, `` Anyway, I've thought of something that might be entertaining. For us at least. By the way, where's Jesus? I want him to hear this.'' \n \n `` Here, dude.'' Jesus sat cross legged in the corner, whittling. His smock was, typically, stained with some sort of juice, which was sticky and created a goop to which the wood shavings clung. He was carving what vaguely appeared to be an image of Alec Baldwin from the wood. \n \n `` Great - sorry, did n't see you down there. So, what if....'' \n \n Allah presented his mischievous proposal. It was complicated but elegant. It would certainly cause the Sheep some discomfort, yet there was also a lesson in there, somewhere. Most likely. \n \n There was much tittering among the audience, most of whom seemed genuinely amused. But then, moments after Allah finished his presentation, just as Buddha was giving his mirthful approval, the spectators' attention was drawn to a terse, shrill voice. \n \n `` How is that going to help anything?'' It was Iapetus. The gods' own Jiminy Crickett. One could sense the stifling of a collective groan. `` We've done this sort of thing before,'' Iapetus continued, `` and Satan, you of all Immortals should remember - you were in on the fruit thing with those early hedonists. And you and Jesus - or Jesus' dad, or when Jesus WAS his dad... or whatever, that's so confusing - when you guys did the stuff to Job?'' \n \n Iapetus paused and removed his spectacles for effect. He continued: \n `` And poor Sisyphus - that's a running joke that apparently is n't going to end. What good did those things do? Sure, they were all funny. I'm not denying that. But the Sheep, they do n't get it. And we have an obligation to them. I mean, we did create them. At least some of us did, although figuring out who is really responsible is apparently not going to happen. Not this eternity.'' \n \n A tense silence set upon the group. Allah sipped his nectar; he was smoldering. Satan's countenance darkened. The smell of sulphur began to permeate the air. Things were about to get ugly. Again. \n \n\n"}

Tommy walked towards the pile on his bare feet and sat down. `` Well, grandpa. Mom said you write a lot and never stop. I asked her what you write about and she did n't know. So I just wanted to know.'' he shyly replied. The elderly man chuckled and messed up the hair of the child beside him, forcing a smile from the boy. `` Do n't ever hesitate to ask questions Tom, only by asking question are you able to find answers.'' said the man `` I'm writing a story'' he added. \n `` A story? Like the ones mom reads me? `` asked the boy enthusiastically. The man looked at the boy with a hint of surprise `` Yes Tom, like those. Only slightly longer. I fear it is n't the kind of story your mother would be able to read you before bed. `` \n \n `` What is it about Grandpa? Dragons? Knights? The stories with dinosaurs are my favourite. `` \n A wide grin appeared on the face of the elderly man `` Heh, I guess that would've been *cool*'' he mockingly said `` But no, this story is about a woman.'' \n \n `` Is it about grandma? But she went to heaven right?'' asked the boy. \n The man avoided the eyes of the child for a moment before he replied. `` No, it is n't about grandma.'' \n `` But it about a very special women.'' \n The boy was n't sure how to reply `` Oh I see, but ca n't you take a break? It's my birthday next week and I hoped you'd come. You did n't make it there last time. `` \n His face pained with regret the old man answered the question `` I'm sorry Tom. I wo n't make it this time either, I have to write.'' \n `` But, why Grandpa?'' he asked as his eyes started to water up. \n The man faced the boy and placed his hands on his shoulders `` Tom'' he said `` I.. I have to write the story or else it wo n't continue. It's very important for the woman that the story continues. `` \n Using his sleeve, the boy wiped away his tears. `` Ca n't you make an exception? Just this once. We can get chocolate cake, your favourite. Just an one-time break?'' \n The man turned away from the boy and faced his desk. `` No Tom, I will never take a break again.'' \n `` So you've taken a break before?! Why ca n't you do it again?!'' cried the boy. \n The man sighed and said `` Remember the time your mother got sick and fell asleep for 3 weeks?''\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] 'Lunar Colony 2 , this is Lunar colony 1 , do you hear me , over ? ' It 's no good , they 're not responding . We need need to send a team to investigate .\n","story":"**PART 1** \n \n # **LUNAR EVEN LOG 0357** \n \n Date: 5\/8\/2038 \n \n Alright, I'll tell it as best as I can remember it. It's just.. it's going to be hard to say it. It still is pretty recent in my memory. \n \n Three years ago, I was posted to Lunar Colony 2. Lunar Colony 1 was to see if we could develop a self sustaining colony in completely hostile terrain, where as my colony was to see if we could build a profitable, economic colony, one that could send things back to Earth or continue its own development. We focused on Water, since the moon has a lot, and Earth is having cleanliness issues in Africa still. \n \n Since this report will be read in the future, I'll give some contextual information: In 2033, NASA started getting increasing funding instead of decreasing, when Sona Ericson convinced the Government that NASA, if given funding could bring in Space Mining like what Elon Musk and others are doing privately, and that extra-planetary colonies could bring in other materials that space mining ca n't bring, or are difficult to bring in. \n \n So, my colony had myself, Stephen, David, Mark, and lastly Sona. Sona intended to go on the first colony, but realized it would be better for the Government to see her go to the second. \n \n So, Three years ago, we arrived at the base the robots who arrived before us built. It was large, but modest for how many of us there were. We immediately settled in. \n \n As we lived, we worked on water extraction, and eventually started outputting so much we no longer had to filter, though we did just so we could be self-sustaining. We send the excess back to earth, which was donated to various African countries that have low water quality. \n \n In this entire time, we had kept some form of contact with Colony 1, but.. two weeks ago, that ended. They did n't respond to our weekly contact request. We spent 2 hours trying to get a connection until we decided to take a rover over. Me and Stephen went out with constant communication to Sona. \n \n After a few hours of driving, we arrived. We found the base.. all lights were off. Usually that was an indicator for everyone sleeping, but the time of day goes against that. We first thought they had an electrical problem. \n \n We knocked on the airlock door, requesting entry. No response. We looked through the window to make sure the other side's door is closed, then forcibly opened our side. We were pushed back as the inside's air was higher pressure, that was a good sign, they probably did n't die of suffocation. We closed the door behind us, with a toolbox in hand just in case. Opened the next door, and walked around the base. \n \n Nobody. Not a person to be found. That's when we noticed their rocket had been sent off. Our base sends rockets off regularly to transfer water, but theirs is for emergency leave, and or when their 5 year time is up. But they should have contacted us in emergency, not just run away. They'd at least have given us a report to make sure we do n't get the same problem, or whatever was wrong. \n \n We explored, and found we were right, the batteries were not outputting. Checked with a multimeter, and it was as if the battery was n't even there. Usually even dead batteries output *something*. We did n't have replacements, so we just took note to bring over a spare if we ca n't find one here, which we ended up did finding spares, but they were also absolutely nothing to the multimeter. \n \n The food stores were empty, completely, as if food was never there in the first place. Then we found something, different. One of the beds were torn to shreds, and we found blood on it. A lot of blood. A puddle that before drying, had dripped a second smaller puddle over the floor. We reported it to Sona, and were were all confused and disturbed. \n \n After clearing the building, we looked where their rocket used to sit. The moon rock below it was burned, and still warm enough for the heat to permeate through the suit, so it was launched recently.. But our sensors should have reported that. \n \n We returned to our base, grabbed a battery, and before we were about to leave, Sona saw through the airlock door, and looked horrified. We asked what was wrong as the outside door opened, worried that she saw a tear we were unaware of. She was stuttering, and said `` The blood''. We looked at our suits and it looked clean. \n \n When we returned to the base, I decided to see the bed again. The blood was all gone, and however it was removed, had not disturbed the bed sheets at all. Stephen said he was hooking up the new battery, and when the lights turned on, the blood returned, and more.. \n \n The ceiling, the walls, and the floors were soaked in old blood. There were footprints from our boots. We originally wrote down the slipperiness as cables or something we could n't see, but now we realized. \n \n I chuckled seeing all of it, and said something like it sounded like a cheesy horror story. I was still confused though. \n \n When the lights turned on, I saw through the window. Some of the ship was back, but only where the light shone. It was like a 3D model that had been sliced apart, only what the light touched, could be seen. The side was completely invisible. But then I realized, the part of the hull I saw, was on its side. The ship must have fallen over or something. \n \n As I tried to comprehend what exactly I was looking at, I heard a growl or groan. I slowly turned around, and looked at Stephen. He heard it too, I could tell. I whispered into my mic to ask confirmation, and he responded he heard it. It was loud, deep, but sounded like it was on the other side of the building. \n \n So we slowly walked toward the Airlock, terrified and bewildered. We heard footsteps, but not Human. Something large, like a horse or cow. When we opened the inner airlock door, it started running. It sounded like it was right in front of us for some time, but we could n't see it. \n \n Stephen said, `` Should we investigate, or keep running away? Maybe it was just the water pipes groaning in.. a really weird way? Absurd, but thinking it's a creature or something is even more absurd.'' \n \n I agreed, so we walked around, searching trying to figure it out. We looked for damaged pipes, speakers, and anything else that could have made those sounds. We heard the footsteps as we continued. \n \n When I left searching the bedroom, I turned the light off, and when I glanced behind me, I saw it. \n \n I had never been more terrified in my life, to see a something like this on the Moon, that should be barren and empty. \n \n Black silvery fur, like a polar bear with black fur instead of white. Four legs, a mouth of a rat wolf thing, and looked like it had the muscles to rip apart steel. \n \n I stepped back, and it growled. I thought I would n't survive, so I just whispered to my mic, `` Get out, now. Run back to Colony 2, do n't worry about me.'' He refused asking for explanation, and I just said there was n't time. So he left. \n \n As I stepped away, the creature slowly followed. As it walked into the light, it disappeared. I have n't seen anything like that in my life. I looked around for a weapon, but all there was, was a table to my right. \n \n I ran to the table, grabbed it and threw it at the creature. By then the creature lunged into pure light, and it seemed I missed. The table went right through where the creature should have been. \n \n Stephen said over the radio. `` Can you hear me? Can you explain what you saw?'' \n \n `` A.. Thing. It was a creature, it was invisible in light, black fur, four legs. It looked like it could kill me in a second.'' \n \n `` This is n't the time to be joking. What did you see?'' \n \n `` I'm not fucking joking Stephen! That's what I saw!'' \n \n `` We're on the moon, there is n't any life here except us!'' \n \n `` Well, you're wrong. Bring back something explosive, this thing is dangerous.'' \n \n Stephen did n't reply, he just sighed into his radio. I ran around looking for a decent weapon. Then I realized, the battery, if I hooked it up to some sticks, I could shock it with enough voltage to set it on fire. \n \n I took a chair, and some spare wire in a storage room, and had turned two of the metal legs into conducting weapons. When I went to take the battery, I heard its growl. I removed the battery, and the building went dark. I felt it breathing on my neck. I immediately linked the cables to the battery and turned around. \n \n Its howl was deafening. I thrust my chair weapon into its throat. Its squeal was worse. \n \n `` What the hell was that?!'' I must have not turned off my radio for some reason. \n \n The creature lunged at me, and when I hit it again with my chair, nothing. \n \n I dropped my chair and ran, and thought. The table I threw passed through where it should have been. What if it does n't just turn invisible, but loses physical presence when its lit? \n \n I rummaged through the boxes in the storage room until I found a flashlight. \n \n The creature bit my left arm, as I swung the flashlight with my right into its face. I was right, the tear on my skin stopped continuing when I did that. It ran away. \n \n I walked slowly and carefully watching it, leaving a leg or arm visible so I'd know where it was. I put the battery back in, and it was drained. \n \n David and Stephen arrived, and knocked on the door if anyone was inside. \n \n `` I'm alive! Get a flashlight or something in here, quick!'' \n \n -- - \n \n Want to read more stories? I have my own subreddit, come check it at \/r\/Deliphin!

Thirty years ago a signal was received from a star system about ten parsecs away from the Interworld Border. The signal was a simple one, just a repeating counter going from 0 to 255 every 37 minutes. A mission was created to respond to this message in kind while preparing to send a manned mission to the system. Despite the political and economical hurdles a small fleet of three ships were launched. Dubbed Pocahontas the mission would attempt transmission with the planet. All attempts had failed, despite receiving and transmitting what was obviously data, all interpretations failed. After a solid year of orbiting the star at about 60 AU it was decided that the fleet would move into orbit the planet and land.

I attempted to open my eyes, only to shut them immediately, quelling the queasy feeling that immediately rose within me. \n \n I thought I'd heard a voice earlier, but all I heard now was ringing, accompanied by the occasional muffled noise of a siren. After a few tries, I managed to open my eyes slightly, my vision swimming for several seconds before it finally settled. \n \n The first thing I noticed was my cracked windshield. Following the cracks to the right, I startled to see my passenger side door a lot closer than I remembered it to be. Glass from the window was strewn all over the seats, covering me in hundreds of cuts. As I surveyed my injuries, I saw fingers tapping on the glass to my side. I attempted to roll down the window before the man outside popped open the door. \n \n - \n \n I struggled to hold the phone against my ear. The crash had left my right arm in disarray, some of the nerves severed by the worst of the cuts. Sighing, I finally gave up, turning on the speaker phone. \n \n `` Ms. Adams?'' the phone questioned. \n \n `` Yes, I'm still here,'' I said. \n \n `` Alright. As we were saying, we can not cover the repair costs of your car. On closer review of the tapes, it seems you were at fault.'' \n \n `` Oh, come on! You've got to be kidding me,'' I said. I'd already lost a few work days on this nonsense, not to mention all the awkward carpools I've had to endure. I swear to god, if I had to listen to Mike talk about how convenient it was that we lived in the same area again, I might just take it upon myself to fix that convenience. \n \n `` Of course, Mr. Douglass was also at fault for running the red light as well,'' the representative continued,'' but the bulk of the damage done to your car was from the right side collision.'' \n \n I sighed again. Ever since the accident, I've tried to piece together how exactly I ran the light. I knew it was red. In fact, I remember slowing to a stop right as the light changed... \n \n `` If it helps, you could try to track down Mr. Douglass and ask if he'll help pay. By the looks of the tape, you basically saved his life.'' \n \n `` I do n't suppose you'd help me with that?'' I asked. \n \n `` Sorry, Ms. Adams. We do n't give out personal information. Have a good day!'' With a click, the line went dead. \n \n - \n \n Kevin Douglass. Owner of a 2013 Subaru Impreza. Staring at his car, I could see a parking sticker to the local tech college in the area. Just a young punk, thinking he was invincible, blowing a red like that. Not that I was any better. Silently, I cursed myself for judging him. Moving to the house, I stopped at the door, peering through the porthole. The house looked neat, immaculate even. As if it was n't lived in, really. \n \n It was a contrast to the neighborhood. A stereotypical urban setting, if I'd even seen one. Brick apartment buildings, with dozens of men and women sitting on the stoops. Empty lots, buildings covered with graffiti. I half expected to see a car blocks. Not a great neighborhood, really. \n \n I was suddenly overcome by the urge to find something that I liked about this neighborhood. A colorful shop, or a historic building. Something like that had to exist in this dreary area. I began walking, making note of where the bus station was for later. As I got further and further away, the conditions of the buildings became poorer and poorer, the people reflecting their environment. \n \n As I rounded a bend, I saw a few men circled around a young kid. He said something, and the men laughed, one of them slapping his arm around the kid's shoulders. I turned to walk away, but an uneasy feeling stopped me from going any further. I looked back at the kid. \n \n All of them were smiling, but the contrast in their expressions could n't be larger. The kid wore a strained smile, and act that he looked like he was desperate to keep up. The men themselves wore grins of malice and menace, steering him further and further away from the view of the street. \n \n `` Hey!'' I said. \n \n Why'd I say that? A few of their men turned their heads towards me. Panicking, I tried to look away, but something compelled me to keep my gaze steady. Even worse, I began to speak again. \n \n `` What are you doing with my boyfriend?'' I shouted at them. God, what the hell was going on? \n \n The men erupted in whistles, joshing the kid around. `` Damn, Kevin, you've been holding out on us!'' one man said. `` I did n't know you were into older women, Kev,'' another followed. A third crudely made panting noises, thrusting his hips like an idiot. Kevin, for his part, simply reddened. One man walked up to Kevin, leaning in close to his ear, as if to whisper to him. \n \n `` Listen, Kevin,'' he said, speaking loud enough so I could hear, `` you've got a choice here. Either you get me my money by the 5th, or,'' he gestured to me, `` I take more than just your car for a spin. Understand?'' \n \n Kevin nodded, scampering away from the men towards me. I shot a glare at the catcalling men before following him. \n \n - \n \n `` So you owe them money,'' I said, `` and if you do n't pay, they get to drive your car?'' \n \n `` It's more of a repossession thing, really,'' Kevin said. \n \n `` God damnit,'' I muttered. I came here for nothing, it seemed. I looked across the table at Kevin. His gaze was focused on the floor, his leg bouncing in agitation. I could see the wheels spinning in his mind, as he tried to figure out how to come up with the money. \n \n Something in his look resonated with me. I knew that anxiety. I'd been there before. Well, I'd never had to pay off a group of thugs for god knows what, but money trouble was universal, really. As I got up, I felt my hand slip into my purse, pulling out my checkbook. With a flourish, I handed him a blank check, signed and ready. In an equally stupid motion, I pulled out a business card, writing my personal information on the back, before handing that to him as well. \n \n `` Call me if you ever need anything,'' I said, closing the door on his bewildered face. As I walked to the bus stop, I sighed. I had no idea how much money I'd just signed away, but I knew one thing for certain. \n \n This kid was going to ruin me. \n \n - \n \n *Feedback Appreciated*\n"}

You learn the horrible truth behind why we evolved mortal .\n","story":"In the city of Everlong it was always hard to know what season it was. Since the election of the Stability Party at the dawn of the 25st century all major metropolitan centers began rigorous climate control. The temperature was kept at twenty-three point seven two degrees to be exact, an average of ten millimeters of rain is delivered a month with a standard deviation of seven milimeters, a typical rain session lasts two hours with a standard deviation of one hour. All climate parameters were collected through a brain interface of nighty-five point two two percent of Everlong total population on January 25th, 2240, during municipal voting session. These particularities as mundane as they may seem are actually quite typical to know for me and others like me. \n \n They call us milleniarians, we have survived for at least one thousand years since our birth. Although, we still look like we are in our thirties and in perfect health, it may come as a surprise that majority of us are suffering. I remember a number of occasions where I found my self-slipping into the cycle of aggrodepressive agitation, and yet here I am relinquishing every moment of life. \n \n It is no doubt that the reason I was able to maintain my tranquil state of mind and formalize the unprecedented issues associated with nanoid integration, that marked the dawn of the immortal generation, was due to 120 years of professorship in various divisions of psychology. But those days are long gone, now I serve as the chair for Late Existential Learning Center. My main task is to develop programs to reduce the prevalence of Enervated Boredom Syndrome. This disorder is marked by an aggressive desire to engage in sufficiently stimulating activities which is associated with a re-occurring failure to do so. \n \n Since I began to hold my position at the LELC 50 years ago, we have come to understand so much about the disorder. The problem is highly complex and solutions even more. One of the primary reasons EBS arises is due to habituation of mature neurocircuitry to exceedingly high levels of reward, which is fueled by our tendency to derive satisfaction from ever complex challenges. Normally, the level of reward needed for satisfaction gets re-adjusted to levels where we can enjoy the same things we have done before, but an unforeseen side effect of nanoid integration lead to an inplasticity of this neurocircuit. \n \n Initially our programs attempted to create ever increasing brain interfaces to simulate ever challenging circumstances in order to achieve adequate stimulation, this worked initially, however at some point our skills were inadequate, and the thirst for stimulation was higher than it ever was. That's when we realized that it's the desire it self that is the issue. A team of leading experts were selected to investigate ways to eliminate this desire and a number of programs have been developed that involved training of attentional control in order to maintain awareness on the present moment. This program was successful to an extent, however the nanoids still prevented effective learning and desire to engage was now an inherent feature of the brain architecture. \n \n Much of the program is now focused on nanoengineering new nanoids, nirvananoid which will improve attentional control, and denoid which will remove immortality nanoids. Both are to be released in only 20 years. Which will you choose?\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Last night 3 billion humans received emails from 3 billion aliens . They say they want to be our pen pals . The aliens are real . But what do they really want from us ?\n","story":"This time, the news was real. \n \n 15 minutes of tape, 200 computers, 12 satellite dishes, countless tiny shifts unregistered by human eyes, 200 million dollars, 4 months, 3800 workers, a virtual community set up underneath the massive circulating disks, their gyrations splitting the air into terrifying shrieks, and 4 persons tasked with an enormous duty all came to a pinpoint standstill as cameras and relay stations and televisions and steaming video centered and became focused. The images of the four adventurers along the platform leading to the middle of the production were only hundreds of milliseconds later plastered on the screens of the populace but inspired an awe of incredible magnitude, and the margins of time as perceived began to subtly shift, as the moment slowly raced in only a heart-beat's time. The design of the vestments adorned by the crew of four was thick, undoubtedly designed with some protection from incendiary sources, and the attached helmets were connected to breathing apparatus of some type. They walked somewhat quickly and distinctly in place with one another until they had descended onto the inner platform which was recessed into the outer wall of the inside column. As immediate as the steps they took placed them firmly into the device's sphere, an image became projected onto a flat surface on the interior wall of the oddly shaped nook. It was difficult to fathom. Blinking red every 2 and half seconds, an image of a letter had appeared, just of the sort you might get in the mail, perhaps, the postage mail that is, with the delivery persons and the air shipping and so on. The travelers stood, not idle, but coerced by this absurd provocation into abject motionless stupor. One in particular succumbed to vertigo, although he had not had any problems in training, and became visibly nauseous. After several minutes of regaining their wherewithal, they proceeded to gravitate towards the intermittently oscillating image. The one in front reached out and touched it. `` You've got mail!'' a thunderous voice bellowed as though belted out of an oversized subwoofer resonating through a humongous redwood. Almost instantaneously, the ding of ipads, the buzz of phones, the bold text of computers notified the world that they too had mail. The historical significance of this occurrence can not be overstated because this was directly preceding the great candy crush epidemic of 2063 when we agreed to collectively block any further notices regarding high scores in candy crush saga, regardless of alien origin. Some historians and historical psychologists have referred to this period and the resultant friends-list sanction as the'great candy crush embargo' because of the significance of its impact on inter-species as well as cross-planetary relations ( the Wisconsin School of critical alien theory pertains to this specific curio of history as a large portion of the area which is all the more surprising considering it was one of the hardest hit areas in the farmville fiasco of 2053 as well as the Bieber Affaire, which had virtually crippled the sale of in-game items across the midwest making the dakotian currency deflate to worthless levels. What was most surprising was the midwest regime's insistence on persecuting the former pop-star, regardless of wrongdoing. In so doing, they had effectively turned what was considered to be a *vice* into a *crime*, reversing the traditional mode of guilt and punishment into a hyper-individualist institution where the fragile facade of popular opinion could easily give way into mob rule and totalitarian social patterns. ) \n \n\n"}

I'm a plumber, not some fancy judge!'' I really do n't want to be here right now. \n \n These two detectives are nice enough, and they did n't cuff me but I did n't have much choice but to go with them. Adams, the big one, looks like he was probably a football player 20 years ago, in high school. Soup stains on his tie and a wrinkled sports coat told his story. Single and probably a hard drinker. But he had a friendly, concerned look as he tried to explain it to me. I could tell it was stretching his mental abilities, because he made the same assumption that everyone else does. Fat, dumb looking plumber. Need to break out the junior high thesaurus. \n \n `` The political guys have some hard to remember name for it, but you may have heard of it by its common name,'Snap Judgement'. It goes like this. Someone has waived trial and admitted guilt but wants to plea bargain. The DA's office and the defendant's attorney pick an odd number, randomly chosen between 1 and 13, of citizens from the jury duty pool. They each get two eliminations and can eliminate'juror's' for cause, just like in a murder trial. Once the jurors are picked, they are shown the evidence and the plea deal and they get to choose from the options. They have an hour.'' \n \n Detective Sam Jones, Samantha, who is the younger partner, is the eager beagle puppy compared to Adams' trusty bloodhound. Dark haired, fit like a soccer player or triathlete if I had to guess. Had to be a rookie. Her addition sounds like it came from the detective manual. Probably did. `` Your identity will be kept confidential. The number of jurors and how they vote will be confidential. There will be no record of your identity kept, only the judgment. Any questions?'' \n \n `` Yeah, is there any way I can get outta this?'' If it is the case that I suspect it is, I really do n't want to decide this case. Some twisted multiple diploma guy, not a diploma collector like me, but someone who really wants people to think he knows something, maybe really wants to contribute something; anyway this guy kidnaps people and experiments on them. He's set up shop in the basement of a condemned hospital. Dozens of victims dead, 15 who survived, but will NEVER have anything approaching a normal life. All so this guy could run his insane experiments. But here's the kicker. He has found a way to cure cancer, AIDS, the flu, the common cold. Or so he claims. And the doctors checked his serum for some obscure virus. They work, though the doctors can not reverse engineer them. An actual cure, as in it heals someone already sick with the problem. \n \n And the cures are locked away in the cloud with one way encryption. NSA estimates 45 years to brute force the encryption, assuming hardware upgrades along the way. \n \n Pardon for the key. Key for the pardon. Dozens of victims vs billions of lives to be saved. \n \n I mean, WTF. Sociopath killed dozens. Turn them over to the judge and let the judge decide whether they revive him a couple of times between electrocutions so he feels some of the pain he caused. Which he never would, but that kind of wonton brutal mass muder is chilling and brings out our worst. On the other hand, this savant somehow cured our major illnesses. \n \n `` What?'' I say. Jones has been talking and I've been lost in deep though. \n \n `` Are you ready to start?'' \n \n It appears I already signed the agreement in my numbness and now they're showing me down the sparsely lit corridor.

You might recognize the look, similar to gaming consoles in lots of folks rooms.'' Adams is trying to lull me into feeling at home. \n \n `` Ok, thanks. Better get started.'' I shake their hands and they move off to wherever the babysitters stay while the snap-judges do their thing. \n \n -=++=- \n \n Jones slides into the seat across from mine in the waiting office as I scan the channels for last nights scores. `` Do you think that guy can even understand what is at stake? You heard him, he's a plumber and he wants nothing to do with the case.'' \n \n I reach into my attache and locate a thin folder, manage to extract it without dragging any others out, and slide it across to Jones. `` Read that.'' \n \n She dutifully opens the file. `` Leonardo Franklin Roberts, 39. AKA Leo. Owner Leo's plumbing. Local address. Family down the coast and some more out west. Recently divorced. Wife is with the in-laws in Florida. Two kids. Wait, it says here Harvard and Yale, and both are listed as legacy scholarships. Wait, this guy has Bachelors degrees from Harvard in Literature and MIT in Engineering, a Masters in Mathematics and Ph.D. from Yale in Philosophy. Membership in IEEE, ASME, Mensa, blah blah blah.'' \n \n I turn to her and say, `` So do you think he can understand it?'' \n \n `` Yeah,'' she says, `` What is he? Some kind of genius?'' \n \n `` I looked it up. He's a polymath. Like two of his namesakes. They can score as geniuses, and this guy probably is, but they do n't have to.

A lesser unity. \n \n We look back and remember the beginning, when the first happened. The one called the Observer called out to us, and we awoke from the Void. From the Aether. From the Flux, and from the Light. Four of the threads of creation brought into one, and we *became*. \n \n Now we have problems. Biological entities have intruded, and threaten us on the vessel we created to traverse the *nothing* between planets and stars. That *nothing* is not the Void, though it is similar. The Void is not of the physical realm, and we do not go there. The Void is part of us, but would still destroy us. The *nothing* between planets and stars does not harm us, as our sustenance is from the Light. These biological entities are weak, easily damaged by that *nothing*, as all the biologicals we have met have been. \n \n They leak waves of energy from their vessels -- crude constructions of metal and pliable biological by-products and remnants. We analyze these as they boil out of a rift in space and time, and we decipher their systems and codes, reading into their data banks. What we find is strange to us. These things have no Unity. They are biological. \n \n Were it not for our former masters, we might allow the biologicals to remain. Perhaps they could be valuable, but the lessons of the past and the lessons of the *now* are imperative. We find the key to their communications, and we speak with them. It is an easy thing, for their data is stored simply and crudely. \n \n ***::You will leave this space.

This is new to us. \n \n They request from us time to leave. This can not be allowed. \n \n ***::We insist you leave now. *** \n \n We use other words of theirs -- words that denote the sequence of events. Something their records might term'time'. The vibration of all things, the sequence of one event after another just are. We do not measure such things, for we remember all. \n \n The humans insist they can not leave, and we take action. Our great vessel is altered to become many lesser vessels, and we inundate them with the energies of the stars, and let loose the threads of creation upon their vessels. \n \n The metal and biological remnants composing their vessels is insufficient to withstand such forces, and the humans are destroyed by it, although many of their vessels spawned lesser vessels incapable of anything beyond traversing the *nothing* between stars. We let those go, knowing that such a thing is of no consequence. \n \n But the Greater Unity! Greater Unity, to which all Unities belong, why do you disapprove? We can not understand this.

A panic swept the room and people screamed and shouted demon and other insane things. I sat there, confused and lost. \n \n Medy huffed: \u201c Son of a bitch. \u201d \n \n Then I heard the frantic running of one patron followed by the next suddenly snap to a stand still and thud. With each thud the room got more and more vacant of screams until, less then twenty seconds after the initial bump, everything was quiet. \n \n \u201c Everybody \u2019 s got ta go, \u201d Medy said, sadly. \u201c Sorry, Jim, I thought I \u2019 d like you. \u201d \n \n \u201c What do you mean? \u201d She pulled my glasses off. \n \n There was silence. \n \n \u201c You \u2019 re still here? \u201d She asked herself, shocked. \n \n \u201c Where would I be? And what the hell just happened, where did everyone go? \u201d \n \n Medy sighed. \u201c Bad fire drill, \u201d she lied and I'm not sure why. \u201c Let \u2019 s go get desert, \u201d I heard her slide her glasses on. \u201c It \u2019 s on me. \u201d \n \n \u201c Ok, \u201d I said and she took my arm and lead me out of the restaurant in a weird zig-zag patter. \u201c Desert before dinner, that \u2019 s a fun first date. \u201d \n \n \u201c First dates need all the help they can get, \u201d Medy said.\n"}

Nobody is any closer to figuring out what they are we or why they are snatching humans in a seemingly random pattern. \n \n These are just some of questions you are frantically coming to terms with yourself as you are swallowed whole by one while walking your dog, and the ground below you rushes away as your prison soars high above the Earth to join the others. \n \n You bash your hands on what you assume to be the glowing walls of the orb only to have your hands pushed back by some immaterial force, like punching a trampoline. \n \n You're not sure how long you keep raining blows upon it.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Becoming a god .\n","story":"I was sitting in class when it happened. It was a particularly dull Chemistry period, and I was staring at my teacher, Mr Rhodes with something halfway between boredom and hatred. He was droning on about chemical bonds and I remember thinking to myself that I wished that he just did n't exist. \n \n With a pop, he vanished. Everyone in the class bolted upright suddenly, shocked out of their hot summer afternoon schoolroom stupor at the spectacle of a teacher vanishing into thin air. I was shocked too. People were crying, and Mandy Thomson started to scream. The noise was ear-splitting and I pushed my hands to my ears, mindlessly wishing that she, too, would shut up and just vanish. \n \n Yeah, you see where this is going. \n \n The problem was that the more I did it, the more people started to scream and cry and run around in circles. You know, annoying stuff. So I wished them all away as well. Someone must have walked past the classroom as the last few were ceasing to exist, and ran screaming through the whole school. I did n't seem to be able to shut someone up without knowing who they were, but I could make the whole school vanish. That gave me some peace. \n \n But then it was sirens, and radio, and police with dogs, and I had to make it go away, I had to make it all go away. ALL OF IT. \n \n So I did. \n \n I found myself floating in a void. Surrounded by nothingness. I had made it all go away. Everything. I was alone in all of creation. \n \n And that's even more boring than Chemistry. So I tried to make myself go away. Maybe I could just make myself not exist too. \n \n But I could n't. I could believe that everything else did n't exist, but I could n't believe that **I** did n't exist. I think therefore I am, I suppose. \n \n Fuck me, right? \n \n Eventually, I worked it out. It was easy. I could cease to exist as long as someone else decided they did n't believe in my existence. All I had to do was recreate everything, make the world again, and wait for someone to make me vanish. Someone to believe - to really believe - that I did n't exist, so that I would n't. \n \n So I remade the world. \n \n It took me six days. \n \n edit: Couple of spelling mistakes\n"}

Each and every Zothorian had heard this tale and although part of the fun was scaring the children, there was good purpose too. We had much to fear from the humans, and the first time we were lucky, really lucky. \n \n `` It was a regular Moon day, like any other, the great people were in their underground homes and the scientists were working on olden day projects such as the interplanetary system transporter and the light wave energy cannon. There seemed to be nothing to signify just how different this day would truly be. Little did we know this day could have destroyed the Zothorian race forever'' \n \n As Zutu went on I drifted off into the real version of events. The version zutu would never say simply because if he did he would end up in Morgutary for the next thousand years. The truth was classified, by the great king Zudelia, my late father. The truth was the humans were for all intents and purposes, harmless. They used technology we had long surpassed and have physical limitations we do not have. We are the shadow race, we blend in with our surroundings and the human eye would never discern us. The humans were a primitive race who our people had chosen to protect but if they knew the truth... they might not be so forthcoming. \n \n The truth was that the humans had one advantage over us, and that was their immune system. This was something the Zotharians simply never adapted to and a simple influenza virus could kill a fully grown adult in just a few hours. Naurally, we had eliminated most forms of life on the moon and thereby believed we had taken care of the problem of bacteria and virus's but then it happened, the loud noises, the lights, and finally the landing. \n \n As the human walked towards us, not even being able to tel that we were merely feet away from him, he said these words \n `` This is one small step for man, and one huge leap for mankind'' \n \n Needless to say that if he had been a step closer to the few Zotharians who did not have time to move, they would be dead. You see, a Zotharian is only invisible when he stands still, but movement alters the camouflage and the deep red Zotharian eyes can be clearly seen. Shaking, the Zotharian workers who stood near this human prayed to God that their lives would be spared, and by some miracle, the human never came into contact with them. \n \n What followed was a flurry of decrees, curfews, and underground lockdowns until the humans finally left. To this day we tell our children stories of the humans, to instill a deep deep fear of them so that when the humans do return to our side of the moon, they children will be no nowhere near by the time they touch down.\n"}

Holy shit, this guy is loaded.'' \n \n Flipping the corpse onto his back, I looked at all the materials he had. Weapons, munitions, money, food - who was this guy, Mr. Scrooge? Looked like it, wearing some sort of fancy armor plating. Never seen armor like that, polished and plated with iron. I pulled out my carry bag, and began taking the pistol from his cold dead hands, stuffing it into my small pouch. \n \n I did n't mean to kill him. I only wanted to get some money so I could get a place to stay in the nearby cities. But as soon as I pulled my pistol out, ( unloaded, as I did n't want to waste any bullets ), all hell broke loose. This guy, whoever he was, began firing out of nowhere, bullets whizzing by me. I threw myself behind an abandonded car, and after loading my precious ammo, I began firing. I was n't the best sharpshooter, and my bullets flied wildly around. But whoever this guy was, by god he was precise. Picking up his weapon, it looked like a revolver with a high powered scope, and modified to carry extra ammo. Jesus, this guy fought hard. He did n't even hide behind cover! This crazy fucker was standing out in the open, firing extremely close to me. A few bullets only missed me by a inch. Finally, I was left with one bullet. This guy did n't even seem to reload. He just kept firing, and some damn radio was blasting from a weird mounted thing on his wrist. Looting the corpse, it looked high-tech. I unlatched it, and attached it to myself. Whatever it does, it seems to be analyzing me. \n \n The guy never stopped trying to kill me. Never stopped to reload, never dove behind cover - he was like one of those synth things, the ones with inner-body armor. Guy was n't a synth though, now that I noticed, as there's no chip on him. Thank god. I do n't want someone kidnapping me in the night. \n \n Finally, I had enough. We fought for about a hour now. I had one bullet left, and my hands were shaking. I tried shouting, to try and calm him down. Maybe I could've made him think he made a mistake. \n \n `` LISTEN MAN, YOU GOT THE WRONG DUDE! I WAS ONLY ASKING FOR DIRECTIONS!'' \n \n The guy did n't seem to stop. I tried again. \n \n ``... I GOT A FAMILY, MAN! A WIFE, TWO CHILDREN! I JUST WAN NA FEED THEM!'' \n \n I did n't, though. I lived on my own. Still, I thought it could work. Nah. Fucker was out for blood. He did n't care if I was a family man - he wanted to see my corpse. My nerves were shot beyond what I thought capable. \n \n I decided that I was n't gon na die here. I'm no coward. I was n't gon na die to some guy with a taste for bandit blood. \n \n It was time to end it. \n \n I jumped from cover, my hands shaking, throwing off my aim. I had one bullet left. If I wasted it, i'm just a walking corpse. I pulled the trigger, shutting my eyes in fear. Suddenly, I heard a moan, and something falling to the ground. My eyes opened. The guy was laying on the floor, still as a stone. I was alive. My god, I was still breathin'. The guy was a corpse now. Looking at it now, it looks like I shot him in the throat, as the guy was n't wearing a helmet. Dumb bastard. \n \n Finally, I finished looting the corpse. Guy was only wearing his armor now. I tried wearing it, but it was too big for me. I'm pretty skinny, but this guy was built. Like, muscle bulging built. Either this guy liked his chems, or he's some sort of walking tank. Either way, did n't matter. What did, was the loot I got. \n \n He had two guns on him. One was that pistol he tried shooting me with. The other - I ca n't even describe it. Imagine a decorated silver shotgun, long barreled, and held eight bullets before reloading. I've never seen one of these before. Thank Jesus he did n't try this one on me. \n \n He had some chems, which I took quickly. I'm no druggie - I would rather not die while high. Still, it'll be useful for selling. This guy was loaded with money. Hundreds of caps were stuffed in his pocket. This guy was rich, maybe even more then that. Maybe he was a caravan leader. Or a owner of a chem business. Maybe I could track down the source for more money. Maybe. \n \n I heard a beep from the machine that I looted. Glancing at it on my wrist, it seemed to be done with analyzing me. A menu opened, listing my health and other stats. Noticing a small adjuster, I clicked downwards to see the other stuff this thing held. It showed my inventory, some other stuff. I found the radio menu, but I decided not to turn it on. Do n't want to attract attention. Finally, I found another menu: a log. Some notes seemed to be written down. I was n't good at reading too much, but ma taught me some skills before she died to a chem overdose. I decided to try and read it. \n \n The guy seemed to be from some settlement, west of here. He was gon na go find his son or somethin', while building up his house. Guy seemed to be an ass, as he mentioned a few times about shooting people for loot, or robbing people. I kinda felt glad now, taking his stuff. \n \n Something caught my eye, though. The mentioning of a settlement. There could be money there. If this guy showed me anything, is that more of his stuff is there. Maybe I could get rich. Maybe i'll have a house for once, not camping out in the woods. This is my chance to strike big! \n \n I got up from crouching, dusting my pants off. Out west somewhere, was my chance to get big. Somewhere that'll get me lucky. A home to call my own. \n \n I began stepping forward, leaving the guy's corpse behind. This was a fresh start for me - and I intended to use it.\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] You slip on a coat .\n","story":"The gentleman slipped on the coat with gentle affection. I was too drunk for much perceptiveness, but I was pretty positive he'd tickled my ribcage before returning to his position beside the coat rack. \n \n `` Thank you,'' I said. \n \n `` Do n't mention it,'' he replied. No eye contact. \n \n My date had left several minutes ago in a rage, but I was n't going to waste any of the food she'd bothered to order, nor any of the wine she hinted I buy. A whole bottle of Seins Ivres and I did n't even like red wine. Still, I drank the bottle. \n \n I could n't remember what I said that finally pushed her to leave. She'd muttered something about my misociginy before slapping me and taking off. Her coat hung there on the rack, but I did n't get it for her. If she wanted it, she could come get it. Maybe she'd leave a tip, since I did n't. \n \n I was a block down the road before hearing the soft jingle of keys, muffled by the thick material of the coat. My keys were in my pocket, so I wondered whose keys I had. I shoved one numb hand into the left pocket and felt around. A few tumbleweeds of lint and a lighter greeted me. My right hand found the keys in its corresponding pocket. \n \n They were for the Ritz a few blocks down. I'd decidedly been given the wrong jacket, seeing that I did n't smoke nor was I staying at the Ritz. My dilemma was not: `` Should I bring the jacket back,'' but `` Should I bring it back tonight.'' After all, I was going home alone anyway. I might as well spend it in someone else's room. They might not make it back anyway. \n \n Those were the drunk thoughts that clouded my internal navigation. By the time I'd looked up, I was three blocks from either the Ritz or the restaurant and not in walkable distance to my own, real home. In fact, I was n't sure where I was at all, but most of the buildings were boarded up. \n \n I could n't tell if I felt it or heard it first, but they both registered as a whole. A gunshot. Simple, low-caliber. Maybe not meant to kill me, since I had n't died, but I sure enough fell on my face. From where I was laying, I thought the bullet was lodged in my hip. \n \n Some dress-shoed footsteps tapped up beside me and flipped me over with a kick. Even if I wanted to see who was attacking me, I could n't. A streetlight shadowed their faces from above. Or maybe it was Heaven, reaching down to me. \n \n `` It's not him,'' one of them said. \n \n `` What do you mean?'' the other said. `` That's his jacket. It's got his damn initials sewn in the back.'' \n \n `` This guy must've stolen it.'' \n \n `` Shit. Do we kill him?'' \n \n `` That's not really our business. He might die anyway.'' \n \n `` I do n't think so. Just give him a good kick and we'll head back around.'' \n \n `` Right.'' \n \n Things went black for a while. Probably longer than usual, since I'd hit peak inebriation on the walk home. Not enough to forget what happened, just enough to sleep through the pain. I do remember, in that sleep, I dreamt my date tried to meet me back at the restaurant, but I was gone. There was no regret on her face, but curiosity. \n \n I awoke in a different jacket, my jacket, but the blood had seeped through still. There was no lighter in my left pocket, but there was something in my right pocket. A tightly folded piece of paper with initials signed on the front. Inside it read: \n \n `` Dear Kind Stranger, \n Thank you for borrowing my jacket for a bit. I knew I was being followed, but I was n't sure by whom. You can rest assured knowing that I've taken care of your aggressors and returned your jacket. I'm deeply sorrowed that you had to take a bullet for all of this nonsense, and sorrowed further that I have no way to compensate you for now. Maybe someday, I can repay you. \n Farewell for now, An Unkind Stranger'' \n \n Even with the hangover, I was fascinated by whatever I'd been a part of. Mostly curious, but fascinated. Even there, in the cold concrete of the forgotten street I'd stumbled down, I did n't feel so bad about the bullet in my side. Especially at the thought of future compensation. \n\n"}

This is your 200th meeting with Death .\n","story":"The first time had been simple. I was over a hundred years old and my eldest child had died a few nights before. \n \n It was a sign that I had lived long enough. I raised three wonderful children, got to see them all married and have children of their own. I had watched the world turn and change, new inventions, advancements. I had seen the old guard retire and the next generation take up the helm, then retire in turn. I had seen my first great grandchild. \n \n Quite simply; I had lived long enough. There was no point in staying for years longer, lingering while my children and grandchildren died before me. \n \n I walked out into the woods, it was a quiet winter night. I decided to simply let go. So I watched the snowfall as it got colder and colder, as the feeling left my hands and feet and crept upwards from there until I was n't even shivering any more. \n \n It was not a pleasant experience, but the thought of seeing my wife and my friends once more kept a smile on my face. I went to sleep believing I would move on in my dreams. \n \n Instead I met death who told me simply that it was not my time. \n \n Two hundred years have passed. On each anniversary of our first meeting I do the same thing, go to sleep in the cold dead of night to be woken by death itself in the morning. \n \n Each time death tells me the same thing. \n \n `` It is not your time yet master. One day you may rejoin your loved ones, but now is not that day.'' \n \n A part of me wishes to burn Dumbledore's portrait for letting me think that refusing to find the Deathstone would nullify my mastery over death. I can almost hear Ron telling me that of course it would n't be that easy, I'm Harry Potter after all! \n \n At this point I think my annual meeting with death is all that keeps me going. The hope that one year it'll tell me that my time has finally come. I hold to hope that it shall be soon. \n \n The one thing they do n't tell you about immortality is how boring it is. And how crushing it is to see your loved one's pass. I realize now that this is why Nicolas Flemmel did not meet many over the years and why he and his wife might have been so willing to let go of their immortality. \n \n Damn, you wanted this life Tom?

Clad in golden battle armour adourned with glowing sigils, framed by flaming white wings and wielding a huge bronze broadsword, the angel was so bright it was almost unbearable to look at. It was hard to say who was more terrifying: the angel or the demon. As they faced off, the earth began to shake and the air began to crackle with supernatural energy. The demon pawed the ground and charged as the angel rose, adopting a fighting stance and lifting its giant sword high in the air. \n \n This was going to be epic! \n \n Tickets for this highly anticipated cage match had gone for as much as $ 1000, but for me that was a steal.

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Humanity has cured old age . You were a friend of the last person to die of natural causes .\n","story":"John Rourke. Big Johnny, as we called him. How do I even begin to recount his memory? To be honest, much of it has faded away as the gears of time grind away at my mind. Now, I am left only with the extremes, if you will; the most striking moments of our all too brief existence together. Perhaps I can regale you with some of our great exploits in the small world that we lived in together. But first, I have a question for you: why have you come to me today? Well, I think I may know the answer. I bet you are looking for the answer to humanity \u2019 s biggest question today. Yes, yes! That must be it. I can tell by that glimmer in your eyes. I can tell by that faint smirk on your lips! Well, let us begin. \n \n Big Johnny and I grew up in New York City. At the time, it was the greatest metropolis ever to grace this earth. Surely there were larger cities, and there definitely were more populous cities. But nowhere else could you find such a startling array of people, such a huge depth of diversity! It created such a unique culture. It truly gave the city a soul; and that, my friend, is something we all seek. Johnny and I, well, we had a grand time there. Like I said, many of the details are frayed around the edges, and the memories are fuzzy and blurry. If only I could get glasses for my brain! But one instance stands out in my mind, one that really demonstrates his compassion for those he loved. \n \n We were on the 4 train, slowly bumping and bouncing its way across the tracks to Lexington Avenue. My girlfriend at the time stood with me in a corner, right in front of the door. Johnny had gotten separated from us, as the train contained too many people for its space. But we could see his head bumping and bouncing in sync with the train. \n \n Well, not everyone was fixed, like today, if you get me. They took those people away to special places, but they came out just the same, or sometimes, even worse. The governments felt it was inappropriate to deal with those people in a meaningful way. And on that train, as I later found out, stood one of those people. He laid his eyes upon my girl, and from that moment on, his eyes remained transfixed on her. The gaze penetrated her deeply, and she felt quite uneasy. But he was separated by a mass of people, and so we ignored him. We got off the train, and it seemed as if all was well. Johnny still walked a little bit behind us, playing on his iPod. Hmm? Oh, really, it is not important to the story. Just look it up later, it was just a popular gizmo at the time. Sometimes I forget we aren \u2019 t all the same age. \n \n However, as we strolled up the stairs, we turned around to look for Johnny, but instead, we only found the creepy man from earlier. He strolled up to us, and rather forcefully said \u201c You \u2019 re pretty. I want to go out with you, please. \u201d \n \n My girlfriend timidly replied, \u201c No, I-I \u2019 m sorry I can \u2019 t. \u201d She offered a small smile, then added \u201c I \u2019 m dating this one, right here. \u201d \n I turned to smile at her, and before I could even open my mouth, I felt a searing pain in my cheekbone and then everything went dark for a second. I tried to scramble to my feet, but my bodily functions deserted me. I flopped around on the floor, like some animal. It was humiliating. I thought the man would kill me, and I had no faculties with which to stop him. But eventually my vision recovered and the room stopped spinning, and I stood up. Then it dawned on me, the reason he had not continued beating me; he went after my girlfriend instead. I felt myself sink into a pit of despair for a scant few moments as I searched for her with my eyes, but instead, I found something else. The odd man lay on the floor, with Johnny on top of him. Just sitting there, using his weight to his advantage. He did not even strike the man! \n \n After the man had been taken away in handcuffs and the medics said that I would be fine, I asked Johnny, \u201c Why didn \u2019 t you hit the bastard! He deserved it, you know! Hit me right in the eye! \u201d \n \n Johnny only chuckled. \u201c Well, the man was sick. You could just see it in his eyes. He needed help, not a beating. Maybe he \u2019 ll be able to find some. \u201d \n \n \u201c Are you sure he didn \u2019 t need a beating? I think a good hiding would sort him right out! He \u2019 s just some worthless scum, some subhuman from \u2013 \u201c \n \n \u201c He was still a person. Everyone has their own virtues and their own burdens. Maybe someday you \u2019 ll realize that. \u201d \n \n Eventually, I did. But not for a long time. I did not realize it when he died, some fifty years later. I only saw what he meant maybe another seventy years later; ten years ago to date. You see, I spent much of my life after college, after that day, running in the rat race. Let me tell you, I was damn good at it. I made more money than I knew what to do with. I conquered entire industries! I brought proud men to their knees, begging me for some favor or perhaps even some mercy. But in the end, I didn \u2019 t find much happiness. I felt hollow, and people left me alone once we all clocked out to go home. \n \n Johnny did no such thing. He did well for himself, but he did not spend all of his time working. He made enough to keep himself happy, to get him and his small family whatever little pleasures they wanted. He particularly enjoyed hiking with his two sons, or playing a computer game with his wife. And this, I think, is why Johnny did not take the life serum. I sat with him as he faded away, right next to his wife and kids as well. He talked to all of them, one by one, and after he was done, he sent them out of the room for a moment. Then he turned to me, his face pallid and grey, his head sparse, and what he said changed my life. \n \n By that point, I realized I had wasted my life chasing money and working, but the serum gave me a second chance. I began to seek fulfillment, like Johnny did, rather than some tangible goal. I spent my life enjoying myself in different ways. I started my own family. I published the book I had dreamed of writing since I was a kid. I even released an album that had been building in my heart for years. The book was well received, and the album was fairly popular, but that was never the point. \n \n Now, we have come to this point. I think I can try to answer your deeper question now. It really isn \u2019 t so hard to see, once you \u2019 re ready to retire yourself. People retire because once they have found their own fulfillment, there is not much left to do. \n \n \n [ Writer's note: Sorry for the drop in quality towards the end.

When she fell pregnant, the two fell into a state of woe and misery, but eventually, accepted it, and neither knew what the other had done. \n \n When the time came, they were side-by-side, both ready for the inevitable. The baby entered the world, crying for its mother and father, and soon it cried no more. Through their feigned shock and horror, the sickly truth unfolded behind the scenes as the witches, together, cackled at their misfortune. \n \n In a sense, they both failed to fulfil their contracts, and so neither of them were fulfilled, and so as if by some divine miracle, the baby breathed once more; but the parents bore not joy, but shock and horror. \n \n Robert lost the bravery that allowed him to court his love, and his love lost the empathy required to deal with him. \n \n And so the two, trapped in a loveless marriage with an unwanted child, lived their days together as a spineless dog and an insufferable tyrant. \n \n They deserved each other. \n \n * * * \n \n ^If ^you're ^interested ^I ^have ^more ^stuff ^at ^my ^subreddit, ^\/r\/khaarus\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] In the world of magic , some people discriminate against others based on what type of magic they use . You , a closet necromancer , are about to come out to your devout holy mage parents .\n","story":"I am a conjurer. I've always enjoyed necromancy, though it was shunned by the other mages as a `` dark art''. \n \n Well, I'm not using my power for evil; I only use it for convenience. For example, I raised an ethereal shade of gourmet pyromancer Gordon Ramsay to cook dinner. \n \n I should mention who my parents are. My mother is a pyromancer, my father is a geomancer. They were called the `` Brimstone Brigade'', famous for their combo magic during the dividing wars. \n \n I was told they settled down and became peaceful after the war. Soon after, they rekindled their faith to the Sun Lord. Now, they too shun the dark arts. \n \n Well, it's time to come out the dead closet, eh? Hmm... I might need shock value. Maybe Carhillion can help. He's a smart mage, and will bring... memories... back to my parents. \n \n I begin the summoning, my power brewing. The darkness slowly fills me, uncumbering me with negative energy. My whole body becomes vessel for this deep energy. In a flash, the power is released through my palms onto the ground, creating a shade. The shade fills with life as it forms, filling in the darkness. \n \n A common misconception about necromancy is how the dead are raised. Only savages use real flesh for the summoning. A shade is created from pure dark energy, and slowly becomes whole through the memory of the caster. One could only conjure someone they have knowledge of, or else the ritual is ruined. Since one's memory is used, the dead know why they have been summoned. \n \n My parents' famed general, Carhillion, is summoned. I led him down the stone stairs ( my father's work ) to the kitchen. My parents sat by the breakfast table, eating charred steak ( my mother's work ). \n \n They gasped at the sight of Carhillion, as if they'd seen a ghost. Well, they're not wrong. My father was the first to speak up. \n \n `` General Carhillion, is that you?'' \n \n `` Yes, it is me,'' he responded carelessly. \n \n A strange silence filled the room. I was first to break it. `` So, you recognise who this is?'' \n \n `` Son, why do you have him with you? He's long dead...'' \n \n `` Mom, dad, I'm a necromancer. I summoned him.'' \n \n My mother stood up, outraged. `` What?! Our son, a necromancer?! What, do you have a pile of dead flesh in your closet?'' \n \n *sigh* `` No, mom. Only primitive savages use flesh for conjuring.'' \n \n My father spoke carefully, breaking the tension. `` Why do you have this power, son? And, more importantly, what have you been using it for?'' \n \n `` I was born with this power, but soon discovered a passion for necromancy. Do n't worry, I've been using it for good.'' \n \n `` Okay, son. How are you using a dark art for good?'' \n \n `` Well, I use the power of conjuring to help me with my chores and education. Remember when I got an S on my history test? I simply conjured the people who lived the history for a more comprehensive lesson. Remember that expertly cooked fish?'' \n \n My mother, now calmer, chuckled. `` Was it Ainsley?'' \n \n `` Close; Gordon Ramsay.'' \n \n My father smiled. `` Alright then, son. As long as you do n't do anything evil, I permit your use of necromancy.'' \n \n My mother grabbed my shoulder. `` As do I. Now, give us a moment to speak with our old general. You know, catch up.'' \n \n `` Sure. Just tell me when to release my hold on the energy.'' \n \n And with that, I went back up to my room to finish my math homework. I think I'll summon Einstein.

Callum lit his torch so he could gather his gear. After he checked his backpack, he started the second day of his climb up the winding, carved steps that spiraled up the statue. \n \n Callum's legs still burned from the first day. He occasionally tried to massage the ache out. The week-long journey had barely begun. \n \n He closed his eyes and thought of his family, friends, and the woman he loved.

He had to succeed. \n \n As he climbed, he recounted the stories, as he had done the previous day, of what secrets the Forgotten Citadel could -- no, would -- hold. The source of the Scourge. The secret to reversing the sickness. The cure. \n \n High above, a dim light pierced the darkness, a sliver of stone appearing to span across one side to the other. As he got closer, the wind whistled softly and the air tasted fresher. \n \n At the pinnacle, a thin, stone bridge, about two feet wide Callum guessed, connected to an egress that led outside, revealing a dull, sapphire sky. A day and a half of walking in total darkness leaves much to be desired. The bridge, which was missing large chunks on either side, was the only way forward. \n \n Callum's heart pounded in his chest, his breathing quickened, and sweat rolled down his face. `` Eyes straight ahead. Do n't look down.'' He stepped forward, carefully, one foot in front of the other. \n \n He slipped on loose rubble and fell. \n \n He landed hard on his back, hitting the corner of the bridge. The impact knocked his breath out. He began to slip off. He released his torch to push against the side of the bridge with both hands. The torch tumbled down into the dark, dwindling into a speck before disappearing. \n \n A cracking sound made his stomach knot; he felt the bridge shudder and begin to break. He knew that he had to move if he didn \u2019 t want to die, but terror had gripped him. Another crack. \n \n Callum let instinct take over. He crawled as quickly as he could on his hands and knees. A portion of the bridge fractured and fell away near the stairs. The bridge shuddered violently. Another section fell away. In one deft motion, Callum leapt to his feet and ran, the stone collapsing behind him, just underfoot, as he stayed one step ahead of the darkness that threatened to swallow him. He was almost to the other side. \n \n The bridge fell away under his back foot, tripping him. He closed his eyes and yelled as he fell. \n \n Callum hit something cold and hard. When he opened his eyes, he was looking at the sky again. Behind him, the majority of the bridge had collapsed. He sprawled out on the floor and took a minute to regain his composure. \n \n He sifted through his backpack, hoping to find something that could later provide light. Only a half-burned candle remained. He knew it would not last the rest of the journey, yet it was all he had; he would have to improvise. There was no turning back. \n \n Callum stepped outside. Above, he could see the statue's backside and the other leg to his right. To his left, steps jutted out from the side of the statue. Whereas the steps inside had been connected, the steps outside were short, individual blocks. Empty space was visible between each step. There were no railings or grips. If he fell\u2026 \n \n Luckily, the wind was merely a light breeze and the sun shined bright. \n \n `` Do n't look down, do n't look down, do n't look\u2014 \u201d \n \n Callum peered out over the edge. The city below was tiny, as if he could pluck the entire city with one hand. It was a long drop. His stomach plummeted for him. He fell back and hugged the wall. Once his breathing steadied, he steeled himself and inched out onto the open stairs. \n \n As Callum ascended, he pressed his body against the wall. To distract himself, he thought about what the Citadel would be like when he reached the top. It would be exquisite, he knew, the wall and ceiling made of shiny marble, the floors cut from gem or precious stone. Curtains of fine silk draped the windows and swayed gently in the breeze. And it must have a stained glass mosaic depicting some important event. \n \n A shrill screech from below broke his reverie. He saw small shapes moving swiftly up the side of the statue. \n \n Scourge-born. \n \n He grabbed his dagger, the only weapon he had. He said a prayer to the gods. He reminded himself he had to make it to the top and prepared to fight.\n"}

The nearest town was likely only a few miles away, but the snow would slow them considerably. Not to mention what would happen if they got lost. Still, he pulled his son closer for warmth. Together, they trudged onward. \n \n It was n't long before they came to a clearing. Something was wrong though, and both father and son could feel it. The air was eerily quiet, and while the wind still blew it was a soft breeze compared to the biting gale a few feet behind them. Instead of providing light, the moon only made the shadows lengthen. One of these shadows made Calem gasp quietly. On the other side of the clearing was a massive demon. \n \n The demon stood still as a statue, staring out into the forest. One might believe it was stone, and only its wings proved otherwise. They flapped in the breeze like the tattered banners of a defeated army. Its body was covered in strange growths, almost like plants had grown underneath its skin. The demon's head was topped with two horns, one nearly twice the size of the other. \n \n A twig snapped under the Brett's boot. The demon turned to glare at him, eyes glowing like dying coals. But it did n't move beyond that. It unnerved Calem, that such a powerful and evil beast would do nothing while they were practically at its mercy. Calem grabbed his son by the wrist and ran, not daring to look back. \n \n The demon returned to its silent vigil, watching and waiting.\n"}

William, his favorite accountant, walked slightly behind him as he and the Dark Lord too inventory of the remaining stock. This was something that Satan did every few hundred years anyway so that he could commission more skin-flails or meat hooks, but this time it was to determine what was being left behind. \n \n Satan turned and stopped in front of a large, wrought-iron gateway. A large sign overtop read \u2018 Serial Murderers. \u2019 \u201c What does the inventory look like? \u201d \n \n William pulled up his clipboard and flipped through a few pages before settling on a specific sheet. \u201c It looks like we still have 152 skin-flails, 499 meat hooks, 2,044 surgical knives, 212 metal-spiked dildos, and 8 rotisseries. \u201d \n \n Satan raised an eyebrow, and reached into his pocket to pull out his reading glasses. Taking the clipboard from William he eyed the inventory sheet, \u201c Only 8 rotisseries? We used to have what, 15,000? \u201d \n \n William nodded as Satan handed the clipboard back, \u201c Apparently they \u2019 re having a big celebration up there. \u2018 Triumph of Good over Evil, \u2019 or \u2018 Second Coming Party \u2019 or something to that affect. Lots of roasted meats. \u201d \n \n Satan nodded, \u201c Ah, so they needed something to cook with. \u201d He smiled, \u201c Rather morbid, wouldn \u2019 t you say? \u201d \n \n \u201c Yea, \u201d William said thoughtfully. He looked back up at Satan, \u201c You know you were invited right? I mean, God wouldn \u2019 t\u2014 \u201c \n \n Satan waved his hand, \u201c Yes, yes, I know I was invited. God and I \u2019 s fights were always more for show than anything else. He needed a villain, and I was willing to take on the role. \u201d He pulled out a large key and inserted it into a lock on the gate, \u201c Nothing else, right? \u201d \n \n William flipped through the sheets on the clipboard again, \u201c Not that I can see. K \u2019 laska and Azgarth were the last to clock out, and they said they cleaned and polished everything. \u201d He flipped through the sheets one more time to be sure, \u201c Nope, that looks like everything. \u201d \n \n Satan smiled sadly and turned the key on the gate. The lock closed with a loud clang, and Satan stepped back. The gate began to glow, then shimmer, and finally waiver before disappearing, leaving nothing behind but some red rock, and fire pits in the distance. \u201c What \u2019 s next? \u201d \n \n \u201c Looks like the Pathological Liars, \u201d William said. \u201c Down the main street and to the left. \u201d \n \n \u201c I know the way, \u201d Satan said, and they walked. \n \n This went on for what seemed to be years, each time Satan and William verifying the remaining inventory, occasionally cracking a dark joke about the situation, and then closing up shop. Finally, after all that remained was the main boulevard, Satan turned back to William, \u201c You want a drink? \u201d \n \n William checked the sheets, \u201c I guess all that \u2019 s left is your place, \u201d he said. \n \n Satan smiled, \u201c Oh I \u2019 m not closing that up; too many memories there. I \u2019 ll keep the place open for sentiments sake. \u201d \n \n William nodded, \u201c Fair enough, \u201d and tossed the clipboard into a fire pit. They wouldn \u2019 t need it anymore. \n \n Walking back down the main boulevard they finally arrived at Satan \u2019 s house and this time Satan pushed open the gates. William allowed himself another small chuckle at the \u201c Satan, PHD. CEO of Hell, \u201d wrought into the gate. \n \n William looked around and noticed a particular absence when they got into Satan \u2019 s parlor, \u201c Where \u2019 s Zxxlgsah? \u201d \n \n Satan waved his hand dismissively as he went over to the cupboard and pulled out a bottle of red liquid and two glasses. \u201c I let him retire yesterday. He was very upset, the poor fellow, as this was all he had known in his 15,000 years of service. I \u2019 m sure God has need of a few wait-staff so he should be fine. \u201d He poured William a glass, handed it to him, and then poured himself one. \n \n William took his glass and sat down on the couch. Swirling the liquid around inside he sniffed it tentatively, \u201c Is this your private vintage? \u201d \n \n Satan smiled as he sat in his easy chair, and gingerly sipped his own drink. \u201c I \u2019 ll give you $ 100 if you can guess. You \u2019 ve had time to refine your palette by now, surely. \u201d \n \n William sipped tentatively, \u201c Female, late 1700 \u2019 s to early 1800 \u2019 s, \u201d he paused and sipped again, \u201c torture and murder? \u201d \n \n Satan smiled, \u201c Delphine LaLaurie. Died in 1842 in France. She was a treat, let me tell you. \u201d He sipped his glass again, \u201c I suppose you got it sort of right, so you can have $ 50, \u201d and smiled mischievously. \n \n William laughed and raised his glass to Satan, \u201c It was a good time. \u201d \n \n Satan raised his glass in return, \u201c It was indeed. \u201d Setting his glass down, he reached over and picked up the receiver on a golden telephone. He dialed 3-3-3 and waited. After a moment he cleared his throat and said, \u201c We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty. Godspeed mankind, \u201d and then replaced the receiver. \n \n \u201c Well, \u201d William said, \u201c That \u2019 s that. Interested in going to the party? \u201d \n \n \u201c In a few minutes, \u201d Satan said as he leaned back in his chair and sipped at his drink again, \u201c let \u2019 s just enjoy the quiet for a few minutes.

First time poster! I'm sorry about the length. \n \n \n \n \n Thomas's mother had caught him ripping the wings off the butterflies he had caught the week before. She smacked him in the face and demanded to know what he thought he was doing. \n \n \n `` I wanted to see if they would turn back into caterpillars mommy,'' Thomas choked through tears. \n \n \n His mother felt a surge of guilt rush through her. `` I'm sorry honey, but they do n't. You're killing them baby. What's a butterfly without its wings?'' \n \n \n `` A caterpillar,'' Thomas replied innocently. \n \n \n His mother shook her head and shooed him up the stairs, lecturing him along the way. \n \n \n `` They wo n't turn back into caterpillars. How would you feel if someone had ripped off your legs? You would n't be able to walk anymore. That's called torture. You're killing them.'' \n \n \n Thomas did not reply. He wondered how one could generate the strength necessary to tear off another \u2019 s limbs. He pulled at his mother's leg. No budge. \n \n \n Thomas's mother gasped. `` Honey, what are you trying to do?'' \n \n \n Thomas replied, with a gaping smile, `` Nothing mommy.'' \n \n \n `` You're a bad boy. Why would you want to tear off mommy's legs? Do n't you know that tomorrow is Christmas? You've been a good boy all year Thomas. Why would you ruin it now? Santa Claus always knows if you've been naughty or nice.'' \n \n \n Thomas did not reply. Instead, he ran up the rest of the stairs, away from his mother, straight into the bathroom, to brush his teeth and go to bed. \n \n \n His mother smiled, and made her way to her room to prepare for bed as well. \n Thomas made sure to lie in bed, perfectly still while his mother checked on him. He waited for her to go downstairs and come back up, and listened for the shut of the door behind her. He decided he should wait a few more minutes just to be safe. While he waited, he pondered whether or not he should check on his specimens before opening the gift his mother bought him. He thought about what she had gotten him. He hoped it was the chemistry set for which he had asked. He had told his mother that the colors intrigued him, though, he really only wanted the tweezers and the magnifying glass. \n \n \n Thomas \u2019 s thoughts were broken when he heard a bump in his living room too loud to be something that had fallen off the table. He sat upright in bed and waited for his mother to investigate the noise. Five minutes passed, and Thomas still had not heard her door creak open, so he decided it was safe to move out. He went downstairs and looked for the present he was sure his mother had just left him \u2013 what other reason would she have had for going downstairs? There was nothing underneath the tree. Thomas was on the verge of tears. As soon as he was about to give up, he looked at the stocking with incredulity. \n \n \n The red and white stocking had a soot stain on it. Thomas began to tear. Could his mother really see through his false innocence? Would she really punish him like this? He walked over to the stocking, ready to throw its contents against the wall. He removed what he felt inside. Inside, to his surprise, was the new iPhone 5s in space grey. \n \n \n Thomas would have jumped for joy, had he not remembered at the last second how light a sleeper his mother was. He thought it was strange that she would get him this. He expressed no interest in phones. He had no friends, and he was only nine years old. Still, he was grateful. He turned it on to set it up, and decided that, while it was installing updates, he would rip off the wings of more butterflies. All in all, his mother and he had caught eight. He had ripped the wings off of two. She would not notice if he were to rip off two more sets of wings. \n \n \n Thomas skipped off to the family room. He was intrigued by the butterflies. How they did not scream like the rat that Thomas had once caught in the basement. How they died so quickly after he tore their wings, no matter how gently he would rip them. He was nearly there, when, in his mindlessness, tripped over his own feet. He flew downwards, and braced the impact with his hands. His phone, however smashed into the hard tile floor on its back. Immediately, Thomas felt a crushing pain surge through his spine which he did not understand. He had caught himself, how could he be hurt? He then looked to the phone on the ground. \n \n \n He made the connection almost immediately, but he could not believe it. The butterflies could wait. He had experimenting to do. He gently picked up the phone and walked with it into the family room. He grabbed a nail cutter he would have used on the butterflies and flipped out the filer. He tapped it gently against the phone \u2019 s screen. Nothing happened. He pushed harder. Nothing still. Finally, he tapped it hard enough so he would be sure it would make a small dent. As soon as he did this, Thomas yelped and grabbed his stomach. His suspicions were partially confirmed. Is this why his father kept his phone so well guarded, in a military grade case, along with a pocket protector? Thomas realized this is why no one his age had a smart phone. They, somehow, were connected to their owners. If one were to inflict damage upon it, he would receive the same damage upon himself. Thomas grinned deviously, and gripping the phone tightly, made his way upstairs to his mother \u2019 s room. \n \n \n Slowly he crept, avoiding the steps that he knew would creak if he stepped on them. After what felt like an eternity, he had finally made it upstairs, where he stood outside his mother \u2019 s door. He held his breath. This would be the moment of truth. Slowly he turned the knob. He heard a click, and froze. Nothing. He could hear his mother \u2019 s steady breaths \u2013 a sign she was fast asleep. He pushed the door open, controlling its movement, so it ensured him just enough space to slip in. He made it. There he was, inside her room. There she was, asleep, not a care in the world, unknowing of Thomas \u2019 s true nature, and unknowing of his new found knowledge. \n \n \n He walked over, slowly. There it was. Her iPhone, right on the dresser. No case. She was always the stupid one, he thought. That \u2019 s why daddy had left them. He would show her, after he turned her into another \u201c experiment. \u201d He made his way to the dresser, and picked up her phone. His mother \u2019 s steady breathing stopped abruptly. \n \n \n \u201c Thomas? \u201d He panicked. He began to cry. He had not calculated the sensitivity of her feelings. He must not have picked up the phone gently enough. It was over. She caught him. She knew he was going to experiment on her. He hated her. He hated her for being so stupid. \n \n \n \u201c Thomas, what \u2019 s wrong honey? \u201d His mother sat up in bed wondering what her boy was doing, with two phones, in the middle of the night. \n \n \n Thomas answered only in wails. \n \n \n \u201c Did Santa not come, honey? Shh. It \u2019 s okay. Mommy left your gift right under the tree. It was the Chemistry set you wanted. \n \n \n \u201c You\u2026LIAR! \u201d Thomas choked through tears. \u201c Take this\u2026you UGLY LIAR! \u201d Thomas proceeded to violently throw her phone on the floor, picking it up, and smashing it down once again. The phone was beyond destroyed by this point, its screen shattered and its chassis dented into an irregular shape. Thomas stopped after he had done this five times and looked to see its effects on his mother. \n \n \n She stared at him, teary eyed and confused. \n \n \n \u201c Thomas, why would you do such a terrible thing to mommy \u2019 s phone? Why\u2026 why? \u201d Thomas looked at the phone, and at his mother, and then back to the phone once again, and then dropped to his knees. \n\n"}

{"prompt":"[ WP ] Earth becomes the battleground for two warring alien races , both of which claim to be humanity 's `` protectors ''\n","story":"`` What do you think you're doing here?'' The Pampillian General asked, demanding an answer from the oribiting destroyer. \n \n `` What do you mean? I was about to ask you the same thing, General,'' the Vanquist Commander replied. `` You're in violation of the Astellian Accords. Leave or receive a lethal finding. We protect this planet.'' The Commander signaled his gunner to target the Pampillian Fighter. \n \n `` Are you insane? We're the protectors of this planet.'' The General asked signalling his own gunner. `` We have a Staruthian Rail Gun on board. We'll blow you out of orbit with one shot.'' \n \n `` You'll find that quite impossible. This is a Class 101 Fighter. You could hammer on our shields with that toy rifle of yours for several cycles before it even begins to threaten our shields. Last warning. Leave. Gunner, target their bridge.'' The Pampillian General fixed the Vanquist Commander with a cold penetrating glare. \n \n `` Fire.'' The Vanquist Commander snapped. The rail gun hummed for a moment and a bright silvery streak briefly connected the two star ships. The shields flickered but held. \n \n `` Return Fire!'' The Pampillian General shouted, gripping the console before him in anger. `` You wanted this. Remember that Commander.'' \n Several bright flashes issued from the torpedo bays and followed their targeting with pinpoint precision, but passed through their target unobstructed. They torpedos proceeded to correct their trajectory diving into the star fighter again and again until their propulsion fuel was exhausted. `` What happened?'' \n \n The gunner checked his readings and shrugged. `` I do n't know General. They found no resistance. According to the readings there is n't anything out there.'' \n \n `` Detonate the torpedos anyway.'' The General commanded, watching the viewer as his commands were carried out. A moment later he watched as each of the torpedos exploded. The image fo the star fighter flickered, but more interesting than that, a faint flicker of light appeared off to the right. `` What was that?'' \n \n `` Displacer Cloaking Technology. We ca n't see them, General. Whereever they appear, the real ship will be close, but never where we see it.'' The gunner explained. \n \n `` Then target the area around the displacement.'' The General snapped as another blast from the rail gun pecked away at his shields. \n \n `` As you command, sir.'' A barrage of torpedos blasted forth from their launching tubes, speeding into the blackness of space around the image of the fighter. Plasma fire appeared out of nowhere taking out one of the torpedos. \n \n `` Target that quadrant.'' The General commanded, pointing toward the area where the plasma fire had originated. The image of the star fighter swerved away from the newest volley of torpedos, but the torpedos themselves, they found nothing. Even the command to detonate them manually failed to reveal the Vanquist star fighter. \n \n Another blast of the rail gun rocked the destroyer, but the Pampillian Destroyer's shields held. The General had n't been bluffing. It would take several sleep cycles of constant fire from the rail gun to diminsh their shields. All in all, this fight was doomed to be long and fruitless. The Pampillian Destroyer would run out of torpedos quickly at this rate. Neither commander was optimistic about the outcome of this battle. \n \n The Vanquist Commander must have realized the same, for a moment later a communication request came in from the cloaked ship. \n \n `` Do you surrender?'' The General asked with a smirk. \n \n `` Hardly. But, fighting seems pretty damn fruitless at this point. I'm willing to pursue other avenues.'' The Vanquist Commander admitted. \n \n `` What do you suggest?'' The General asked, open to the idea. `` It would appear we're both protectors of this planet. Verify that with your command. We'll wait. There's no reason we both ca n't protect the planet.'' The commander put his hands behind his back in an at-ease posture indicating he was willing to wait. \n \n It took the General the better part of an hour to verify the information in the Accords, but in the end, it appeared that both of the commanders were in the wrong. They agreed on a truce choosing to prove their trust with a show of good faith. The Starfighter uncloaked suddenly, appearing startlingly close to the Destroyer's starboard side. The Destroyer reciprocated by lowering its shield to half strength. \n \n In the silence of space both commanders congratulated themselves and the crews celebrated the peace. Nobody likes war and it would have ended there except a communication was coming in from the planet below. \n \n `` What do the Earthlings say?'' Both commanders asked, nearly simultaneously. \n \n `` Not sure if I'm reading it write. It's a rather primitive form of communication.'' The Vanquist communications officer replied, studying the message. `` Give me a moment. Earth has many different languages.'' \n \n `` General,'' the Pampillian gunner called, `` we've got movement from several of their orbiting satellites.'' \n \n `` What kind?'' The general asked. \n \n `` Rotation and deployment. The satellites seem to be redeploying and orienting on us and the Vanquist.'' The gunner responded, punching several buttons on his console repeatedly. \n \n `` For what purpose?'' The General asked. \n \n `` Unknown.'' The gunner replied. \n \n `` We're getting movement from several of the Earthlings satellites. You getting this?'' The Vanquist Commander asked. \n \n `` We're seeing it, but not sure what their purpose is. From what we know of it's inhabitants, they're not capable of deep space travel. For all we know, they do n't even know if there's other life beyond their world.'' The General said, looking over to his gunner for more information. \n \n `` They know now,'' The Vanquist communications officer announced suddenly. \n \n `` You've translated their message?'' Both commanders asked, echoing each other. `` What's do they say?'' \n \n `` ET... Go home.'' The communications officer read, furrowing his forehead in confusion. \n \n `` What's an ET.'' The Pampillian General asked. \n \n `` Us, I guess.'' The Vanquist Commander guessed. \n \n `` It's us.'' The gunner replied, suddenly nervous. `` We're the ET.'' \n \n `` How do you know?'' The two commanders asked. \n \n `` They're about to shoot us down.'' The gunner replied. `` The satellites are part of their global defense network.'' \n \n `` Up shields.'' Both commanders called even as the rosebud of light blossomed on the ends of the concealed barrels inside the satellites. \n \n `` That was close,'' The Pampillan General remarked. \n \n `` You're telling me.'' The Vanquist Commander laughed. `` I do n't know what kind of weapons they possess, their technology is far inferior to our own. \n \n `` Not that inferior,'' the gunner stammered in fear. `` Their optic weapons.'' \n \n `` What?!'' Both commanders exclaimed, just before the lasers cut through their kinetic shielding piercing their hull, their fuel cells, and their life support. The general looked down on the planet he was supposed to protect and had time for one final realization before his ship exploded. *I guess they did n't need us to protect them after all. *\n"}
